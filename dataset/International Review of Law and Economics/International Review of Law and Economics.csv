Yet, there is little evidence on how lenders transfer them to borrowers at the mortgage origination. By exploiting the mortgage law heterogeneity across U.S. states, I show that recourse restrictions trigger a collateral channel, through which lenders require a 1.6 to 1.9 percentage points lower loan-to-value ratio to compensate for worse recovery opportunities and respective higher expected loss. This effect holds both before and after the Great Recession, and is robust to a regression discontinuity design approach. I also find that lenders do not penalize strategic defaults when recourse is not allowed. Regarding the impact of judicial requirements, the findings are mixed.","Does mortgage law influence loan contract terms? There are reasons to think that it does. If the law imposes higher risks or costs to lenders, it is reasonable to assume that lenders will pass on these costs to borrowers by raising interest rates or requiring higher loan collateralization. Still, not all aspects of mortgage law should induce the same effects. While some aspects may change the borrower’s probability of default, others may lead to higher recovery costs or longer recovery processes.====Despite its relevance to policy decisions, there is little empirical evidence of how different laws affect mortgage collateralization and price. Most of the contributions studying the influence of the law on mortgage credit focus on the impact on loan size, ignoring other loan contract terms. This is generally due to a lack of microdata on interest rates and house values. In this paper, I address this gap by using an alternative loan-level dataset for the U.S. mortgage market to trace how recourse restrictions and judicial foreclosures influence the mortgage interest rate and the loan-to-value ratio at the origination.====Similar to prior research (e.g., Pence, 2006; Ghent and Kudlyak, 2011; Mian et al., 2015; and Milonas, 2017), I exploit mortgage law heterogeneity across different U.S. states. I classify each state based on two aspects of the law: recourse (formally known as deficiency judgments) and foreclosure procedure. First, state law might not allow for deficiency judgments. If so, the lender cannot seize other assets or income of the borrower to recover the debt. Besides limiting recovery opportunities, this encourages strategic defaults. I classify such states as non-recourse. Second, state law might require a court’s approval to initiate foreclosure, which delays the process and makes it costlier. I classify such states as judicial.====In order to illustrate how recourse restrictions and judicial foreclosures affect loan contract terms, I introduce a conceptual framework for mortgage origination that considers the distinct motivations of lenders and borrowers. This framework highlights the role of the loan-to-value ratio and the mortgage interest rate in determining the loan’s risk and price. Depending on how the law impacts the loan’s expected loss, lenders might either demand greater collateralization (collateral channel) or raise the mortgage interest rate (price channel).====As for the data, comprehensive datasets for the U.S. mortgage market, such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act dataset (HMDA), do not have historical information on mortgage pricing and, thus, are unsuitable for this study. To analyze the effect on loan-to-value ratio and mortgage interest rates, I use Freddie Mac’s Single-Family Loan-Level data from 2001 to 2019 and show that qualitative findings hold for a broader representation of the mortgage market. Given the mortgage market crisis and the Federal Housing Finance Administration’s (FHFA) decision to place Freddie Mac under conservatorship, two distinct sample periods are utilized, with loans granted during the Great Recession (2007 to 2011) being excluded. The interventions during that period were part of a sizable mortgage finance reform with significant changes in the mortgage market (see, for example, Duca et al., 2016).====After examining the potential endogeneity concerns related to the law and the simultaneity of the loan-to-value ratio and the mortgage interest rate, I find that the impacts of mortgage laws are not always similar before and after the Great Recession. Consistently, non-recourse laws led to more collateralized loans with, on average, loan-to-value ratios 1.6 to 1.9 percentage points lower and no significant effect on the interest rate. Therefore, lenders require more collateral to compensate for a lower expectation of recovery, activating a collateral channel. On the other hand, judicial foreclosure requirements seem to prompt higher interest rates and lower loan-to-values before the Great Recession, and a counterintuitive reduction of the interest rates after 2011. This puzzling result hints that studying the implications of the judicial foreclosure processes during the Great Recession might prove to be a promising avenue for future research. Nevertheless, this is out of the scope of this study.====By focusing on the impact of recourse restrictions on the loan’s collateralization levels, I apply a regression discontinuity design approach that furthers robust the findings. I also examine if lenders demand more collateral in non-recourse states as a way to decrease the likeliness of mortgages going into negative equity, and so deter strategic defaults. To investigate this, I use a quantile regression model. Without evidence of this phenomenon, the findings suggest that lenders require more collateral in non-recourse states only to compensate for fewer recovery opportunities.====This paper relates to extensive empirical literature studying the effects of mortgage law heterogeneity on the supply of mortgage credit, mortgage default, and foreclosure.====Regarding the supply of mortgage credit, most contributions measure the law’s impact through loan size. Pence (2006) studies loans originated between 1994 and 1995 and finds that loan sizes are 3 to 7 percent smaller in judicial states. Mian et al. (2015) apply a similar methodology to loans originated in 2005 but find no evidence that average loan sizes or total lending are significantly lower in judicial states. They argue that the effect described by Pence (2006) is diluted over time. A few studies also explore the impact of laws on loan prices, though using aggregate data at the state level. Ghent and Kudlyak (2011) and Pruszkowski (2017) find no difference in mortgage interest rates between recourse and non-recourse states. Ambrose et al. (2004) use loan-level data on 26,179 loans from 1995 to 1997, provided by a national lender. Surprisingly, they find lower interest rates and higher loan-to-value ratios in non-recourse states.====As to the role of mortgage law heterogeneity in mortgage default and foreclosure, in the case of judicial requirement, Mian et al. (2015) find that in non-judicial states, lenders were twice as likely to proceed with the foreclosure during the 2007 mortgage crisis, even if default rates were no different. Desai et al. (2013) show that the effects of judicial requirements and non-recourse laws on default and foreclosure rates are strongest for subprime mortgages and adjustable-rate mortgages. Gerardi et al. (2013) argue that judicial requirements delay the foreclosure process, which for Melzer (2017) creates a debt-overhang problem. In the case of non-recourse law, Gete and Zecchetto (2022) assume that recourse discourages default and argue that countries with mortgage recourse systems face higher nominal rigidities that lead to deeper and more persistent recessions. Other authors ask if negative equity is enough for default (known as strategic default). Ghent and Kudlyak (2011) find that borrowers facing negative equity are more likely to default in non-recourse states, but only for home values above $200,000. Guiso et al. (2013) find evidence of strategic default and conclude that personal values also play a role in the decision. Demiroglu et al. (2014) inspect whether judicial foreclosures interact with non-recourse to affect the likelihood of default on residential mortgages and conclude that it is only significant for borrowers with negative equity.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the mortgage law heterogeneity in the U.S. In Section 3, I present a conceptual framework of mortgage origination and the respective influence of mortgage law. Section 4 describes the data, Section 5 the empirical strategy, and Section 6 the results. Section 7 shows the regression discontinuity design approach on the impact of recourse restrictions on the loan-to-value ratio. Section 8 explores the effect of non-recourse along the conditional distribution of the loan-to-value ratio.

However, a country’s legal structure also conditions the primary distribution of income and may have a comparative advantage over taxation as a distributive instrument. We use cross-section and panel estimates to show that the level of income ====.","As stated by Keynes (1931), “the political problem of mankind is to combine three things: Economic Efficiency, Social Justice, and Individual Liberty”. Societies build institutions aiming to achieve different and potentially conflicting objectives. The international differences in outcomes may result from specific national preferences but also from contrasting levels of effectiveness of institutions in pursuing each of these goals. Focusing mainly on economic efficiency, La Porta et al. (2008) have shown that it is possible to associate legal families with significant differences in terms of investors’ protection. While the seminal paper of this literature focused on financial law (Porta et al. (1998)) a series of subsequent articles have extended the analysis to other institutions related to economic activity and state control. For each topic, they exhibited systematic differences in legal institutions and economic outcomes, depending on countries’ “legal origins”. Their conception of legal origins was a broad one referring to a style of social control, the main difference being related to the state’s capacity to control economic life. In their terms, “common law stands for the strategy of social control that seeks to support private market outcomes, whereas civil law seeks to replace such outcomes with state-desired allocations”. While strong criticisms have been made about some specific results,==== their whole work produces a bundle of clues that support their overall thesis. However, they fail to derive an important implication of their approach concerning societies’ capacities to manage their social justice objectives efficiently. Empirical evidence shows that countries perform very differently with respect to their ability to address the universal concern of economic inequalities. We argue that some part of the systematic differences observed in terms of inequality can be explained by the legal rules of countries and therefore by legal origins, understood as a style of social control over economic life. In civil law systems, the greater importance of the state in the production of legal norms helps to limit the primary production of inequalities. The state’s mandate to represent society as a whole gives it the legitimacy to produce laws that pursue social objectives. An illuminating example is provided by the French state which permanently produces laws designed to control the distribution of revenues derived from market activities, for example by imposing limits on private contracting in labor relations or between buyers and suppliers.==== Judge-made law, aimed mainly at resolving legal disputes, is less suited to pursuing social goals involving agents other than the parties to a trial.====The Law & Economics literature is aware of the distributive aspects of legal rules, but the emphasis has been placed mainly on economic efficiency. The debate began with Posner (2014) and his popular common law efficiency thesis. For him, the common law is an efficient process of creation of legal norms due to the behavior of appointed judges looking for efficient outcomes. Rubin (1977), Priest (1977), and Goodman (1978) highlighted other arguments as to why common law was efficient. This theoretical approach has influenced the subsequent empirical literature on the effects of legal systems. Some authors have sought to demonstrate a connection between legal tradition and the level of economic and financial development. La Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (LLSV) have published several articles demonstrating that common law countries are associated with better investor protection, better contract enforcement, and a greater respect for private property (see La Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008), for a survey). As a result, these countries seemingly benefit from greater economic efficiency than civil law countries marked by the influence of the Napoleonic Code. Subsequent works have supplemented or tempered the impact of the common law on economic and financial development (e.g. Mahoney (2001), La Porta et al. (2002b), and Levine (1999)). Debates have focused on methodological issues and the quality of empirical treatments (Spamann (2006), Rostowski and Stacescu (2006), Kim (2009), Xu (2011), or Klerman et al. (2011)). In this vein, a recent stream of literature has emerged to explain the controversy between the classical assumptions of companies’ goals and recent empirical evidence concerning the rising trend of investments in social and environmental activities. As the country’s legal system contributes to defining the social mechanisms for controlling economic activity, it implicitly shapes the agreements between companies and their stakeholders (including shareholders). Liang and Renneboog (2016) show that legal origin is an important determinant of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in firms. This result highlights the relevant role that a country’s legal system plays in promoting sustainable policies and investments, finding that financial firms based in civil law countries present higher ESG scores than those based in common law countries. The paper also shows that state investment in the capital of the companies studied, in civil law systems, is also a factor that reinforces the incentive for companies to invest more in the environmental transition. This is consistent with our analysis of the way in which countries with a civil law tradition, particularly France, seek to satisfy social justice objectives and not just economic efficiency objectives. Another important question concerns the relevance of the classification among legal families. For instance, rather than finding a clear-cut common versus civil law division, Chang et al. (2021) observe that the France-inspired group forms a supercluster, separate from other jurisdictions. It might be more relevant to consider specific legal topics rather than the overall legal systems (see e.g. Bradford et al. (2021) suggesting that shared legal origins predict the similarity in countries’ property laws, but they do little to predict similarity in antitrust laws. More rarely, the question of the nature and foundations of legal systems has been addressed (Glaeser and Shleifer 2002, Roe 2007, Klerman and Mahoney 2007, or Crettez et al. 2018).====One subject that has not been much discussed is whether the objective of legal systems can be reduced to the question of economic efficiency alone. The approach developed by LLSV makes the protection of private property the central element of good economic governance, insofar as it maximizes individual incentives to invest, produce, and undertake (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (La Porta et al., 2002a, La Porta et al., 2006). Concerning financial topics, for example, LLSV adopt exclusively the point of view of the interests of shareholders, and thus give precedence to the question of value creation. This has steered thinking in a direction that emphasizes the question of resource allocation without looking at the distributive aspects in relation to the treatment of economic inequalities.==== By focusing on the protection of shareholders, it seems clear that the objective sought, from a normative point of view, is to maximize the value of the firm, which is questionable (see e.g. Deffains et al. (2021)). These questions are also present in the World Bank’s new ==== project, which aims to replace the ==== ranking and to take into account “stakeholder” considerations such as the protection of workers and environmental sustainability. Pistor (2019) has recently shown how the law impacts the revenue of capital assets and the concentration of wealth.==== The distributive implications of law and legal systems are central and deserve more attention. In this article, we aim to provide a first comparative analysis of the performance of legal systems in terms of reducing income inequality. Only a few articles have examined this issue empirically (Islam 2016, Easterly 2007, Maggio et al. 2014, and Ferguson et al. 2017). The results are contrasted. Some results establish a significant link between legal tradition and the Gini coefficient while others conclude there is no such correlation. We supplement these studies by proposing a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between legal systems and inequalities in order to understand to what extent these systems reflect economic concerns other than economic efficiency. Since the French Revolution, the question of the development of nations has not been limited to the measurement of productive efficiency, but has also been raised about the nature of the social contract and the setting up of institutions capable of ensuring the protection of individuals through social policies and solidarity mechanisms in the face of growing inequalities. The growing literature on inequalities (Atkinson et al. 2011 and Piketty, 2014, Piketty, 2020) has also left aside legal questions as explanatory factors of the observations made (an exception being Pistor 2019).====The degree of centralization of the production of legal norms and judicial decisions contributes to explaining the distributive differences between common law and civil law (e.g. Deffains and Musy 2018). In common law countries, the production of legal norms appears less centralized than in civil law countries, where the legislator is the main source of new legal norms. Damaska 1986 argues that civil law is policy implementing, while common law is dispute resolving. Given the lesser importance of the state, for La Porta et al. 2008, quoting Pistor 2005, the common law is designed to support “’unconditioned private contracting’ while French civil law embraces’socially-conditioned private contracting”’. The primacy of the law established at a centralized level implies that legal developments often reflect trade-offs inherent in public choices that incorporate a multiplicity of social objectives, among which the protection of individuals and freedom of contract are only component parts. Legal systems supposedly thus reflect potentially different trade-offs in the scope accorded to the defense of individual and general interests. The centralized, coordinated approach of civil law may have a comparative advantage over common law when pursuing social objectives. We show that inequalities depend on the legal systems and that, on average, they are not as great in civil law countries.====The purpose of this article is to fill a gap by discussing how the law deals not only with the allocative but also the distributive aspects that jointly characterize the functioning of any society. We argue that the counterpart of the greater efficiency of the common law may be its lesser capability to control economic inequalities. Distributive issues are not absent from the Law & Economic literature, but the classic position is to think of redistribution exclusively through the prism of the tax system. The main argument in favor of redistribution solely through the tax system is that of the double distortion introduced by Kaplow and Shavell 1994. The tax system is inherently distorting to the economy but addresses equity concerns, while the legal system is also distorting but supposedly less effective than the tax system at redistribution. For the proponents of the double distortion, it is not relevant to have two distorting systems and it would therefore be preferable to resort to the more efficient system for redistribution, i.e. the tax system. The legal system should thus only address efficiency concerns. In a way, the work of LLSV can be seen as extending this approach into the empirical arena by moving the debate in the direction of investigating the effects of legal systems solely from the point of view of the efficient allocation of resources.====This article is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present the mechanism by which the law contributes to limiting income inequalities. We argue that the law has a social conditioning role that contributes to conditioning the distribution of income through ex-ante regulatory mechanisms. Section 3 provides a new empirical correlation between legal systems and pre-tax income inequality. Section 4 discusses the results and the extent to which these differences between common law and civil law groups can be attributed to legal systems, each system reflects a preferred view of the state in a market economy. In Section 5, we provide new insight into the comparative economic performance of legal systems across income inequalities. We justify the differences between civil law and common law through the study of the French case and its evaluations during the last 200 years.

While Moody and Lott claim to have found that shall-issue and permitless-carry laws reduce homicide using data ending in 2014, our event-study analysis demonstrates that their model violates the conditional parallel-trends assumption. Additionally, applying methodology from Broderick et al. (2021), we show Moody and Lott’s results are highly sensitive to the removal of a small number of observations. We examine and reject Moody and Lott’s hypothesis that early- and late-adopting “shall-issue” states experienced different outcomes through sensitivity testing of their early–late threshold and applying the Goodman-Bacon (2021) decomposition. Following De Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (2020), we show Moody and Lott’s results are biased by heterogeneous ====. Overall, our results highlight the importance of conducting principled validity and sensitivity checks before introducing outlier estimates into the empirical literature.","The last quarter of the 20th-century witnessed substantial expansion of the right-to-carry (RTC) concealed handguns in the United States. Most states that chose to deregulate gun carrying initially adopted “shall-issue” statutes, defined as laws mandating that authorities shall issue a concealed-carry permit to any individual who requests one with only narrow exceptions. In 1975, five states allowed the carrying of concealed handguns in public. An additional eight states adopted shall-issue laws in the 1980s and another 18 states did so in the 1990s. While Lott and Mustard (1997), using a staggered-adoption difference-in-differences design, found that shall-issue laws decreased crime, other scholars in the late 1990s came to different conclusions (see e.g. Dezhbakhsh and Rubin, 1998, Ludwig, 1998 and Black and Nagin (1998)). The recent literature has been able to take advantage of longer panels with greater treatment variation, which has enabled a strong body of evidence to emerge that the criminogenic effects of RTC dominate any deterrence effect, leading to an overall increase in violent crime. ==== in ====, cited 14 studies in the last five years that found that RTC laws increased violent crime, and further confirming studies continue to be completed (Van Der Wal, 2022, Doucette et al., 2022b, Donohue et al., 2022, Doucette et al., 2022a). RAND has conducted an assessment of the entire literature on RTC laws and has now concluded, at its highest evidence rating, that RTC laws increase total and firearm homicides (RAND Corporation, 2023).====The past decade has seen a second wave of concealed-carry deregulation. Perhaps the most notable legal event has been the Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision in ==== to strike down New York’s statute requiring that individuals prove “proper cause” in order to obtain a concealed carry permit. In effect, the Court’s decision has laid the foundation for a nationwide individual right to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon. But about half of the states have already deregulated further than shall-issue regimes by adopting “permitless carry” (also known as “constitutional carry”) regimes which do not require individuals to have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. This latest deregulatory trend is so recent that the vast majority of the states moving to permitless carry did so since 2015. In light of this, it is not surprising that Moody and Lott (2022), a paper arguing that concealed carry laws reduce homicide, is the only peer-reviewed article that focuses on attempting to estimate the separate effect of permitless carry on homicide rates.==== A survey of the current peer-reviewed literature indicates that most empirical studies of RTC regimes try to estimate the combined effect of both shall-issue and permitless carry on violent crime.====The recent work of Moody and Lott (2022) that attempts to influence the current public policy debate on permitless carry==== follows the same pattern of the earlier work of Lott and Mustard (1997), in which their enthusiastic early results from a limited number of states adopting right-to-carry laws energized the adoption of these laws across the country. This wave of deregulation then allowed researchers to benefit from many more years of post-treatment data and more adopting states to amass a strong body of evidence that RTC laws tend to ==== violent crime, as noted above. The lessons from this previous experience suggest caution in drawing conclusions about the impact of permitless carry from the very limited data examined by Moody and Lott, which only extends through 2014. This history highlights one of the challenges in the realm of empirical work, where policymakers need to make choices today – when the possibilities for valid inference may be highly constrained – while the literature might not coalesce around a strong and reliable conclusion for years or even decades until adequate data are available and rigorously analyzed. It took that long to generate sufficient data for a consensus to emerge – as reflected in the RAND judgment – that shall-issue laws lead to higher crime rates. At this point, we do not have anywhere near that amount of data for permitless carry laws.====The issue of concealed-carry policy at this moment is a topic of high political salience at both the state and national level. Given the rapid adoption of permitless carry across many states and the uncertain status of concealed-carry policy in New York and the seven other states with similarly restrictive concealed carry laws in light of the ==== decision, it is imperative that decision-makers have an accurate understanding of the empirical landscape. A significant challenge for the public, policymakers, and courts is that the large number of possible specification choices means that researchers can generate a wide range of estimated effects of concealed carry laws on crime, not all of which are equally valid.====In this article, we perform reasonable robustness and sensitivity analyses on Moody and Lott (2022) and try to set forth a principled set of objective tests of the validity of various modeling assumptions that they neglected but are advisable for all similar state panel data analyses. Using event-study regressions and a robustness-assessment procedure developed by Broderick et al. (2021), we illustrate that the Moody and Lott permitless-carry and shall-issue models do not identify a causal effect and depend on a handful of anomalous observations from low-population states. We argue that these findings reflect insufficient treatment variation leading to improperly calculated standard errors in the case of permitless carry and deeper model specification concerns. We also analyze Moody and Lott’s hypothesis that the states that were earlier to adopt shall-issue laws experienced the greatest reductions in homicide, and show that the results hinge on an arbitrary cut-off. Furthermore, we draw on recent innovations in the econometrics literature that has shown heterogeneous treatment effects can produce biased average treatment effects using standard OLS two-way fixed effects models (Roth et al., 2022) in two ways. First, we use Goodman-Bacon (2021) decomposition to examine the average treatment effect of shall-issue laws on homicide conditional on year of adoption. While the size of the treatment effect does not appear to be wholly independent of the year of adoption, it does not follow the early-versus-late distinction that Moody and Lott propose. Second, we correct for the bias caused by heterogeneous treatment effects using the estimator by De Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (2020), and find that when one applies this estimator to Moody and Lott’s data and covariates, the average effect of shall-issue and permitless-carry laws on homicide rates are both ====, although there is no evidence of significance.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the empirical modeling decisions in Moody and Lott (2022) and presents our attempt at an exact replication of their results. We use this replication as a baseline for our subsequent analysis testing the robustness of Moody and Lott (2022)’s findings. In Section 3, we conduct an event-study analysis to examine the likelihood that Moody and Lott’s shall-issue and permitless-carry models adhere to the conditional parallel-trends assumption, keeping with standard practice in the difference-in-differences literature. Given that the event-study plots undermine the parallel-trends assumption and thus any causal claim about the impact of permitless carry, we next test in Section 4 whether small variations in the data are driving the coefficients and standard errors in the static models. In Section 5, we test the sensitivity of Moody and Lott’s heterogeneity analysis and how heterogeneous treatment effects may be biasing the results of their static two-way fixed effects models. In Section 6, we summarize and discuss the implications of our findings for future research.",Estimating the effect of U.S. concealed carry laws on homicide: A replication and sensitivity analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818823000194,15 May 2023,2023,Research Article,2.0

We show that when criminals are risk averse, greater variability in punishment reduces the incentive to commit crimes, and that the opposite holds in the case of risk loving. The linkages between certainty of punishment, initial ==== and the incentive to commit crimes are also analyzed. We then analyze the effects of greater variability in punishment on deterrence policies founded on punishment severity, showing that this effect is positive if criminals are prudent and negative if they are imprudent. Lastly, we analyze for the first time variability in punishment as an instrument of deterrence policy. This analysis determines the optimal level of variability in the two cases of homogeneity and heterogeneity in risk preference.","The idea that severity and certainty of punishment are crucial for crime deterrence dates back to the classical works of Beccaria (1764) and Bentham (1823). Starting from the seminal paper by Becker (1968) this idea has also been studied using an economic approach. This approach confirms the significance of both severity and certainty of punishment, and research often discusses their relative importance (e.g. Mungan, 2017, Mungan, 2019, Pyne, 2012).====A further significant element potentially affecting deterrence, which has to date been somewhat neglected, is variability in punishment. It is often the case, in fact, that the law indicates a range of possible fines rather than laying down a specific fine for a particular crime. This means that the punishment is variable rather than given.====Variability in punishment may affect agent decisions on whether or not to commit a crime when (potential) criminals are not risk neutral. The risk attitude of criminals has in fact been analyzed in previous literature, but the role of variability in punishment has never been addressed. The first aim of this work is to fill this gap.====Moreover, when agents are not risk neutral, the level of wealth they have before choosing whether to commit a crime (their initial wealth) may also affect their choice. The second aim of this work is to address this issue, also studying possible interactions between initial wealth and certainty of punishment.====A further aim of this work is to study how variability in punishment affects the optimal level of traditional crime deterrence policies, acting on punishment severity. The results of this analysis show the specific aspects of DM preferences which determine the effects of variability in this case.====Moreover, since punishment variability influences the choice on whether or not to commit a crime, it can be also directly used as an instrument for deterrence policies. The last aim of this work is to study this kind of policy, which is to my knowledge novel to the literature, and determine the optimal level of punishment variability in these interventions. This issue is analyzed considering different types of policies and it is examined both in the case where criminals have homogeneous preferences toward risk and in the case where preferences are heterogeneous. Our results in this field show that optimal variability is higher when potential criminals are risk averse or, in the case of heterogeneity in preferences, when the fraction of risk averse DMs among potential criminals is larger.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature overview. Section 3 examines the effects of variability in punishment for individual choices on committing crimes. Section 4 analyzes the role of initial wealth under different assumptions on preferences toward risk.

Accordingly, we exploit the availability of a unique dataset comprising legal fees that Indian corporations have spent over a 30-year period from 1990 to 2020. We undertake the first cross-sectional analysis of legal fees across various exploratory variables over a long period of time. The results show an increasing trend in the quantum of legal fees incurred by Indian companies during the period. They overwhelmingly suggest that large companies (measured along the lines of total assets, ","A significant challenge confronts legal departments of companies. On the one hand, the demand for legal services from external counsel continues to skyrocket given the increasing complexity of the legal environment in which companies operate and the onerous nature of compliance requirements (Friedman, 2007). On the other hand, in-house legal teams have come under intense pressure from management to bring about drastic reductions to legal costs (Armitage et al., 2014, Barton, 2014). Both the global financial crisis in the late 2000s and the pandemic more recently have focused the attention on practices of companies in the procurement of external legal services, compelling them to be more creative about arrangements with external counsel to extract greater value at competitive prices (Silverstein, 2016, Watson and Brzakala, 2021).====These developments necessitate that legal procurement by companies be “increasingly data-and-metrics driven” (Hodges, 2012) and reliant on “evidence-based rationales for major reductions in legal spending” (Silverstein, 2016). The role of data analytics in modern legal engagement cannot be understated (Rapoport and Tiano, 2019). At what stages during their lifecycles do companies spend extensively, if at all, on legal fees? What types of companies incur greater legal spending? Do larger companies necessarily spend more than smaller ones? Do companies with greater exposure to global markets spend more than those without? Do companies in certain industries spend more than companies in other industries?====Despite the criticality of these questions in the sphere of corporate legal procurement, there are numerous obstacles to obtaining data on specific fee arrangements between corporations and law firms representing them due to the private nature of their relationship. Available studies regarding legal fees in various markets are either anecdotal, survey-based or limited to specific time-spans (Maheshri and Winston, 2014). We seek to fill this gap through our empirical study using a comprehensive dataset of legal fees that corporations in India have incurred annually over a 30-year period from 1990 to 2020. To our knowledge, there is no prior academic work that analyzes legal fees incurred by corporations across multiple variables over such a long time-horizon.====The study of the legal expenses in India is interesting for at least two reasons. First, India is unique in that data on legal spending are available over a sufficiently extensive period to enable a meaningful empirical analysis regarding the trends and determinants of legal fees that corporations expend. Second, India’s economic liberalization in 1991 caused its product and investment markets to open up, thereby enabling its corporate legal sector to grow exponentially (Wilkins et al. 2017). This presents us with an interesting setting to explore the various determinants of legal fees in such a market.====Through our study, we show that several characteristics relating to the legal environment in India have been exhibiting an increasing trend over time. For example, the total legal fees spent in the economy each year have been increasing during the period of our study. However, during this time the size of the Indian economy has also been growing and, hence, we examine the average legal fees spent by a company each year, which has also been increasing over time. In terms of transactional legal work, there has been a considerable growth in investments (both foreign and domestic), capital raising, and other similar corporate transactions, all of which signify a growing demand for legal services. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) tend to appear in waves, and hence do not demonstrate consistent time trends. In sum, the legal environment has been rapidly expanding in India.====Our study is based on a sample that consists of 174,921 firm-year observations of limited liability companies from the Prowess database,==== which meet the data requirements. The company specific determinants of legal fees spent by corporations are company size, export and import status, state of incorporation, significant corporate events, and industry membership. Company size is the most important determinant of legal fees, in that larger companies spend more on legal fees than do small company. We proxy for company size with the total assets of the company, and whether a firm is a multi-segment firm or not. Companies that export goods and services to other countries, or import goods and services from other countries, contend with laws in India as well as in the importing (or exporting) country and hence spend more on legal fees than companies which sell to or buy from only the domestic market. Four states, being Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu are the most industrialized states in India and their courts have original jurisdiction over civil and commercial matters beyond a specified monetary value (Hebbar et al. 2021). The companies incorporated in these states spend more on legal fees than do companies incorporated in other states in India.====Companies engage in significant corporate events like issuing securities, either in an initial public offering (IPO) or in a secondary equity offering. Companies also issue debt and commercial paper in the capital markets. External law firms play an important role in drafting and filing documents with regulators, vetting the prospectus related to the securities issuance and in advising the company on related legal issues. We find that companies that engage the capital markets to issue securities spend more on legal fees than companies who do not have any significant corporate events in a given financial year. A second type of significant corporate event is a merger or acquisition (M&A). Companies can be either acquirers or targets in an M&A transaction. Companies that are a party to an M&A have to structure the transaction, conduct due diligence, prepare and enter into contracts involving reams of documents, and file some of these documents with regulators, all of which are usually handled by external law firms who specialize in the legal aspects related to an M&A. Hence, we expect, and find, that both acquirers and targets spend significantly more on legal fees than do companies who do not have any significant corporate event in a financial year. Since significant corporate events are undertaken by specific types of companies, we use a propensity score matching process to obtain the above-described results.====Extant accounting literature classifies the litigation risk of a company based on the industry of which it is a member (Kim and Skinner, 2012). For example, Francis, et al. (1994) code high litigation risk companies as those which are in the biotech, computer, electronics, and retail industries. We find that technology companies and companies in the energy sector in India spend higher legal fees on average than do companies in other industries.====We contribute to the literature in two significant ways. First, our paper is the first to describe the cross section of legal fees across companies in a single market over a sustained period of time. Such an analysis of legal fees is significant given the intense fee-sensitivity displayed by the legal market, the need for further data analysis for purchasers and providers of legal service, and the unavailability of public information regarding fees at the level of each engagement or even each purchaser-provider relationship for legal services. Second, we show empirically that larger companies spend more on legal fees. Companies who engage the stock market to issue equity or debt securities also spend more on legal fees. Both acquirers and targets in an M&A also spend higher amounts on legal fees. Companies in high tech and the energy industries spend more on legal fees, presumably because they face higher legal, contracting and regulatory risk.====At one level, critics may argue that the findings in this paper are consistent with obvious expectations, but our effort herein is to empirically test the validity of conventional wisdom and available anecdotal evidence. Our findings regarding the determinants of legal fees would not only enable market players to calibrate these factors in structuring their engagements for legal services, but they would also provide the opportunity for researchers to analyze legal fees in other markets (subject to the availability of data) or to undertake further in-depth studies across one or more determinants of legal fees. This paper would also contribute to the broader literature surrounding the legal profession, including any regulation surrounding the quantum and design of legal fees in India, and generate appropriate discourse in other related jurisdictions as well.====As for limitations, we note that the definition of legal fees in the Prowess database can include some noise. As some companies combine legal fees with certain other charges, it is impossible for Prowess to separate legal fees from those other charges, and hence the two are reported as legal fees. Furthermore, we use the legal fees for standalone companies rather than from consolidated financial statements and, if there is some cross subsidization of legal fees of companies within the same group, we are unable to control for such cross subsidization.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a background to the corporate legal sector in India. Section 3 sets out a literature review containing comparative studies in the field of audit fees, and develops the metrics for analyzing legal fees. Section 4 outlines the dataset we use in this study and delineates the sample selection process. Section 5 contains the empirical evidence and analysis thereon. It begins with a study of the economy-wide trends and then focuses on several company-level determinants of legal fees.

Vietnamese insiders must announce their trading intentions in advance as well as after the actual trade, which contrasts with the vast majority of countries where only post-trade announcement is mandatory. This regulatory setting allows to put to test the predictions from the theoretical models of advance disclosures (Huddart et al., 2004, Lenkey, 2014). Consistent with the theoretical literature, we find that the abnormal returns are large and significant after the pre-trade announcement, showing that the market takes into consideration the information content of the insiders' intention to trade. In addition, no significant stock price effect is found after the announcement of the actual trade occurrence or cancellation. We argue in favor of the implementation of advance disclosure policies since they help mitigate the returns obtained by insiders, better share the profits with outsiders and contribute to a better information dissemination.","In the past decades, most countries’ regulatory authorities have invested many resources to design regulation and laws against insider trading. The designed policies intend to prevent market abuses and enhance market fairness, with the basic idea that corporate insiders have to report their trades to a public registry of insider trading in order to make their actions visible to the public. There is a long-standing empirical and theoretical literature on legal insider trading, beginning with Lorie and Niederhoffer (1968).====Legal insider trading is defined as the trading activities conducted by managers and directors of listed companies when they trade their own firms’ stocks in compliance with existing regulation, which prohibits the use of private and price-sensitive information. However, insiders have a better view of the prospects of their company, so that the profitability of their trades might be higher than that of outsiders, even when their trading actions are in line with the existing regulation. Due to the unfair access to corporate information, the regulation in almost all countries stipulates that insiders have to announce their trades in a public registry of insider trading hosted either by the stock market or by the regulatory body. In developed stock markets, insiders have to publicly announce their trades without delay and no later than three or five trading days following their trade completion, depending on the country. It is for instance the case for the U.S., the U.K., and most European countries.====Contrary to most other countries in the world in which insiders must disclose their trades of own company's stock to the regulator once the trade is complete, the Vietnamese regulation stipulates that insiders must publicly announce their trade intentions at least three days prior to the actual trade execution. In Vietnam, the national regulation imposes insiders to report three elements associated with their trading activity. First, the insiders have to disclose their intention to trade before trading, that we refer to as trade request or pre-trade announcement. Second, if the trade actually occurs, the second disclosure is to confirm the trade and announce the trade price that we denote a trade completion announcement. Third, if the insider changes her mind and decides not to trade, she is required to report the cancellation of the trade, that we call trade cancellation announcement. As such, each insider has two disclosures to submit for each transaction: the pre-trade announcement, on the one hand and, the trade completion or cancellation, on the other hand. After the trade request announcement is made, Vietnamese insiders are allowed to execute the trades in a one-and-a-half-month period, or they can choose to cancel the trade. Vietnamese insiders have to publicly announce the trade completion within three trading days after they complete the execution or, if the trade intent is cancelled, at the end of the time period.====The Vietnamese regulation follows a similar spirit, yet with very different implementation elements, as the SEC rule 10b5-1 in the U.S. related to pre-determined plans of insider trading. According to this rule, insiders can announce in advance to the regulator a trading plan in the future. Similar to the Vietnamese regulation, U.S. insiders can cancel their trading plans. However, rule 10b5-1 assumes that a plan is done in good faith and before the acquisition of private and price-sensitive information. As such, trading plans are not mandatorily announced to the public, nor the cancellation of trading plans. In addition, rule 10b5-1 acts as a ""safe haven"", or affirmative defense, in court. As a consequence, the literature suggests that insiders use this 10b5-1 regulation to actually trade upon private and price-sensitive information, especially when trading plans are made a few days before the actual trading date, or when a trading pan is cancelled, which effectively acts as a free put or call option. Rule 10b5-1 has been analyzed theoretically by Lenkey (2019), and empirically by Jagolinzer (2009), Lee (2020), Milian (2016), Robbins (2010), and Mitts (2020), among others.====Given its specificity, the Vietnamese market is an interesting area of study. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze empirically such a regulation that enforces pre-trade announcements. The motivation for such an analysis is based on calls from legal scholars to implement such a regulation framework in the U.S. (see for instance, Fried, 1998, Fried, 2006; Bebchuk and Fried, 2010, Bebchuk and Fried, 2003). According to these authors, this regulation would increase the fairness of the stock market by reducing the profitability of insiders’ trades, which is perceived to be unethical and unlawful.====In a more recent study and one of the seminal works in the field, Lenkey (2014) models the effects of an advance disclosure policy. Our empirical analysis builds on this model. According to the author, advance disclosure exposes the insider to price risk which causes her to trade less aggressively. Risk sharing between insiders and outsiders is improved but this comes at the cost of a lower market efficiency because of a slower price discovery process. We discuss Lenkey (2014)’s model extensively. Our analysis is the first one to test the implications of this model on real data.====We study the market reactions around initial trade request announcements, trade completion announcements and trade cancelation announcements. Our methodology grounds on event studies and cross-sectional regression in a similar manner as in Fidrmuc et al. (2006). Using data spanning from January 2009 to December 2015 on a total of 1301 insider trade announcements, we find that the market reaction following sale requests is more dramatic than for purchase requests, amounted at − 2.39 % versus 1.50 % over 30-trading day post-event, both figures are significant at the 1 % level. Sales completion announcements deliver an additional significant negative abnormal return. However, purchase confirmations, on one side, and trade cancelations for both buy and sell transactions, on the other side, deliver insignificant or no abnormal returns in the following 30-trading day period. Overall, insider trade requests convey the majority of the information content of insider trading. When analyzing the drivers of the abnormal returns, we find that trade requests from more informed insiders deliver larger abnormal returns than less informed insiders, which is consistent with the theory of information hierarchy. Furthermore, the holding of insiders prior to their purchase announcements is positively associated with the abnormal returns.====The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background and the literature related to legal insider trading. Section 3 provides an overview of the institutional and regulatory setting of the Vietnamese stock market. Section 4 highlights the key theoretical elements as well as the main hypotheses of our study. Section 5 is devoted to the data description. Section 6 presents and discusses the results.

Notably, it has contributed to a reduction in life expectancy as opioid-involved mortality rate increased from 3.67 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12.46 per 100,000 in 2015 (Case and Deaton, 2017, Case and Deaton., 2015; Ruhm, 2018)—a more than 200% increase over 16 years. Recent studies have suggested that the epidemic was facilitated by a combination of liberalized medical practices dealing with patients’ pain in the 1990s and aggressive marketing by a pharmaceutical firm, Purdue Pharma. Convinced by Purdue and other manufacturers that pain had not been treated sufficiently in the past and encouraged by marketing incentives, physicians started aggressively prescribing opium- based drugs. This led to a rapid increase in the number of prescription opioid addicts (US Government Accountability Office 2003; Kolodny et al. 2015; Jones et al. 2018). Among the prescription drugs, OxyContin has been perceived as the primary contributor of the opioid epidemic (Cicero et al., 2005, Alpert et al., 2022). OxyContin, a long-acting pain reliever, was introduced to the market in 1996 by Purdue Pharma to replace their old product, MS Contin. Purdue aggressively marketed OxyContin to expand the market for prescription opioid analgesics (GAO 2003).====To understand the economic costs of the opioid crisis, researchers have examined the causal relationship between the availability of prescription opioids and a wide range of social outcomes, such as drug overdose, overdose-related mortality rates (Alpert et al., 2022, Arteaga and Victoria, 2021, Ruhm, 2018), labor market outcomes (Krueger, 2017, Aliprantis et al., 2019, Harris et al., 2020, Park and Powell, 2021), and child well-being (Buckles et al., 2020, Evans et al., 2022). However, the consequences of this epidemic on crime remain relatively unknown with two working papers considering prescription drug monitoring policies (Mallat 2018; Dave et al., 2021). Because of the high social costs of crime, especially violent crime, this is a crucial omission in the literature.====In this paper, I study the effects of the OxyContin’s introduction to the market on crime by leveraging geographic variation in the distribution of OxyContin throughout the U.S. I follow Alpert et al. (2022) in relying on a state-level prescription policy called the triplicate prescription program to identify the cross-state variation in the supply of OxyContin. “Triplicate” programs were intended to prevent the diversion of controlled substances such as opioid drugs by requiring multiple copies when prescribing Schedule II drugs==== one of which was filed with the state to allow monitoring of prescribing behavior. When OxyContin was introduced in the U.S., the triplicate prescription system was operational in five states (California, Idaho, Illinois, New York, and Texas), which naturally created cross-state variation in the degree of exposure to OxyContin. Additionally, over time the gap between triplicate and non-triplicate states grew as Purdue targeted marketing promotions to less regulated jurisdictions. Fernandez and Zejcirovic (2018) showed that doctors who received a promotion for opioid drugs, for example Purdue Pharma’s marketing strategy, tended to write more prescriptions for opioid analgesics.====Using data from the Offense Known segment of the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) combined with a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, I find that non-triplicate states at the time of OxyContin’s introduction experienced a relative rise in both violent (25%) crimes and property crime (12%) compared to states with the triplicate pre- scription policy (triplicate states). Non-triplicate states experienced a persistent rise in violent crime before declining in 2014–2016, though effects for these years are elevated. The largest effects for property crime are concentrated among the first five years after OxyContin entered the market (until 2000). Among violent crimes and property crimes, aggravated assault and burglary increased the most, respectively. While I do not find evidence of pre-treatment differential trends between the two groups for violent crimes, differential pre-trends appear for property crimes. Consequently, I cannot draw a strong conclusion about the causal relationship between the introduction of OxyContin and property crimes with this study’s identification strategy.====To shed light on the structural effects of OxyContin on crime, I instrument for the number of opioid (OxyContin and oxycodone) prescriptions per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries using the status of the triplicate prescription program. In line with extant studies on the deterrence effects of the triplicate prescription policy against overprescribing opioid drugs (Berina et al., 1985, Alpert et al., 2022), I find that opioid drugs were prescribed more often in non-triplicate states by 44 per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries after the intro- duction of OxyContin. The triplicate-status-based IV estimates show that both property and violent crimes increase with an additional opioid prescription per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries by 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. In turn, these estimates indicate that non- triplicate states experienced rises in both property and violent crimes by 13.2% and 22% relative to triplicate states. The size of the IV estimates is comparable to that of the DID estimates.====To investigate these findings further, I conduct a series of checks of the sensitivity of results to alternative samples and placebo-type tests. Because of pre-trend differences across states, I also estimate synthetic control models. In addition, I perform the event- study analysis under different assumptions on pre-treatment difference in trends using a recently developed econometric technique by Rambachan and Roth (2020). Together, these alternative specifications provide confidence that the interpretation of a significant divergence in crime (especially violent crime) trends occurred due to the introduction of OxyContin.====The existing studies have shown that chronic drug use can affect crime through various channels. For instance, the demand for OxyContin itself could have become a motive of criminal behavior. Felson and Staff (2017) revealed that 30% of property offenders and 27% of drug offenders committed property crime to generate income to purchase drugs.==== In addition to the financial motive, the expanding market for the prescription opioid drugs could have generated the illegal drug market, driving up the prevalence of violent crimes. Empirical evidence suggests that drug users may consume illegal drugs such as heroin as a substitute for prescription opioid drugs (Alpert et al. 2018; Mallat 2018). Further, it is known that gangs are systematically involved with the illegal drug distribution (Levitt and Venkatesh 2000) and that the nature of the illegal market with the existence of gangs is associated with a rise in violence (Miron, 1999; Levitt and Rubio 2005). I consider two additional potential channels through which OxyContin might have impacted crime. First, individuals exposed to OxyContin could have experienced mood instability, such as impulsive behavior and/or violent tendencies (Roth, 1994, Jaffe and Jaffe, 1999; Fazel et al., 2006; Moore et al. 2010; Moore et al. 2011), finding suggestive evidence on the fact that individuals in non-triplicate states, suffered from mood instability more frequently than those in triplicate states after the introduction of OxyContin in 1996. Second, the increased opioid consumption could raise crime rates, particularly violent crime, through an increase in alcohol consumption (Markowitz and Grossman, 2000, Carpenter and Dobkin, 2010, Markowitz, 2005, Heaton, 2012; Cook and Durrance 2013; Anderson et al. 2018; Hansen and Waddell 2018). The evidence on the increase in the consumption of alcohol in non-triplicate states after the introduction of OxyContin in 1996 is plausible, but the data are very noisy.====Note that this study does not speak to the potential benefits of OxyContin (or in- creased accessibility to prescription opioids) on the drug users’ health outcomes, such as better pain management. Rather, this paper adds empirical evidence to the extant literature on the effects of stringent prescription monitoring programs on opioid misuse and other social outcomes (Buchmueller and Carey 2018; Mallat 2018; Grecu et al. 2019; Wen et al. 2019; Dave et al., 2021; Evans et al. 2022).==== My findings demonstrate that OxyContin’s introduction played a role in increasing crime rates in states without stringent policies on prescription drugs.",The effect of opioids on crime: Evidence from the introduction of OxyContin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818823000145,28 February 2023,2023,Research Article,6.0

Using an unpublished dataset on deposits held by branches of US banks on a geographically unconsolidated basis, we find that the FATCA led to a reduction in deposits held in branches located in ","The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is the boldest and more powerful US regulatory initiative to fight international tax evasion, giving US regulators extraterritorial oversight over foreign financial institutions. Since its enactment in 2010, these enhanced powers have facilitated the crackdown of a number of tax evasion cases involving US taxpayers through the facilitating role of foreign banks. In 2019, the Department of Justice convicted a former executive of a Belize-based stock brokerage firm who, in an attempt to launder money for an FBI undercover agent posing as a potential US client, was ready and willing to conceal the transaction from US authorities.==== In the context of the largest tax evasion case against a US individual, US lawmakers have also relied on their enhanced powers under the FATCA to press Mirabaud & Cie, a Swiss bank, for information on a case. Following declarations from a whistleblower, the billionaire Robert Brockman, Chairman and CEO of The Reynolds and Reynolds Company, was charged for concealing more than $2 billion of income from the US tax authorities in 2020. The decade-long tax evasion scheme was highly sophisticated, featuring a complex web of shell companies and bank accounts, records tampering and backdating, and encrypted communication. Following the billionaire indictment, federal court records have allowed identifying some of the financial institutions holding undeclared bank accounts, located in Switzerland and Bermuda. Most prominently, Mirabaud & Cie, which under the FATCA should have been sharing information on accounts held by Americans with the US tax authorities, was found to hold around $1 billion in undisclosed deposits on behalf of Mr. Brockman.====The FATCA constitutes a large leap from previous countering tax-evasion policies mainly because of its extraterritorial reach. Indeed, under the FATCA, the fight against offshore tax evasion by US citizens and fiscal residents relies principally on the cooperation of foreign financial institutions (FFIs), who have renewed incentives to disclose information on asset holdings of US taxpayers to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).==== The failure to disclose results in a punitive withholding tax of 30% on US-originating income streams directed to FFIs. Cooperating foreign governments can also benefit from reciprocity in exchange for tax information through the signature of bilateral intergovernmental agreements (IGAs).====While some US and international policymakers have lauded such a bold regulatory initiative, many have expressed severe criticism towards the FATCA. Foreign financial institutions and some foreign governments have been particularly vocal against the FATCA due to the high compliance costs and the lack of a true reciprocal exchange of information from the US side (Eccleston and Gray, 2014). US banks have also raised great concerns. The Bankers Association, in the context of a lawsuit filed over the reporting rules of the FATCA, pointed out that it would lead to a substantial withdrawal of deposits and investments out of US banks in favor of their foreign competitors, impairing US banks’ activities. While the evidence is starting to emerge in the related literature supporting foreigners’ disinvestment in US securities following the FATCA (De Simone et al., 2020, Menkhoff and Miethe, 2019), it is unclear whether it has any adverse effects on US banks themselves. One question that remains unanswered is: What are the FATCA’s implications on US banks, and in particular global banks? Answering this question is of crucial importance for understanding the far-reaching implications of the FATCA and its possible unintended effects on the international financial system. To the extent to which the FATCA will significantly reduce funds held in tax havens via offshore banks, US global banks are expected to be particularly impacted by the Act. A closer look at the geographic distribution of the activities of US banks indeed reveals their important presence in tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, and the Bahamas.====This paper aims to investigate the impact of the FATCA on US global banks by using an unpublished dataset on foreign deposits of foreign branches of US banks obtained from the US regulator. The geographically segmented deposit data of foreign branches of US banks covers 57 jurisdictions, including many tax havens, for the 1990–2017 period. We test for several scenarios that US banks may face following the implementation of the FATCA. First, we investigate whether the enhanced FATCA reporting system adopted by US banks, involving most notably a more thorough investigation of the identification of the ultimate beneficiary of shell companies, has led to an overall decline in deposits held in tax havens. Second, we explore whether branches located in IGA-signing tax havens experience a heightened decline in deposits. A more pronounced flight of US tax evaders’ deposits may be observed in branches located in tax havens that sign an IGA, possibly due to increased pressure in the local banking systems to enhance transparency and due diligence (driven by the compulsory exchange of information system faced by local banks) which increases the probability of detection of tax evaders. Last, we investigate whether US banks engage in the cross-border transfer of US tax-evading deposits held in tax havens to branches located in non-IGA locations. As argued by De Simone et al. (2020), evading taxpayers can circumvent FATCA requirements by moving their hidden assets to non-FATCA signing countries. Here, we provide evidence for whether US banks facilitate this deposit shifting.====Our results point to a significant post-FATCA reduction of deposits held in branches of US banks located in tax havens and in particular in those who have signed an IGA. From interoffice capital flows, we also advance evidence in support of a transfer of deposits from branches located in tax havens signing IGA to branches located in jurisdictions that have not signed an IGA. The post-FATCA decrease in deposits in tax haven locations is an indication of the facilitation of tax evasion by US banks before the implementation of the Act.====This paper relates to the broader strand of literature on the evaluation of regulatory initiatives to counteract tax evasion by households.==== Several papers investigate the effect of international deposits following information exchange treaties threatening bank secrecy in tax havens. As shown in Caruana-Galizia and Caruana-Galizia (2016), Johannesen and Zucman (2014), and O’Donovan et al. (2016), the signature of reciprocal agreements leads to an overall reduction in international deposits. Huizinga and Nicodème (2004), focusing on cross-border deposit flows, suggest that frictions in the system of information sharing hinder the effectiveness of offshore tax evasion policies. Johannesen and Zucman (2014) evaluate the impact of tax treaties aimed at exchanging banking information between G20 countries and tax havens signed in 2009. The authors find a negligible impact on overall deposits held offshore explained by the geographic reallocation of funds to banks located in tax havens with weaker information exchange obligations. Johannesen (2014) focuses on the effect on Swiss bank deposits held by EU households following the 2004 European Saving Directive aimed at collecting the interest income earned by depositors in some tax havens without disclosing the identity of the owner of the deposit account. The author finds a decline of approximately 40% in Swiss deposits made by European households as well as a geographic reallocation of funds to nonparticipating tax havens.====A more recent strand of the literature focuses on the actual implications of the FATCA implementation. De Simone et al. (2020) show that the FATCA has led to a decrease in investment in the US financial market by foreign investors. The authors report a negative post-FACTA impact on foreign holdings of US securities holdings amounting to $78.0 billion. Menkhoff and Miethe (2019) advance evidence in support of the fact that tax havens having entered a bilateral reciprocal FATCA IGA experience a post-regulatory decline in cross-border (outbound) nonbank deposits from the US. A few other scholars have raised the alarm about the increasing number of US citizens’ bank account closures by foreign banks to avoid compliance with the FATCA (Grinberg, 2012, Woldeab, 2015). In the case of nonreciprocal IGAs, Dharmapala (2016) theoretically shows that the FATCA can lead to an increase in charges imposed by compliant FFIs to foreign resident account holders as well as increased levels of cross-border tax evasion.====The paper is organized as follows.

Public enforcement of law relies on the use of public agents, such as judges, to follow the law. We use the random assignment of U.S. Federal judges setting geographically-local precedent to document the causal impact of court decisions in a hierarchical legal system. We examine lower court cases filed before and resolved after higher court decisions and find that lower courts are 29%–37% points more likely to rule in the manner of the higher court. The results obtain when the higher court case was decided in the same doctrinal area as the pending case and when the higher court case was decided on the merits. Reversals by the higher court have no significant effects. These results provide evidence that judges are motivated to follow the law and are not solely motivated by policy preferences.","In recent decades, economists (Miceli and Coşgel, 1994), judges (Posner, 1993), and political scientists (Segal and Spaeth, 1993, Spaeth and Segal, 2001) have speculated on the drivers of judges’ decisions. We investigate whether judges follow the law and if so, why, in the context of the U.S. Federal Courts, where judges have life-tenure and fixed salaries and where tasks are randomly assigned.====The decision-making powers of public agents can have large impacts, yet their pecuniary rewards are only weakly incentivized by design (Epstein et al., 2013). Classical conceptions of judge behavior suggest that following the law is the main driver of judges’ decisions. But a large empirical literature has documented the seeming importance of ideology, uncovering consistent differences in the way judges decide cases, particularly along political lines (Segal and Spaeth, 1993, Sunstein et al., 2006). While this is often interpreted as a “preferentialist” conception of legal decision-making (i.e., judges make decisions to achieve policy outcomes rather than to follow the law), one can argue for alternate interpretations: judges might be following what they perceive to be “the law”, even if differences in their legal philosophies lead them to consistently decide cases differently. For instance, a judge can derive from first principles an adherence to a strict interpretation of the Constitution, while not necessarily hewing to the consequentialist preferences of a political party for a certain policy outcome. Attempts to document the influence of “legal” factors such as the creation of precedent or changes in statutory law on judges’ decisions have remained scarce (Spaeth and Segal, 2001, Cross, 2005, Gilbert, 2011, Fischman, 2015, Helland, 2019, Niblett et al., 2010, Niblett, 2013) and are difficult for several reasons. We propose and implement a methodology that provides clean evidence that judges are motivated to follow the law and are not solely motivated by policy preferences.====The great econometric challenge behind knowing whether judges follow the law is at least five-pronged. In a seminal contribution, Priest and Klein (1984) first pointed out that plaintiffs and defendants bargain under the shadow of the law, so the plaintiff win rate reveals no information about the underlying strength of precedent. This insight effectively ended a research agenda that correlated real outcomes with measures of law to infer the real effects of laws. Second, as all law students are taught, there is extensive cross-fertilization of legal doctrine between different areas of law via analogies. ==== extended the right of privacy under the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause, which was previously interpreted as precluding government interference in ====, but ==== interpreted Due Process as precluding government interference in a ====. With cross-fertilization, real outcomes may be misattributed to one legal rule when many legal rules are changing simultaneously. The conventional approach would be to control for other legal rules, but it is practically infeasible to code–much less select–all the possible related doctrinal areas. Third, in another seminal contribution, Besley and Case (2000) cautioned against causal interpretation of correlations between real outcomes and laws because constituents can influence policies. This concern is a particularly trenchant for court cases (Klarman, 2005), because the legal doctrine often instructs judges to take account of community standards, i.e., norms, so it will be difficult to distinguish between laws causing economic changes and economic changes causing laws. They may even take into account the potential consequences of their decisions–at least some judges on both the left (Breyer, 2006) and right (Posner, 1998) do–which can bias the correlation between future outcomes and today’s decisions if they desire similar consequences while sitting on other cases. We overcome these three challenges with random variation in legal precedent using biographical characteristics of judges: We cannot ask judges to randomize their decisions in the interest of legal science, but the judges themselves are randomly assigned and their background correlates with the way they decide, effectively creating a clinical trial that randomizes jurisprudence.====The fourth challenge in measuring the effects of legal precedent on judicial decisions is the selection of litigation under the shadow of the law ==== a precedent has been issued. Recent theoretical models view courts as continually shifting the legal standard (Gennaioli and Shleifer, 2007). In deciding issues of law, common law courts provide new interpretations of or distinctions within pre-existing precedents or statutes. These new distinctions expand or contract the space under which an actor is found liable. Under these theoretical models, plaintiff win rates imply increasingly favorable laws for the plaintiff. However, under (Priest and Klein, 1984), defendants should be more likely to settle in response. Thus, judges decide on different types of cases before and after a legal precedent, making it challenging to have clean evidence of the effect of law on judicial decision-making. We overcome the fourth challenge by examining the impact of higher court case resolutions on pending lower court cases in the jurisdiction of the higher courts.====The fifth challenge is to find an area of law that occurs with high frequency in both the higher and lower courts and where all lower court filings are observed. Fortunately, the centrality of piercing the corporate veil in U.S. business law allows such an analysis. Piercing the corporate veil has been dubbed the “most litigated issue in corporate law” (Thompson, 1991). It is a legal remedy allowing a creditor of a corporation to hold its shareholders liable for the debt of the corporation. We have obtained all filings where plaintiffs attempt to pierce the corporate veil in the Federal Courts. We investigate the impact of Circuit Court judgments on the decisions of District Court judges and litigants in ongoing proceedings before the District Courts. By linking corporate veil piercing pleadings before the U.S. District Courts with administrative data on District case outcomes and all Circuit Court cases decided while the case was pending, we can examine cases that were initiated before a Circuit decision but were decided after a Circuit decision to control for selection into litigation.====We collect and assemble unique data: piercing the corporate veil decisions in U.S. Circuit Courts, District Court pleadings (using the Westlaw pleadings database), and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts Civil Terminations (AOC) database, which contains information on every case litigated before the U.S. Federal District Courts. This allows us to construct a database of District Court decisions that were filed before, but decided after the appellate decisions were submitted, thereby holding constant the case sample and eliminating any effect of the selection of cases for litigation (Hubbard, 2013). We further solve the issues of reverse causality and omitted variables by instrumenting for the direction of the resolution of the appellate cases using the random assignment of appellate judges. Moreover, the richness of the AOC database allows us to examine the impact of appellate court decisions on the duration of District Court cases. Particularly, it allows us to investigate whether litigants, incorporating the new judicial standard in deciding which litigated cases to bring to trial, are more likely to settle a case after a Circuit Court judgment.====We find a strong relationship between Circuit Court decisions and ensuing District Court decisions. After Circuit Court decisions voting to pierce, District Courts are 29%–37% points more likely to pierce. The effect is observed in the raw data and with the instrumental variables strategy. The effects are due to Circuit decisions litigated in the same area of law as the pending District case and when the Circuit decision reached a judgment on the merits. We observe no increase in settlement after Circuit decisions, suggesting that litigants, a large part of whose litigation costs have already been sunk, are not settling in response to the new decision standard. This suggests that the behavioral changes are due to the judges themselves. Finally, we observe no significant impact of Circuit Court reversals separate from the precedent itself, suggesting that reversal aversion is not the main driver. These results are inconsistent with a purely realist view of judicial decision-making where judges are only motivated by policy preferences.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains information on the institutional background of the U.S. Federal Courts system, piercing the corporate veil, and describes the data. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy. Section 4 discusses the results as well as their implications.

However, compared with non-exposed firms, exposed firms suffered negative repercussions on employment after the enforcement of LCL. Exposed firms exhibited reduced wages after the LCL relative to non-exposed firms, suggesting that wage has a mediation effect on reducing the insurance expenditures of both employers and employees; they also raised productivity considerably after the LCL to absorb the incremental labor costs and survive in the market. However, there are heterogeneous effects of wage and productivity among firms of various ownerships and exporting behaviors.","Apart from the minimum wage (MW) regulation that increases workers’ income and assists workers in receiving an adequate living wage, the welfare package (mainly social insurance) is also crucial for workers. The provision of social insurance promotes labor rights and reduces the potential burden on workers when they become unemployed, require medical treatment, or reach retirement age. Employers must bear a certain proportion of the premium payment based on the individual worker’s wage to provide employees social insurance. The increased labor cost could be substantial, thereby lowering employment demand. However, adequate risk protection may boost labor productivity to mitigate the cost disadvantage.====In 2008, China enacted the Labor Contract Law (LCL), which requires employers to provide five types of insurance and places restrictions on dismissing employees by signing a labor contract (Zheng, 2009). Although the employer contributions to five insurances vary slightly across provinces, particularly endowment insurance, the additional mandatory employer-provided benefits reach at least 30% of wages (Giles et al., 2013). Since 2003, the fast-growing industrial sector has experienced an accelerated increase in real wages, even during slack seasons, heralding the arrival of a labor shortage from a period of labor surplus (Zhang et al., 2011). Because the 2008 LCL regulates the provision of wage-based benefits for all workers, employers must bear the considerable additional expenditure for social insurance contributions, affecting firms’ employment behavior.====As depicted in Fig. 1, the average annual wage of workers in the manufacturing sector increased from RMB 8750 in 2000 to RMB 24,408 in 2008, representing a 13.53% annual growth rate. The average wage increased further to RMB 46,431 in 2013, reaching a slightly higher growth rate (of 14.03%) than in the 2008–2013 period. The cost of insurance provision, which accounts for at least 30% of the total wage bill, significantly contributes to the increased labor cost. However, Fig. 1 shows an increasing trend in industrial employment from 2000 to 2013, implying that the LCL’s implementation appears to have no effect on employment.====In general, stricter labor regulations impede employment, resulting in higher unemployment (Botero et al., 2004, Feldmann, 2009), at least in the formal sector (Nataraj et al., 2014).==== Yaniv (2006) emphasizes that the employment effect of labor regulations depends on adequate enforcement to induce compliance. The 2008 LCL enforced the employer provision on social insurance, regulated contract termination, and other provisions. It strictly monitored scheme implementation and imposed penalties for noncompliance. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) definition of the strictness of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL), China’s LCL is stricter than most OECD countries (Park et al. 2012). Thus, this regulation has a greater and more direct impact on employment than MW reform, which is based on the Kaitz index, the ratio of the MW to the average wage.==== If labor regulations cause unemployment, their conception of strengthening worker rights and benefits would come at the expense of unemployment. Therefore, examining the employment effect of labor regulations is critical that inspires the primary concern of this study: whether and how the stringent labor regulation, LCL, influences firm employment in China? The new law’s exogenous nature provided the setting for a quasi-natural experiment.====Although the LCL has significant employment effect, studies are scarce and unresolved issues remain. For instance, Park et al. (2012) use manufacturing firms in 2009 to analyze the impact of the 2008 LCL on the employment of production workers. Because the LCL was laxly enforced in 2009 before becoming strictly enforced in late 2010 (Qian et al., 2014), the analysis cannot identify this employment impact during this sample period. Ma and Cheng (2020) examined the issue by conducting a small sample of firm surveys in two provinces from 2014 to 2016, excluding the pre-reform period, and assessing the treatment effect of the LCL. The present study examines how the strict enforcement of the LCL influences employment in Chinese firms using nationwide representative firm-level data from 2005 to 2007 and 2011–2013. In particular, whether firms were subject to this LCL regulation in the pre-LCL periods is taken into account, because competitive firms can decide whether to comply with labor regulations in the absence of a strictly enforced law (Yaniv, 2006). Therefore, the LCL regulation is important for “exposed” firms rather than “non-exposed” firms.====The LCL might execute heterogeneous employment effects across firms with distinct characteristics. In China, ownership and exporting are two key dimensions that distinguish firm behavior and performance. Even though China’s economy has shifted from a socialist to a market-based system, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to play a key role in the manufacturing sector. SOEs generally shoulder some social objectives and retain socialistic thinking; they tend to comply with the labor market regulations, despite increased costs due to soft budget constraints (Dong and Putterman, 2003). Most foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) in China originate from East Asian countries, Europe, and the US, and they have superior technologies and management knowledge. They are thought to be more capable of bearing the incremental labor costs caused by the LCL and are more likely to respond to institutional pressure in the host country, thereby mitigating the unexpected difficulties from the local bureaucratic administration.====In the 2000 s, export expansion was a key strategy for promoting economic growth in China. For example, commodity exports accounted for 24.51% of industrial output in 2006 and 28.87% in 2010. Encouraged by the policy measure, many low-productivity firms participate in the global production chain and enter the international market through processing export (Yu, 2015), which requires more labor-intensive production. Therefore, the wage elasticity of labor demand in exporters may be higher, implying that incremental labor costs are more relevant to exporters. Gan et al. (2016) also found that rising labor costs negatively correlate with firm exports, with a non-negligible decrease in both export decision and value in the 2000 s. The present study aims to investigate whether the employment effect of the 2008 LCL varies between exporters and non-exporters.====Although the LCL regulation may harm employment, this impact may be mitigated through wage negotiation between employers and employees. Under the LCL rule, workers must contribute co-payments that account for more than 10% of their total wages, resulting in a lower net salary. This may encourage vulnerable groups (youth and low-skilled labor) to bargain with their employers for a package that includes “a lower nominal wage plus bonus,” which benefits both parties. Moreover, firms generally strive to increase productivity to cope with labor cost shocks and survive in a difficult business environment (Mayeris et al., 2018). These endogenous wage and productivity mitigation effects are also evaluated to obtain robust results.====The study analyzes how the implementation of the 2008 LCL affects firm employment in China from a legal and economic standpoint, and it adds to the literature in several ways. First, the policy in question is relevant not only to other developing or low-income economies, but also to reforms and trade-offs central to the early evolution of welfare states in high-income countries. Second, it examines the employment impact of a more holistic labor market regulation than the MW regulation, allowing for a better understanding of the policy impact of non-wage labor regulation on a labor market. Third, we explore the possible heterogeneous effects of the LCL across firms based on ownership and exporting status. Fourth, the accompanying mediation effects of wages and productivity promotion under strict labor regulations are analyzed. Results are then obtained using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, based on large firm-level panel data, to demonstrate the effects of implementing the 2008 LCL.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the 2008 LCL and provides some information on employer-provided social insurance in the years preceding 2008. A review of the related literature is also provided in this section. Section 3 introduces the firm-level panel dataset and empirical strategy used in this study. Section 4 summarizes and discusses the estimation results. Section 5 describes additional analyses and robustness checks.

We employ the reform as an exogenous shock to examine the effect of political influence on ==== in the state-dominated economy. We first develop a hazard model of firms’ responses to the reform and use the predicted hazard rate as a proxy for a firm’s ==== political influence. We find a positive correlation between firm valuation changes and the predicted hazard rate in the events of party-building reform announcements and a consistent long-term valuation effect based on the difference-in-differences analyses. We also find that the market reacts negatively when firms elect to adopt charter provisions that allow the CCP to control their personnel decisions. Together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of party-building reform on a firm’s valuation depends on the trade-off between the benefits from the increased state capture and the costs of state influence in firm ==== and that the enhanced political control costs are mitigated for firms with stronger existing political ties. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing a novel and integrated approach to measuring political influence that goes beyond the traditional state ownership measurement and by identifying ==== political influence as an important factor in ====.","Extensive literature documents that political influence on firm decision making can harm corporate governance and firm valuation. Most theoretical arguments point to the adverse effect of politicians’ use of firm resources for political and social ends (e.g., boosting employment, rectifying market failures, and reducing income inequality) rather than maximizing shareholder value (Shleifer and Vishny, 1994, Boycko et al., 1996, Bai et al., 2000, Clarke, 2003, Bai et al., 2006, Qu and Wu, 2014, Clarke, 2016). The adverse effect of political influence can be significant for both firm performance and economic development, as entrepreneurship can wither and economies stagnate under the excessive influence of the state (Shleifer and Vishny, 1998). The aim of this study is to investigate how the consequences of political influence affect firm valuation in China, an economy where the state’s authority is dominant and pervasive.====How do we measure the degree of a state’s political influence on a firm in a state capitalism context such as China? Many studies have focused on state ownership as the predominant measure of political influence and have treated the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as the representatives of Chinese state capitalism. In contrast, Milhaupt and Zheng (2015) argue that as the Chinese government maintains its deciding commands on granting direct subsidies, favorable loan terms, and safeguards for selected economic sectors, many successful Chinese privately-owned enterprises (POEs) – those with minimal state ownership on the book – can also have close state connections and heavy political influence in place (Li et al., 2008, Zhou, 2009, Chow et al., 2012, Milhaupt and Zheng, 2015).====If one accepts this argument, studies on the state’s political influence based solely on either a contrast between SOEs and POEs or an examination of state ownership can be subject to “ownership bias” (Milhaupt and Zheng, 2015) as well as incomplete regarding Chinese firms. Our study exploits a recent major reform in China, the ====, or a party-building initiative, that aimed to strengthen party-state control of firms by formalizing the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) power and role in corporate governance. We use party-building as an exogenous shock to the state’s political influence to address three research questions. First, we consider the breadth of state control by creating a novel measure of the degree of the state’s political influence, which goes beyond the traditional SOE/POE dichotomy or state shareholding. Our measure is developed based on a ==== sample of Chinese firms with a comprehensive set of firm characteristics (in addition to state ownership). Second, we investigate how corporate valuation responds to this shock of political influence in this state-dominated economy. Third, we develop and test the hypothesis that the cross-sectional variation of firm valuation in response to party-building can be captured by the costs of the suboptimal governance imposed by the reform.====Since 2015, the CCP has implemented the party-building reform to solidify its control of Chinese SOEs. The reform consolidates the legal position of party cells in SOEs and the state’s role in corporate governance. Although it is primarily targeted at SOEs, some POEs have also responded to the call for reform. Of the 902 firms that amended relevant charter provisions during our sample period, 289 are controlled by the Chinese central government (central SOEs), 505 by local governments (local SOEs), and 108 by private shareholders (POEs). The response of our sample firms to the party-building reform is consistent with the view in the existing literature that businesses operating in China, whether SOEs or not, stay close to the Chinese party-state and are susceptible to political influence (Milhaupt and Zheng, 2015).====We first develop a new approach to measuring political influence in China, going beyond less precise measures of political influence, such as the SOE/POE dichotomy or the share of direct state ownership (Xie et al., 2022). We examine firms’ responses to the party-building reform to evaluate the level of the state’s political influence firms currently experience. We infer this influence by conducting a hazard (duration) analysis using the number of days as the dependent variable between September 13, 2015 (the date of the initial announcement of party-building reform) and the date on which the shareholder’s meeting passed the inclusion of the party-building provisions in its corporate charter. Our hazard analysis includes a comprehensive set of firm ownership and financial characteristics as the covariates, with the underlying construct that a firm with more significant state influence is more likely to embrace the party-building reform and to do so more promptly. Our analysis indicates that firm size and state ownership strongly relate to a higher hazard rate of party-building adoption, while POEs are strongly correlated with a lower hazard rate. Interestingly, firms with cross-listed shares on the Hong Kong market, in lower tiers of corporate pyramids, or both are associated with a lower hazard rate of adoption. While prior literature only examines the hazard rate of adoption among SOEs (Liu and Zhang 2019), our hazard analysis, which covers non-SOEs’ adoption of party-building provisions, is more comprehensive. Our model’s predicted hazard rate of party-building adoption is then used to measure a firm’s political influence by the state before the adoption (==== political influence).====While existing literature examines the firm characteristics of adopting firms, factors determining a firm’s acceptance of party control, and the voting reactions of foreign investors, very few studies examine the valuation effect of party-building adoption and the resulting enhanced political control (Liu and Zhang 2019, Lin and Milhaupt, 2021, Lin, 2021, Xie et al., 2022). Thus, we investigate investors’ reactions to the announcements of the reform policies over time and evaluate how this shock affects the valuation of Chinese listed firms. Consistent with our hypothesis that investors value the change in political influence as a trade-off between benefits of state capture==== and costs of state-supervised governance, we uncover a positive firm valuation change concentrated among firms in the quartiles of a higher predicted hazard rate of party-building adoption, a proxy for ==== political influence. We report the investors’ reactions to two critical events in the policy announcements: October 12, 2016, when President Xi publicly endorsed the policy of formalizing the CCP’s role in the current corporate governance structure, and January 3, 2017, when the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council issued guidelines on the party-building provisions for the first time. For the second event, when the investors perceived a more specific path of the reform, we report a positive and significant correlation between the three- and five-day cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and the fourth quartile (highest) of the predicted hazard rate indicator. This positive correlation tapers off in the third and second quartiles.====Our analysis is further distinguished from existing literature by extending to the eventual adoption announced by boards of directors and examining investor reactions to the details of the charter provisions across adopting firms (Xie et al., 2022). For the 902 adopting firms, we conducted a regression analysis of the three- and five-day CARs on each of the 10 provision indicators and of the aggregate indexes of three categories of provisions after controlling for other firm characteristics as well as industry and province fixed effects. We report a negative and significant coefficient of the personnel-related index as well as of Provision 8 (the party cadre management principle in which the party can appoint managers and directors). The negative market response to the personnel provisions indicates that allowing the CCP to control a firm’s personnel imposes high incremental costs and negatively impacts firm value.====Lastly, we conduct a difference-in-differences analysis comparing the Tobin’s Q of the adopters with that of non-adopting control firms matched by the predicted hazard rates, and we report a positive longer-term valuation effect. The interaction term of adopters and post-adoption indicators is positively significant at the 1% level. The finding confirms the positive investor reaction to the adopters, with the benefits of state capture outweighing the costs of state-supervised governance after the reform. Our results are robust to including industry and time fixed effects, and our difference-in-differences design is valid in the falsification test.====Our study makes several contributions to the literature. First, it advances the understanding of how to evaluate a state’s political influence on firms, which is often not directly observable. Existing research has used either an SOE/POE indicator, state ownership, or a corporate director’s affiliation with the party-state as a proxy for political influence, pointing to the possible sources of political influence rather than directly observing firms’ action to the level of political influence (Liu and Zhang 2019, Lin and Milhaupt, 2021, Xie et al., 2022). Our study offers an approach whereby political influence can be directly measured based on a firm’s response to the party-state’s demand for additional control. Consistent with the results of Milhaupt and Zheng (2015), our results confirm that Chinese POEs are not entirely politically independent and that the extent of political influence on a Chinese firm ==== from either an SOE/POE indicator or direct state ownership.====Second, our study extends the literature regarding how changes in political influence in a state-directed economy affect a firm’s valuation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use a plausible and exogenous shock in examining the valuation effect of the state’s political influence on a ==== sample of Chinese firms. We report a positive correlation between corporate valuation change and ==== political influence on firms. For a heavily politically influenced firm with tight control from state-related shareholders to begin with, the benefits from additional party-state support usually outweigh the incremental costs from increased party-state control. This contrasts with a firm that is less intertwined with the state (with a low predicted adoption hazard rate). For this type of firm, the benefits from increased state capture are mostly offset by the costs of prioritizing social or political objectives, which are likely in conflict with shareholder interests. We also document that the market reacts ==== when firms elect to adopt charter provisions allowing the party to intervene in personnel decisions. Overall, our evidence supports the hypothesis that investors value the change in political influence as a trade-off between the benefits of state capture and the costs of state-supervised governance, with the enhanced political control costs mitigated for firms with stronger existing political ties.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the party-building event, discusses related research, and introduces our hypotheses. Section 3 presents the data collection and summary statistics.

In many countries around the world, the legality of the online poker ","Poker is one of the most popular card games worldwide, and the question of its legal status poses itself in similar terms in many jurisdictions around the globe. Millions of players play the game every day for real money, either physically or online, representing a multi-billion dollar industry with its class of superstar players, specialized magazines, TV channels, websites, forums and dedicated international competitions (e.g., the World Series of Poker). In an attempt to put the game on par with traditional sports, its proponents have argued that poker should be considered a “mind sport” alongside chess, bridge or Go.====Whether or not poker formally qualifies as a (mind) sport, its trajectory as an industry is not unlike that of “e-sports” (Hallmann and Giel, 2018). The advent of the Internet has spurred a genuine boom in both interest (demand side) and practice (offer side). This, in turn, has given rise to a self-sustained class of professional players (McCormack and Griffiths, 2012, Meng-Lewis et al., 2021), suggesting an important role for skill in the game involving a subtle combination of mathematical ability, self-control and strategic thinking. Similar to e-sports, the current practice of (online) poker can therefore be seen as a manifestation of “sportification” (Heere, 2018). The concept of sportification refers to the idea that some activities that may not be considered a “sport” at first glance (e.g., because of a lack of physicality) may still be analyzed and organized as such, notably when they are played competitively and followed by a large audience. In theory, this should imply a scientifically-informed conversation around how to best organize this activity so that it resembles a sport by allowing a fair, pleasurable, and safe environment for individuals to compete and compare their performance over time.====From a legal perspective, however, the debate around the sportification of online poker never made it to the above regulatory issues, as it stumbles upon a more basic issue: that of it is very legality. The legal question of interest here is that of whether online poker can be distinguished from a game of chance – i.e., online gambling. Indeed, in many legal systems, gambling activities are either prohibited altogether, or fall under a highly supervised legal regime (e.g., state ownership or indirect control via a concession).==== However obvious it may have appeared to the game’s practitioners, the question of whether online poker should be legally considered a game of skill thus emerged as a high stake economic one.====In the U.S., a number of courts arrived at the conclusion that because it was “dominated by chance”, online poker should be legally equated to online gambling. The notion of “skill dominance” has not been precisely defined by judges, however, so that we can only speculate as to their underlying mental model by looking at their actual decisions. In a detailed account of the legal debate around this issue, Miles et al. (2013) document how courts ruled in a methodological vacuum that may have precisely resulted from the ambiguity of the concept of skill dominance. Neither did judges seek to define skill in the context of the game, nor did they try to come-up with a methodology to assess its role in determining player performance. Among other examples, decisions of a similar nature have been observed in India – an emerging but fast growing market for online poker – where several high courts have rules in the same direction (Sayta, 2012).====The legal consequences were fierce for the American online poker industry as it fell under the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). In 2011, the three most important online poker platforms (PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker) were indicted on charges of bank fraud, money laundering, and illegal gambling. Their domain names were seized, restraining orders were issued against dozens of bank accounts in the U.S., and the Department of Justice sought over $3 billion in penalties and forfeitures (it eventually settled for over $700 million).====In sharp contrast to this legal assessment, the scientific literature which emerged in parallel has largely converged to the conclusion that (online) poker was a game of skill.==== Interestingly, almost none of these papers operationalized the “skill dominance” criterion put forth by judges in terms of whether skill “dominated” luck in determining overall game outcomes. Instead, researchers set out to test whether differences in skill between players were “significant”, i.e., whether said differences were large enough to enable sizeable differences in performance and profits over time. Croson et al. (2008) collected data on high-profile poker and golf tournament rankings over several years. They found that players’ yearly rankings are persistent over the years, and that this persistence is as strong in poker as it is in golf – a game thought to be primarily skill-based. Miles et al. (2013) discussed the issue of skill measurement from a legal perspective and relied on online poker data to show that (i) players differ in their profitability and (ii) their returns tend to be correlated over time. Levitt and Miles (2014) showed that players identified ==== as being highly skilled (e.g., because they were top money winners in a previous tournament or appeared in one of the published lists of the best contemporary players) achieve an average return on investment of over 30 percent in the World Series of Poker, compared to −15 percent for all the other players. van Loon et al. (2015) relied on online poker data to show that players who rank in the top (respectively, bottom) decile of earnings in the first half of their sample period (covering 12 consecutive months) are substantially more likely to end up in the top (respectively, bottom) performance decile in the second half. More recently, Duersch et al. (2020) have nuanced the above literature by pointing out that while the case for skill in poker appears indisputable, this does not necessarily imply that game outcomes are ==== determined by skill. Based on a comparison with the game of chess, the authors conclude that online poker outcomes are, in fact, predominantly determined by chance.====In this paper, we argue that the skill dominance criterion understood as “does skill dominate game outcomes” can be highly misleading when it comes to making a legal distinction between gambling and skill-based activities. The reason is straightforward. It puts uncertain decision making environments at a disadvantage in the examination process, as the criterion requires them to pass some arbitrary cutoff in terms of how much of individual outcomes can effectively be attributed to differences in skill. Such an approach represents a significant departure from the way skill has been traditionally characterized across industries in the literature. In many industries, skilled decision making is typically made under stringent conditions of uncertainty that make it virtually impossible for any individual player to “control” the majority of market outcomes. This is why “skill dominance” in such environments is usually defined with respect to the question of whether differences in skill can be detected across players that generate consistent profits. In other words, the criterion asks: “do skilled players dominate the game?”====As a field example, consider the global market for CEOs. Most researchers would not contend with the fact that players in this industry are engaged in a highly competitive game of skill (Gabaix and Landier, 2008). Superior leadership abilities can lead to efficiency gains, visionary strategic decisions and improved employee motivation, all of which creates significant value. At the same time, empirical research has shown that corporate performance as a whole (and, hence, CEO compensation) may be largely determined by random factors (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2001). As another case in point, consider the example of stock trading. The empirical literature in economics has long recognized that the overwhelming majority of individual investors do not show evidence of skill in stock picking (Barber and Odean, 2000, Barber and Odean, 2013). On average, the performance of those investors is effectively as good as (and sometimes even worse than) random. Does that imply that individual stock trading should be considered a game of chance — akin to online gambling? Such a position would ignore the fact that skill in stock picking does allow a small number of elite investors in the population to consistently beat the market (Akepanidtaworn et al., 2022).====This paper illustrates those ideas by assembling a novel dataset from comprehensive first-hand play records shared by the first, dominant online poker platform in India.==== One unprecedented feature of our data is that we can track the decisions and outcomes of ==== No Limit Hold’em players playing for real money from the inception of the platform in January 2015, and up to May 2018 — including the decision to stop playing altogether (i.e., exit decisions). All in all, our dataset includes 91,439 players whom we follow during a period of 3 years and 4 months (representing over 85 million hands played).====Specifically, we use this data to make two distinct contributions to the literature. Our first contribution is to clarify the legal debate around the ambiguous concept of “skill dominance” put forward by courts in order to legally distinguish games of chance from skill-based activities. We do this both conceptually and empirically. At the conceptual level, we distinguish between two possible interpretations of the concept, understood either as (i) “does skill dominate game outcomes”, or as (ii) “do skilled players dominate the game”. Both interpretations may very well lead to opposite conclusions, as the former has a (questionable) mechanical tendency to treat uncertain fields less favorably. In practice, we argue that the skill dominance criterion might be better framed empirically as “do skilled players dominate the game” than as “does skill dominate game outcomes”. Defined in such a way, the concept does not depend on the level of uncertainty in the environment considered and remains consistent with the way skill is usually characterized in other decision making fields.====We derive the empirical consequences of this legal distinction by developing a simple framework in which both interpretations can be tested independently. Specifically, we use a fixed effect regression to show that (i) skill in our population of players “only” explains about 17.2% of the variance in hand-level outcomes, while (ii) our model is able to reject the hypothesis that skill does not drive player performance with as little as 7 hands of play history. Depending on the selected cutoff for skill dominance, our results illustrate that both tests may indeed lead to contradictory legal conclusions.====Second, we contribute to the advancement of our knowledge on skill dominance in online poker by being the first to work with simple but ==== measures of skill in the game. While the extant literature has built a convincing case for skill in poker based on indirect evidence (such as player-level persistence in tournament rankings), working with such measures allows us to provide direct evidence on how skillful play impacts individual earnings. It further allows us to describe the skill acquisition process in the population of players. This, in turns, provides the analyst with a simple tool that can be used to understand the game’s ecosystem, and draw a less abstract picture of how skill relates to individual results. Specifically, we identify three basic skills that matter for player performance: (i) self-control, (ii) an ability to take (calculated) risk, and (iii) good probability calculation and hand selection.====In a final step to our analysis, we leverage the above skill variables to describe the game’s learning ecosystem. Learning within the population of players can take one of two forms: (i) within-player learning, where players improve their skill level as they become more experienced with the game, and (ii) between-player learning, where some players realize that they are less able than others and thus selectively drop-out of the platform as a function of ability. Empirically however, any trend in playing style according to experience will reflect the combination of both effects. We therefore propose a simple model aimed at separating them out.====This above test is of interest to the analyst, as is indicative of a well-functioning competitive environment. Intuitively, gifted players should be more likely to pursue training and improve their skills, while less-able ones should be more likely to stop playing altogether. If learning does not occur along one or the other dimension, this might raise a red flag for the regulator. The game might be rigged (e.g., some players are acting on private information), or losing players might get severely addicted to it. We find that learning occurs at a significant rate across both dimensions: players quit playing poker as a function of starting ability, and surviving players learn to improve their skills as they play more hands. A lower bound estimate suggests that it takes at least 7 months of full-time training for a novice to acquire the basic skills exhibited by the most experienced players in our data.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. We provide some general background on the game of poker and derive our main skill constructs of interest in Section 2. We present our dataset and variables in Section 3 and develop our identification strategy in Section 4. We report our empirical results in Section 5, where we perform our skill dominance tests, document the impact of skill on player-level performance, and describe the online poker learning ecosystem. We discuss the legal implications of our results in Section 6.",The dominance of skill in online poker,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000758,14 December 2022,2022,Research Article,11.0

We argue that core theory enhances Coase’s transaction cost approach by injecting considerations of coalition formation and stability into the analysis. Analysis of coalitional stability also provides additional insights regarding the nature of transaction costs and the efficiency of institutional arrangements when there are such costs. Overcoming the empty core is potentially an important function of contracts, institutions, and property rights. Empty cores complement transaction costs in rationalizing real-world institutional arrangements.","The Coase Theorem was first articulated in Coase’s (1960) “Nature of Social Cost” and is reputed to be the most highly cited publication in the field of economics. If for no other reason than that, the debate concerning his theorem deserves attention.==== The Coase Theorem maintains that in a world of zero transactions costs, resources will be allocated efficiently, independently of initial property rights assignments, because interested parties will find it in their interest to bargain around property rights assignments that militate against efficiency. In addition to zero transaction costs and no wealth effects, the theorem also assumes that except for formulating potential initial property rights, such as the right to pollute or the right not to pollute, the courts do not intervene in the subsequent bargaining process. In particular, the courts do not prescribe the bargaining process that leads to efficiency. For if the courts are allowed to intervene in the bargaining process, they could also prevent bargaining altogether, in which case the Coase Theorem fails to hold. Instead, interested parties are assumed free to reach any agreement that they find to be of mutual interest.====Aivazian and Callen (1981) (hereinafter A-C) provide a counterexample to the Coase Theorem. In their example, efficiency obtains under one set of property rights without the need to bargain. Under the alternative set of property rights, efficiency requires bargaining (recontracting) but because the core of the game is empty, efficiency cannot be guaranteed.==== In short, the efficient allocation of resources is not independent of the initial property rights assignment, thereby violating both Coasian neutrality and efficiency.====Both in his original paper and in his response to A-C, Coase, 1960, Coase, 1981 emphasizes that a zero transactions cost environment is of little interest per se but rather represents a baseline from which to rationalize institutional arrangements when transactions costs do matter. Although A-C (1981, 2003) fundamentally agree with this point of view, they also maintain that a core theoretic analysis that abstracts from transaction costs is useful in its own right in rationalizing real-world institutions. With an empty core, institutional arrangements will arise to eliminate situations with bargaining instability and cycling that prevent an efficient solution. Pareto optimality can be achieved when the core is empty by the imposition of constraints on the bargaining process. Considerations of coalitional stability shed further light on the nature of transaction costs when there are more than two agents. As we discuss in Sections 4 and 5, a core theoretic analysis that abstracts from transaction costs provides a good benchmark for analyzing situations with transaction costs. Thus, the empty core should not be subsumed under transaction costs as it provides additional insights in the presence of transaction costs. Ultimately, the empty core example shows that the nature of the bargaining process and the stability of coalitions matter in rationalizing institutions.====Coase’s (1981) reply to A-C appears to have convinced some scholars as evidenced by the fact that the latter continue to write about the Coase theorem but are silent about the A-C counterexample even when it is salient to their analysis. In contrast, other scholars have commented either directly or indirectly on the A-C counterexample, primarily, but not exclusively, in an effort to limit the applicability of the counterexample or to deny the counterexample entirely. A few papers have even picked up on the A-C argument that the empty core rationalizes institutional arrangements independently of transactions costs. The purpose of this paper is to critically review papers that have engaged the A-C counterexample and found it wanting. The essential thrust of this review is to argue that the various criticisms in the literature to the A-C counterexample, including Coase’s (1981), fail to do justice to the A-C counterexample --as a number of scholars have noted-- and fail to appreciate its importance to institutional economics and law and economics.==== In addition, this study briefly generalizes the empty core argument to the more recent game-theoretic concept of the farsighted core.====In what follows, Section 2 reviews the original empty-core counterexample without transaction costs. Section 3 discusses Coase’s reply. Section 4 reformulates the original A-C model to include transaction costs. Section 5 contrasts transactions cost and the empty core explanations of contractual and institutional arrangements and shows that these explanations are ultimately complementary. Section 6 reviews the subsequent literature on the empty-core argument and the suggested modifications and criticisms of the argument. Section 7 discusses the nature of some of the underlying factors that increase the likelihood of an empty core, especially non-convexities in production, and related evidence.

For minor/major crimes where the pure rent-seeking enforcement is too strict/weak, the democratic process that provides disciplining incentives (e.g., lower discount rates, higher political rents, and fewer forgone collected fines the government must give up in exchange for reelection) makes the rent-seeking government weaken/strengthen enforcement. However, such discipline can still be insufficient and cause inefficient consequences. Additionally, for intermediate crimes, the democratic process can lead to the government’s inefficient pandering to voters and cause welfare deterioration, even compared to the pure rent-seeking enforcement case. The result shows that different types of distortions happen from previous studies when we consider the conflict between the rent-seeking government and citizens.","The general public delegates policy-making to politicians in the government, but they do not always have the same motivations. Similarly, while citizens delegate the law enforcement task to the government as executives of public law enforcement, the government may use this power in ways that are not consistent with the interests of the electorate. In this respect, as traditional public choice literature, e.g., Brennan and Buchanan (1980), has indicated that public officials tend to pursue budget maximization, it also is important to consider the profit motivation of policing of public law enforcers. The presence of profit-motivated law enforcers has been widely discussed in the law and economics literature. Law enforcement is an important source of revenue for many local governments (Baicker and Jacobson, 2007). For example, Makowsky and Stratmann (2011) use municipal budgetary shortfalls as an instrumental variable to identify the effect of traffic citations on traffic safety and show that budgetary shortfalls lead to more frequent issuances of tickets to drivers. Makowsky et al. (2019) also discuss profit-motivated law enforcers by exploring local deficits and state-level differences in police revenue retention from civil asset forfeitures and find that local fine and forfeiture revenue increases at a faster rate with drug arrests punished with fines than with arrests for violent crimes punished with nonmonetary sanctions, which can differ among black, Hispanic, and white citizens.==== This discussion has common ideas for the concept of a rent-seeking government as originally proposed by Buchanan (1980) and Tullock (1967). While they propose the concept of rent-seeking in a regulatory/special interest group context, this has similarities to law enforcement literature in that the abuse of state monopolistic power in modern democratic institutions to obtain special privileges causes social costs rather than social benefits at the expense of the general public’s beneficial gains. Thus, we consider this profit-driven behavior of law enforcers as “rent-seeking” behavior.====Under the possibility that the profit-driven motivation of public enforcers may distort law enforcement, citizens can resort to the electoral process with voting pressure to discipline them and enhance the interests of the general public (Lenz, 2012, Oliver and Ha, 2007, Burnett and Kogan, 2017). The characteristic features of the modern democratic voting process are no full commitment and enforceability of electoral promises, as Barro (1973), Ferejohn (1986), and Persson and Tabellini (2000) indicated. Thus, (incumbent) politicians and governments have complete discretion once in office, and all citizens can do is punish their bad performances and oust them from office at the next election. That is, while the short-run incentive makes the (incumbent) rent-seeking government choose opportunistic behaviors with the possibility to be rejected in the next elections, the desire to be reelected for future political office rents may induce the government to pander to citizens’ interests, which indicates the importance of the interplay in the electoral process between disciplining incentives for future reelection rents and incentives for opportunistic behavior in the present.==== Makowsky and Stratmann (2009) analyze the determinants of speeding tickets and indicate that police officers, as agents of elected officials, care about not only their local government’s fiscal condition but also the drivers’ ability to vote in local elections (e.g., voter satisfaction), which suggests that police officers engage in their activities to disproportionately raise revenues from nonvoters more than from local voting citizens.====To evaluate the effects of delegated rent-seeking law enforcers from normative viewpoints, we extend the standard law enforcement model, e.g., Becker (1968), Garoupa (1997a), and Polinsky and Shavell (2000). Then, we investigate how political accountability with voting pressure by citizens affects rent-seeking behaviors of profit-driven law enforcers by focusing on the interplay between disciplining incentives for future reelection rents and incentives for opportunistic behavior in the present. First, we consider the rent-seeking enforcer that pursues the collection of fine revenues without concern for harm reduction, following the basic framework in Garoupa and Klerman (2002). Furthermore, by incorporating the essence of the dynamic elections setting into the law enforcement model, the (incumbent) enforcer also has the motivation to be reelected for future rewards, including rents from collected fine revenues and holding office with a privileged position. This dynamic election follows the retrospective voting model proposed by Barro (1973) and Ferejohn (1986) and provides important insights into how the general public can incentivize law enforcers by providing future rewards to take actions beneficial for them and sanctioning rent-seeking performance with rejection in the next election. The electoral process may mitigate conflicts of interest. This can be related to agency problems, although we do not consider asymmetric information as in the usual principal–agent problems (i.e., moral hazards).====We show that, in the case of no political accountability as a benchmark, the enforcer purely pursues maximizing collected fine revenues and chooses overly strict enforcement for crimes with less negative externality (minor crimes) and overly weak enforcement for crimes with severe negative externality (major crimes) compared to a social welfare-maximizing enforcement level, which is similar to the results of Garoupa and Klerman (2002). This is because the rent-seeking government chooses the preferred policies without concern for externalities, even though social welfare requires more severe enforcement as negative externalities worsen. This corresponds to the short-run and opportunistic incentive of the rent-seeking enforcer without considering the desire to be reelected for political office rents.====This can be different if the enforcer responds to political accountability with voting pressure and cares about the disciplining incentives for future reelection rents (e.g., lower holding office rents, higher future discount rates, and more forgone collected fines the enforcer must give up in exchange for reelection) under the democratic process. In the case of crimes with small negative externalities, while pure rent-seeking law enforcement can be strict, the majority of citizens (i.e., potential offenders) who care about their punishment costs, enforcement costs, and harm reduction prefer weak enforcement, which indicates that the disciplining incentives make the enforcer weaken enforcement to pander to the majority. This can provide positive welfare effects, especially for externalities that are too small, where pure rent-seeking enforcement causes unnecessary overenforcement. However, it can still be inefficiently strict if the enforcer does not evaluate future reelection rents and disciplining incentives. Furthermore, as the negative externalities of offenses become nonnegligible (i.e., intermediate), the law enforcement representing only the majority’s interests becomes inefficiently weak compared to the socially efficient level considering both offenders’ and law-abiding citizens’ utility. Especially if the enforcer has more disciplining incentives, this underenforcement is likely to happen. In the case of crimes with a large negative externality, while pure fine revenue-maximizing law enforcement can be weak, the majority of citizens (i.e., law-abiding citizens) who care about both harm reduction and enforcement costs prefer strict enforcement, indicating that the disciplining incentives make the enforcer strengthen enforcement to pander to the majority. This can provide positive welfare effects as the externality becomes too severe when pure rent-seeking enforcement causes underenforcement. However, it can still be inefficiently weak when citizens cannot completely discipline the enforcer’s opportunistic behavior if the enforcer does not evaluate future reelection benefits. Furthermore, even if the majority can discipline the enforcer, considering only the majority’s interests leads to unnecessarily strict enforcement, especially for relatively large (i.e., intermediate) offense externalities compared to the social welfare-maximizing level. If the enforcer has more disciplining incentives, this overenforcement is likely to happen.====In summary, these results indicate that the presence of political accountability can provide opportunities to discipline the rent-seeking law enforcer and have several welfare implications. Providing disciplining incentives can prevent opportunistic behaviors in the present and make the enforcer respond to the majority’s interests. In particular, political accountability has positive welfare impacts when rent-seeking law enforcement without political accountability is strict for too small a negative externality or weak for too large a negative externality. However, if the disciplining incentives are weak because of lower reelection motivations, it is still strict for small negative externalities and weak for large negative externalities. Furthermore, electoral accountability provides opportunities for the majority to follow their demands for crimes with intermediate negative externalities, which is not always consistent with efficiency and worsens social welfare compared to pure rent-seeking law enforcement without political accountability.====We contribute to the literature on rent-seeking law enforcers, e.g., Friedman (1999), Dittmann (2006), Yahagi (2018), Rajabiun (2009), Polinsky (1980), Besanko and Spulber (1989), Garoupa (1997b), and Cooter and Garoupa (2014).==== With a similar motivation, Garoupa and Klerman (2002) consider the fine revenue-maximizing government. We extend their approach to consider how political accountability can mitigate the conflict between rent-seeking enforcers and citizens. Our results indicate that rent-seeking enforcers can respond to the interests of citizens, as empirically shown by Makowsky and Stratmann, 2009, Makowsky and Stratmann, 2011, and provide several welfare implications. Some papers consider political competition in the law enforcement-making process, e.g., Langlais and Obidzinski (2017), Mungan (2017), Friehe and Mungan (2021), Obidzinski (2019) and Yahagi (2021). In particular, Langlais and Obidzinski (2017) consider another voting process that follows the Downsian model (Downs, 1957) in which potential law enforcers (e.g., political candidates) commit to policies ahead of elections and have only a motivation to win elections. In contrast to their approach, we employ a different approach, called a retrospective voting model and proposed by Barro (1973) and Ferejohn (1986), and assume the presence of profit-driven law enforcers. The retrospective voting model has the following characteristic features. While the Downsian model assumes the enforceability and commitment assumption of electoral promise, the retrospective voting model drops these assumptions, which indicates that the political constitution is viewed as an incomplete contract where (incumbent) politicians have complete discretion once in office and all citizens can do is punish their bad performances and oust them from the office at the next election. Then, the central tension is between policies that please citizens and rents appropriated by politicians (Persson and Tabellini, 2000). Thus, it is important to assume the presence of law enforcers having their own rent-seeking preference (i.e., profit-driven fine revenue-maximizing motivation) and consider their long-run incentives, such as future reelection rents by pandering to citizens’ interests, and short-run incentives for opportunistic behavior in the present. Then, while Langlais and Obidzinski (2017) show that whereas major crimes will be strongly punished and minor crimes will be weakly punished, our research provides different implications; while political accountability can discipline the rent-seeking law enforcer, insufficient disciplining incentives can still cause overenforcement for minor crimes and underenforcement for major crimes because of the presence of rent-seeking enforcers. This can be consistent with some empirical results by Makowsky and Stratmann, 2009, Makowsky and Stratmann, 2011 and Makowsky et al. (2019) in that profit-motivated issuance of speeding tickets and profit-motivated arrests for drug possession and prostitution, which can be called “victimless crimes”, seem to remain strict. Furthermore, we also note that for intermediate crimes, the democratic process can lead to the government’s inefficient pandering to voters and cause welfare deterioration, even compared to the pure rent-seeking enforcement case. If disciplining incentives are weak, this kind of distortion is less likely to occur. These results are different from Langlais and Obidzinski (2017). Additionally, our results show the mechanisms by which a society cares about the interests of criminals from political and economic perspectives; these issues were originally discussed by Dau-Schmidt (1990) and Lewin and Trumbull (1990).====Our results also provide welfare implications of the electoral cycle on law enforcement policies. According to Levitt (1997), increases in the size of police forces are related to mayoral and gubernatorial elections. Huber and Gordon (2004) show that elected judges become more punitive as their reelections approach. Dyke (2007) shows that defendants face a higher probability of conviction and a lower probability of having all charges dismissed in an election year. Berdejo and Yuchtman (2013) show that Washington state judges respond to political pressure by sentencing people convicted of serious crimes more severely. Bandyopadhyay and McCannon (2014) show that the number of convictions obtained in jury trials increases in the year before an incumbent runs for reelection. Nadel et al. (2017) investigate the relation between the local state attorney election and the punitiveness decision. Bandyopadhyay and McCannon (2015) investigate the relation between reelection concerns and the number of taken cases. McCannon (2013) shows that the popular election of prosecutors is related to inaccurate sentences, wrongful convictions, and successful appeals. Stashko and Garro (2021) investigate police use by prosecutors and show that for close elections, deaths decrease after a new district attorney ousts an incumbent. At the same time, law enforcement can be weakened by voting pressure. Even if illegal downloading and piracy can be punished, there seems to be fewer deterrence effects.==== Especially, as in Makowsky and Stratmann, 2009, Makowsky and Stratmann, 2011 and Makowsky et al. (2019), profit-driven law enforcers care about political accountability, although our results indicate that this may provide positive and negative welfare implications.====Our results can be helpful to understand the relation between democracy and crimes. Lin (2007) shows that whereas a less democratic society sets severe punishments for minor crimes, a more democratic society sets severe punishments for major crimes. Dusek (2012) shows that the collapse of communism in the Czech Republic in 1989 indicated strong deterrence effects for robbery, theft and intentional injury but not for murder or rape. Stamatel (2009) used postcommunist East-Central European datasets to show that homicide rates were negatively related to GDP per capita and positively related to ethnic diversity and population density. This author also concludes that progressive reforms toward democratization and marketization decreased homicide rates. Our paper contributes to understanding these empirical results by extending the discussion of Garoupa and Klerman (2002) that considers only rent-seeking law enforcers (i.e., less democratic society) to add political accountability, providing disciplining incentives for the rent-seeker to represent citizens’ interests (i.e., more democratic society).==== Additionally, if the political institutions become stable in more democratic countries, the government evaluates the future payoff and has more disciplining incentives, and then we can expect that citizens’ interests will be more represented, leading to weak/harsh law enforcement against minor/major crimes as society democratizes.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a law enforcement model incorporating the retrospective voting model. In Section 3, we compare the equilibrium outcomes with the social welfare efficiency level and discuss some extensions. In Section 4, we summarize our findings.",Law enforcement with rent-seeking government under voting pressure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000746,7 December 2022,2022,Research Article,13.0

This creates an important externality problem, as some of the benefits of better protection accrue to other private agents who would suffer from an attack. We analyze a model in which a social planner wants to provide incentives for the deployment of defensive technologies. Our results show that some features of the Safety Act, enacted after the 2001 terror attacks, are probably counterproductive.","When terrorists attack in order to cause mass casualties, they usually do this in settings where security is managed, at least in part, by private firms. For example, in the 9/11 attacks, the terrorists used planes owned by United Airlines and American Airlines to attack the World Trade Center, a building owned by a private sector entity.====Thus, private sector firms play a large role in protecting against terrorist attacks, both in terms of loss avoidance (e.g., making it harder to hijack planes) or loss mitigation (e.g., improving evacuation plans for buildings). However, the efficient provision of anti-terror defense is complicated by an obvious externality problem: Most of the damage avoided by the successful thwarting of a terrorist attack benefits other agents, not the firms that have to pay for the expenses necessary to use the defensive technology. Thus, we would expect that the equilibrium level of anti-terrorism defense chosen by private firms is suboptimal.====A similar externality problem arises also in some non-terrorist cybersecurity attacks that are undertaken for purely criminal purposes. On May 7th of 2021, Colonial Pipeline, a major American oil pipeline company, suffered a ransomware cyberattack that forced Colonial Pipeline to halt the flow of fuel for 5 days, leading to the shutdown of thousands of gas stations throughout the Southeastern United States, as well as massive gasoline shortages and dramatic price increases in the affected markets, with substantial consequences for millions of consumers. While Colonial Pipeline paid $5 million in Bitcoin as ransom, it is fairly clear that most of the economic damages caused by the cyberattack actually accrued to third parties.====While third parties can attempt to recuperate on those losses by suing, as over 10 thousand gas stations tried to by bringing a class action lawsuit against Colonial Pipeline, this is not feasible for the millions of customers who suffered harm from Colonial Pipeline’s inability to safeguard their network. As such, the incentives for security improvements are weaker than socially optimal.====While the standard economic policy response to positive externalities is to subsidize the underprovided activity, the U.S. Congress chose to take a different path in the aftermath of 9/11. Specifically, in 2002, Congress passed the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act (henceforth, the SAFETY Act) as an inexpensive way to subsidize the development and usage of anti-terrorism technologies.====This law empowers the Secretary of Homeland Security to certify certain anti-terrorism technologies (henceforth ATTs), and to limit the liability of users and suppliers of approved ATTs if the technology fails to stop an attack. Third-party liability in case of a successful attack is a substantial concern for many firms. For example, in 2005, a New York court found the owner of the World Trade Center, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, more than 65% liable for third party damages due to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing (Spence et al., 2012). By offering a safe harbor from such litigation, the SAFETY Act is essentially intended to act as an implicit subsidy for ATT investment.====A broad range of often industry-affiliated publications lay out the benefits of the SAFETY Act for different industries (e.g., Carpentier and Finch, 2012 for the natural gas and electricity industry; Biagini, 2008 for the airport management industry; Bryant, 2016 for the sports industry). Moreover, Harter (2006) and Knake (2016) suggest that SAFETY Act-like protections should be extended to other hazards, such as natural disasters or (non-terrorist) cyber attacks. It is therefore important to understand the economic effects of this type of liability-limiting law on loss-avoidance and loss-mitigation technology adoption.====We model the incentives for ATT provision by a firm that is a target of a potential attack. The firm chooses, at a cost, the ATT technology it wants to use, from a set of available technologies. The technology determines the probability with which an attack will be defeated. The firm also submits its chosen technology for certification by a regulatory agency. The probability of certification is increasing in the quality of the technology, and if the technology is certified, then the firm’s liability is limited to a prespecified level.====Because the liability limitation has an economic value and the probability of certification is increasing in the quality of the ATT, the firm has an incentive to choose a better technology. However, conditional on receiving the certification, the firm faces a reduced loss from a successful attack, and therefore has reduced incentives to choose a better ATT. In general, either effect can dominate. In particular, we show that, if the ATT has a sufficiently large probability of successful defense, then the SAFETY Act is counter-productive in the sense that the ATT chosen is lower than in the absence of the SAFETY Act. Furthermore, we show that these problems are exacerbated in a dynamic setting: Liability reductions which the firm acquired in the past reduce its incentive for further innovation.====Note that our analysis of the efficiency effects of the SAFETY Act focuses on anti-terrorism technology development and/or deployment, taking as given the probability of a terrorist attack. In addition to affecting the choice of ATT, the implicit subsidy through the liability reduction might also lead to excessive entry in the affected industries.==== However, this effect is quite indirect, and there might also be equilibrium effects on the behavior of terrorists (e.g., better defenses of a particular firm may redirect attacks towards other firms). It is beyond the scope of this article to analyze all general equilibrium effects of the SAFETY Act and alternative such as subsidies for defensive technology for private sector firms.====As argued by Shavell (1984), direct regulation is a frequent and relatively attractive policy option when some part of the damages remains uncompensated under liability. A standard objection to regulation — namely, that the regulatory agency cannot judge what makes sense for the private agent — does not apply here because the SAFETY technology designation or certification represents a procedure where the agency does exactly that: judge what makes sense for the private agent.====In fact, while there is no direct safety regulation in our model, some of the industries that are taking advantage of SAFETY Act provisions are already heavily regulated, such as the nuclear industry. In those industries, if the Office for the Implementation of the Safety Act just certifies the standard of care that firms have to choose to comply with the agency that regulates them directly, the liability limitations from the SAFETY Act essentially just constitute a lump-sum transfer to those firms, equal in value to the expected liability avoided. Yet, the scope of the SAFETY Act is considerably larger, and firms that applied successfully for certification or designation under the Act include many industries where safety against terrorist attacks is generally not directly regulated.==== Our model is most relevant for those industries.====Our paper contributes to the existing literature on the effects of liability rules (Shavell, 2009). Essentially, a liability limitation such as the one provided by the SAFETY Act can be interpreted as being similar to a combination of a strict liability rule (for the amount up to the limit) and a negligence rule for damage amounts that exceed the limit (Shavell, 1980). Furthermore, while the required level of care that leads to a liability exclusion under a negligence rule is usually up to interpretation by the court, under the SAFETY Act the technology is pre-approved by the regulatory agency, and so the firm is fairly certain about the level of liability it faces in case of a successful attack.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews related literature. Section 3 provides more detailed information about the SAFETY Act. The model is presented in Section 4, and analyzed in Section 5. Section 6 considers a dynamic extension of the model, and Section 7 concludes.",Incentives for investments in defensive technology: An economic analysis of the Safety Act,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000722,24 November 2022,2022,Research Article,14.0

Our dataset is derived from a comprehensive corpus of reports on early-modern English court cases. Leveraging existing topic-model estimates, we construct annual ==== of attention to each of the three legal domains between the years 1552 and 1764 and estimate a structural VAR. Property and procedure are affected for decades by their own shocks. Procedure and property coevolve. In contrast, contract adjusts quickly to its own shocks and does not coevolve with the other two areas of caselaw. We identify the episodes and events outside the legal system that correspond to systemic shocks. Edward Coke was a shock to procedure. The commercial revolution raised attention to contract. The Glorious Revolution, interestingly, did not lead to elevated attention to property issues, but the Civil War and Interregnum did. The evolution of contract, while relatively autonomous from the internal dynamics of the legal system, was, of the three legal domains, least autonomous from society.","The history of English law is to a notable extent a history of caselaw, evolving over many centuries via decisions in vast numbers of cases shepherded through the legal system by strict and meticulous procedure. This was the process by which the English legal profession developed core ideas in property and contract law. These ideas have become foundational elements of the institutional landscape of many modern capitalist societies. Before the Industrial Revolution, legislation and abstract jurisprudence influenced judicial decision-making and legal practice, but were not as prominent as sources of law as they would later become.====The central aim of this paper is to develop a quantitative macrohistory of the process of caselaw evolution during the early-modern era, focusing on three areas of law that formed the core of the English legal system in the two centuries before the Industrial Revolution: procedure, property, and contract.==== We do this by applying vector-autoregressive (VAR) analysis to a novel time-series dataset generated on the basis of prior topic-model estimates. Specifically, existing topic-model estimates, which provide a machine-learning digest of a large corpus of early-modern legal texts, facilitate the construction of time series of the legal system's attention to each of procedure, contract, and property over the years 1552–1764. VAR applied to these time series enables the investigation of their intertwined dynamics, offering insight into the coevolutionary development of the three aspects of caselaw during the two centuries immediately preceding the Industrial Revolution.====This paper makes two main contributions to the literature. The first is substantive: we generate an entirely new set of quantitative insights into the history of English law and the nature of England's legal development during the early-modern era. In particular, we provide a characterization of the coevolutionary development of three fundamental areas of caselaw, showing, for example, how much development in one area spurred or hindered development in other areas. In addition, we are able to distinguish periods of normal legal development from those times affected by large 'shocks', where idiosyncratic events occurring outside the court system, within the society more generally, had a powerful effect on legal development. As a consequence, we add directly to the stock of observations on decisive events in the development of English law and legal institutions. Throughout the analysis, our approach is therefore inductive. Much like traditional legal historians, we strive to uncover and synthesize new information about the flow of legal history, rather than test particular hypotheses.====Our second contribution is methodological: we demonstrate how VAR analysis applied to data generated via topic modeling can be productively employed to construct a quantitative macrohistory of legal evolution and coevolution using an approach that is relevant to the social sciences more generally. VAR has been used extensively to study recent historical events, such as changes in oil prices (Kilian, 2009, Baumeister and Kilian, 2016). But apart from a small set of notable contributions, it has been little used to study history before the Industrial Revolution, and certainly not legal history.==== This is undoubtedly because the data requirements of VAR analysis are quite demanding and legal-historical data have thus far not been readily available. Topic-modeling of texts addresses this problem by facilitating the creation of new quantitative measures, thereby enabling the application of VAR to investigate legal macrohistory.====Our central results may be summarized as follows. First, we find that external shocks, such as those emanating from legislation, lead to above-normal attention to an area of caselaw for many years, suggesting that unforeseen legal developments originating outside normal court processes cause many subsequent adjustments by the courts. This adjustment process takes longest for procedure, a result consistent with standard views of the rigidities inherent in the old common-law system. We also find that procedure and property coevolve: the development of caselaw and legal ideas on procedure helps to solve problems in the area of property while changes in procedure heighten attention to property issues, an indication that property law adjusts to fit procedures. In contrast, contract caselaw reacts quickly to external shocks and does not coevolve with the two other areas of caselaw.====Second, our use of VAR helps us to pinpoint the years when large external shocks affected the workings of the legal system. Our estimates reveal dozens of such episodes. For example, we clearly detect an effect attributable to Edward Coke: an innovating lawyer is a shock to the system. Coke's influence particularly coincides with heightened attention to procedure. Similarly, our estimates reveal that uncharacteristically strong development in property caselaw occurred early in the reign of Elizabeth (1558–1603) when real-property issues that had been left dangling by her predecessors were addressed by the courts. So pronounced are the episodes during Elizabeth's reign that much of the overall development of caselaw on property occurred during this time. In contrast, the large shocks to contract occur much later, especially in the period from 1665 to 1684. This is a time when commercialization of the economy was proceeding apace and the custom of merchants was being applied by judges to a much wider domain.====Third, our VAR methodology provides new comparative insights into the development of English property law during the two great revolutionary episodes of the 17th century: the Civil War-Interregnum era and the Glorious Revolution. Interestingly, in the raw data produced by topic-modeling, these two periods look very similar with respect to attention to property: neither period evidences an elevated attention to property. However, our analysis also reveals that those data are produced by very different configurations of circumstances. Attention to property from 1640 to 1654 reflects large positive shocks to property but also a lingering effect of very large past and current shocks to procedure, which depress attention to property. These cancel out in the raw data. During 1685–1700, in contrast, there are no lingering effects of shocks to procedure and no significant shocks to property. Thus, in the earlier era, external events caused the courts to pay increased attention to property issues, while in the later era there is no sign of any unusual external events spurring attention to property caselaw. This observation has relevance to the debates on when the most critical developments occurred in England in the 17th century (North and Weingast, 1989, Clark, 2007, McCloskey, 2010, Acemoglu and James, 2012, Ogilvie and Carus, 2014, Murrell, 2017, Hodgson, 2017).====Lastly, as a byproduct of our core analysis, we are able to add insights into the question of the degree of autonomy of legal processes. This is an old question, with many answers that often depend on the specific definition of autonomy (Tomlins, 2007). Using conceptualizations of legal autonomy directly implied by our VAR approach, the main insight generated by our empirical investigation is that the internal dynamics of the legal system explain much more of the development of caselaw on property and procedure than that on contract. For contract, the buffeting of unusual events outside the normal functioning of the system of litigation is much more important. Contract development, then, in comparison with property and procedure, is relatively more autonomous from the internal dynamics of the legal system, but relatively less autonomous from society.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a thumbnail of English legal history for those readers unversed in important details. Section 3 describes the steps taken in the construction of our time-series data, generated on the basis of prior topic-model estimates by Grajzl and Murrell, 2021a, Grajzl and Murrell, 2021b.

Based on an ====, we evaluated the impact on the mining companies’ abnormal returns surrounding the disaster and also investigated whether post-event judicial decisions affected the companies. Our results show a significant negative effect around the days of the event, reporting a 5 % drop in daily returns. Regarding the legal efforts, our findings suggest the coordination time and the benefits granted by authorities as being interpreted positively, reducing market’s expectation of an agile or severe punishment following Mariana’s dam disaster.","One of the most relevant socio-environmental disasters in Brazilian history took place in the city of Mariana, Minas Gerais State. In the year of 2015, the Samarco’s Fundão tailing dam - a joint venture owned by the blue bloods of the industry Vale and BHP Billiton – collapsed and nearly 45 million cubic meters of waste were launched directly into the environment. By the date, the rupture represented the largest mining disaster in the world in terms of volume regarding material that was released by the collapse (Losekann et al., 2019). In addition to the pollution of 668 kms of watercourses from the Doce River Basin to the Atlantic Ocean - main water supply for two Brazilian states, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo - the event also resulted in the death of 19 people and the destruction of a subdistrict, which housed nearly 600 residents (IBAMA, 2018). Nonetheless, even with the level of global visibility and sensibility given to the disaster, the perception of mining companies’ investors may not have been of absolute pessimism regarding the resilience of the companies and the output to be produced by Brazilian law enforcement in a post-event scenery.====Considering the scale of the event, in this study we measure the extent of market-imposed sanctions in environmental disasters in Brazil. We implemented a quantitative assessment of the Mariana dam failure impact on the abnormal returns of the mining companies involved in the event. Additionally, we provide the first study to estimate judicial decisions’ impact on share values of the companies involved in the same disaster. For that purpose, our approach follows the developments of the Federal Prosecutor’s Office legal proceedings. At each new announcement, we assessed whether the judicial decisions associated with the R$ 155 billion public civil action (approximately US$40 billion) generated a stock market’s reaction.====Firstly, to assess investors’ response of Samarco's parent companies (Vale and BHP Billiton) shortly after the occurrence of the disaster, we compared investors’ behaviour of another set of companies similar to Samarco, however unrelated to the event. Our findings indicate that Samarco`s dam collapse in Mariana conveyed new information relevant to the financial market, which is manifested in statistically significant negative stock abnormal returns for firms that held Samarco`s operations. These results help us understand how the mining companies ultimately involved in the dam’s collapse failed to anticipate the event. Only after the dam collapse information becomes publicly available, the event was incorporated into stock prices being traded – as can be noticed when we look at the drop in returns after November 5, 2015.====Secondly, we shed some light on the market’s reaction to the Brazilian judicial system’s performance in seeking to penalize the company directly involved in the event. Our results illustrate well how the same institutional response produces a distinct effect on the market over time. Initially, we observe a negative shock caused by the opening of the Public Civil Action, but next, we note the market losing sensitivity given the action's developments. It can be noted that much of the immediate price reactions in the 1st decision given by the authority were due to fear that a harsh and coordinated punishment from the Federal Prosecutor's Office (the highest public prosecutor body in the Brazilian judicial system) would take place against the companies. However, as the prosecution process proved to move slower than expected and the terms companies had to comply with mild, the following decisions given by the authority cease to have a negative effect on companies’ returns.====This study is associated with two strands of the literature. Studies assessing the correlation between stock variation and the occurrence of environmental accidents (Cagle, 1996, Worthington and Valadkhani, 2004) reveal that an immediate negative fluctuation is found in portfolios affected by such events. These studies are based on the premise that in stock valuation models - which assumes rationality - the decrease in value should occur if expectations indicate a drop in the firm's future cash flow. Therefore, the perception of risk deepens in cases such as environmental disasters, since companies involved in those events must experience additional costs related to reparation, litigation and decommissioning in some of its plants. Araújo et al. (2017) also propose the assessment of Mariana’s disaster and stock performance of the two firms involved - Vale and BHP Billiton. Adopting an event study methodology, the authors found a significant variation in the share prices of the companies. However, this effect was identified, first, in the Brazilian market and, later, in the Australian.====Our study, compared to Araújo et al. (2017), adopts a different strategy, as well as aims to answer additional questions concerning stock market reaction to the judicial system in the Mariana disaster. As in Guidolin and La Ferrara (2010), we associated an event study to the Fama-French three-factor model (1993), and a set of control companies also from the mining sector was considered as a comparison measure. This later exercise makes the causal relationship between share value losses in the face of exogenous shocks clearer. In addition, our study also shed light for the first time on the investors’ response to legal developments in Mariana's event with a long-term analysis that assesses the impact of judicial announcements on share performance.====The other branch of literature aligned to our study refers to the impact of news associated with environmental disasters or unwanted environmental conduct of firms. Hamilton (1995) clarifies that the daily loss companies register after having their pollution levels publicly disclosed can be linked to the costs related to regulatory compliance in favour of reducing pollution levels, or costly future obligations due to pollution cases. The conclusions drawn by Carpentier and Suret (2015) indicate that the market anticipates a low capacity for punishing environmental events. The authors highlight that, without government action, companies face an even lower cost imposed by investors. Dohlman et al. (2015) also point out that regulatory events have a negative impact on stock prices, indicating a drop in profit expectation and market share of companies.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we bring a literature review. The institutional framework is briefly described in Section 3. Our estimation strategy and database are presented in Section 4.

One especially crucial public service is the prosecution of crime. Communities thrive when law enforcement punishes wrongdoers, avoids overly harsh, disparate, and erroneous treatment, and secures the property and safety of its residents. Much of the discretion associated with the disposition of criminal cases is exercised by local prosecutors. They choose whether to file charges and which (and how many) charges to file. They engage in plea bargaining and represent “the people” at trial.====As with any career decision, individuals who choose to work in this job have a number of considerations that enter their occupational-choice decision making. While they care deeply about doing their job well, in an interesting survey of active prosecutors (Wright and Levine, 2018) record that job security, predictable hours, and not having to advertise for clients ranks high on the list of features that attract attorneys to the profession. Of course, salary is also important. Prosecutors are asked to exert substantial time and energy to clear the case backlog, effectively screen out those not culpable, and piece together a case to secure convictions of those who are guilty.====The public has a difficult principal–agent problem to overcome. Citizens are poorly informed about the office’s functioning. Monitoring prosecutor behavior is costly and the typical individual does not have the human capital to be able to evaluate the quality of the decision making. Nevertheless, the United States is unique in the world in its use of popular elections to select and retain local prosecutors. Thus, elections act as the primary accountability check on the quality of prosecution services provided.====Consequently, the community has two tools to incentivize prosecutorial effort. As articulated by Gordon and Huber (2002), voters can conceivably use the threat of not re-electing an incumbent to encourage the elected prosecutor to motivate effort exertion. The second tool available to the community is the compensation paid to the elected prosecutor. While the effects of the election mechanism on prosecutor decision making has received attention, to the best of our knowledge an exploration of the consequences of changes in prosecutor salary has not been documented.====Our research question revolves around the theory of efficiency wages. In an early, seminal contribution (Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984) argue that compensating individuals above the “going wage” can act to encourage extra effort exertion (or at least discourage shirking) as the threat of being fired becomes a motivation to work hard. An alternative argument for efficiency wages, put forth by Akerlof, 1982, Akerlof, 1984, is that high wages act similar to a gift exchange where the reciprocity motivation of workers encourages high effort, without monitoring being necessary. Regardless, wage increases should increase effort provision.====As a famous historical case study, Henry Ford paid workers in his automobile assembly factories $5.00 per day; far above prevailing market wages and a doubling of their previous compensation (Raff and Summers, 1987). With long lines of job seekers and, presumably, effort-enhancing goodwill developed with the workforce, productivity improved. Recent scholarship has conducted RCT field experiments that have reinforced the effect of efficiency wages (Gilchrist et al., 2016).====Scholarship in public administration calls this presumption into question. It has long been argued that monetary incentives can harm intrinsic motivations (Frey, 1997, Frey and Jegen, 2001). This may be especially prominent in public service jobs (Perry, 2018) and may counteract a public-service motivation (Taylor and Taylor, 2011).==== Compensation in the public sector tends to be below private market salaries. Thus, sorting in labor markets can lead to individuals with strong service-minded motivations being those employed in these jobs. Individuals working as prosecutors may have intrinsic motivations to “protect and serve”, putting relatively more weight on job performance and relatively less weight on financial compensation. In fact, evidence exists that greater monetary rewards may harm the warm glow created by serving others in public service professions (Deserranno, 2002). Hence, improved compensation may even harm the desire to exert effort. Finally, while the existence of efficiency wages may discourage shirking, what matters for policymakers is how a ==== increase in compensation affects effort provision ====. If an additional pay increase does not lead to additional effort (maybe because full effort is already being exerted), then public funds can be redirected to improve community well-being through other public services.====In light of potentially conflicting theoretical explanations for the impact of wage increases on public sector performance, especially for elected prosecutors, we empirically explore whether improved financial compensation leads to improved effort in prosecution services. There are two challenges we must overcome in performing this analysis. First, we must identify a reliable measurement of effort. This is difficult because the inability to use monitoring to solve this principal–agent problem hinges on the inability of voters to measure prosecutor effort. We use an innovative metric introduced by McCannon (2013) and DeAngelo and McCannon (2020) to measure prosecutor and judge effort, respectively. While the quality of case handling cannot be directly observed, appellate courts exist to evaluate the correctness of convictions obtained in lower courts. Appellate justices will have superior information about the handling of the case and whether it follows legal requirements. While numerous factors may play into the decision to modify or reverse a conviction, patterns to affirmations reveal changes in the incentive effects faced by legal actors. For example, McCannon (2013) links appellate cases in New York state to the election cycle of prosecutors. He finds that convictions which arise in the time window just prior to a prosecutor’s re-election are less likely to be upheld, conditional on appeal. DeAngelo and McCannon (2020) build on this by expanding the data set and including judge election cycles. They show that judges who were formerly prosecutors have higher accuracy in the criminal cases they are involved with, and this quality improves when they run for re-election. Judges who were not formerly prosecutors have a lower baseline quality, and get worse when up for re-election. We follow the lead set in these papers by using data on appeals from New York state as a measurement of errors in the case handling to proxy for legal actors’ effort provision.====Second, we need an exogenous shock that affects prosecutor compensation to engage in a causal identification. This is, of course, challenging in that compensation of public actors tends to be endogenously determined to solve a particular problem. For example, in the context of judicial pay, it is commonly argued that compensation needs to be improved out of concern that higher private sector pay will draw the most talented individuals away from public service. Further, in many states prosecutor compensation is uniform across the state, so that identifying the counterfactual outcomes are frustrated.====We leverage a unique, quasi-natural experiment in New York state. In 2011, after twelve years of no change in nominal pay, New York introduced legislation to increase state judge pay to the level of Federal judge salaries. Over a four-year phase in, it increased their compensation by more than 41%. Importantly, New York state law requires that head prosecutors are paid 95% of the judges’ salary. The prosecutor’s compensation is paid out of county funds, while judge salaries are paid from state funds. There is no evidence that the state legislators even considered the spillover effect of this radical pay increase. In fact, this unintended, unfunded spending mandate resulted in one county threatening to ignore the law and challenge it in court.==== Interestingly, New York state law relaxes the compensation rule for counties with populations under 100,000 residents. Thus, this quasi-natural experiment provides the opportunity, using a difference-in-difference estimation, to identify the causal effect of prosecutor compensation on the quality of the convictions obtained.====Our primary results fail to find evidence of an increase in efficiency wages as being an important motivating factor in the prosecution of local crime. The substantial pay increase has a strongly insignificant relationship with outcomes of appealed cases in the treated counties. Moreover, we show that the null result is robust to numerous model specifications.====Therefore, overall, a substantial pay increase for head prosecutors does not have a measurable effect on the effort exerted on cases, as measured by successful appeals. This suggests that, at the margin, efficiency wages are not driving prosecutor behavior. For violent crimes, where effort exertion is crucial, the decision to proceed to trial is potentially very costly, and a generous plea offer can save the prosecutor substantial resources. It is in these situations where improved compensation results in significantly higher affirmation rates.====Our work complements the growing literature studying the incentives of legal actors. While the decision making of judges has received substantial attention, recent investigations have begun to evaluate the drivers of prosecutor decision making. As a prominent example, criminal justice outcomes are strongly correlated with the prosecutor’s election cycle. When up for re-election, they are less likely to dismiss cases (Dyke, 2007), more likely to pursue a conviction at trial than plea bargain the case (Bandyopadhyay and McCannon, 2014, Bandyopadhyay and McCannon, 2015), create more incarcerations (Nadel et al., 2017), and commit more mistakes that are overturned upon appeal (McCannon, 2013). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first investigation into how prosecutor compensation impacts performance.====In a related application, Boylan and Long (2005) provide evidence that Federal Assistant U.S. Attorneys take more cases to trial when private market lawyer salaries are greater. They argue that career concerns are affecting their professional decision making. While our focus is on local prosecutors, we consider wage effects rather than outside labor market opportunities.====A handful of studies have considered judicial compensation. Similar to our results, Choi et al. (2009) and Baker (2008) suggest that increased judicial compensation has little to no measurable effect on performance. DeAngelo and McCannon (2017) consider the same pay increase in New York state and disentangle improved effort by established judges from the quality of new judges who choose to serve in the profession because of better compensation. They provide evidence that the pay increase primarily effects judges’ effort, not selection to the bench. Anderson and Helland (2012) evaluate variation in appellate judges salaries from 1977 to 2007. They find that there is a small reduction in the likelihood a judge leaves the bench, suggesting that higher pay does encourage judges to serve longer. Therefore, like our findings, there seems to be a mostly negligible impact of further pay increases on the effort of legal actors. Changes in outcomes can only be registered on small, specific margins.====Other than prosecutors and judges, studies have investigated the incentives of defense attorneys. Roach (2014) argues that changes in court-appointed attorney pay influences the effort exerted and, ultimately, the severity of the outcomes received by the defendant. Agan et al. (2020) compare defense attorneys representing paying clients and those representing indigent defendants (at a lower fee) and show that differences in effort exertion can explain a substantial amount of the difference between outcomes received by the indigent and non-indigent defendants. Similarly, Shem-Tov (2022) uses co-defendants where one has a public defender while the other has a court-appointed attorney to identify the improved effectiveness of public defenders. Lee (2021) compares pay based on a flat fee versus hourly compensation in a quasi-natural experiment in North Carolina. He finds that the change in compensation affects the conviction rate. Therefore, to achieve improvements in the effort of legal actors, it may be best to focus improved compensation on publicly-provided defense, rather than on prosecutors and judges.====In Section 2 we provide a simple theoretical model to clarify how changes in prosecutor effort corresponds to modifications and reversals of convictions upon appeal. Section 3 explains the quasi-natural experiment we use for our causal identification. The data and estimation strategy is described in Section 4. Section 5 presents the primary results, including the robustness checks.

As their chances of reelection can be harmed by failure of businesses, politicians may encourage the speed up of insolvency proceedings to mitigate the voters’ punishment before the elections. Using a sample of 82 countries covering the period 2005–2017, we examined how legislative and presidential elections affect the time required to resolve corporate insolvency. Surprisingly, panel estimates reveal that the length of time to resolve insolvency tends to actually increase during periods of legislative elections and one year prior to such elections in the case of rehabilitation procedures. As the political agenda of the new government can affect the efficiency of restructuring plans, the uncertainty of legislative election outcomes can incentivize debtor and creditors to prolong the resolution of a firm’s reorganization to adjust the plan and/or adopt the most suitable plan. Additionally, our ==== approach reports no significant association between the duration of insolvency procedures and the cycle of presidential elections.","Over the past five decades, there has been a sustained research activity in corporate failure (Jones and Wang, 2019) that has enjoyed a renaissance since the global pandemic crisis. Various failure definitions have been used in prior research, including: bankruptcy, insolvency and liquidation (Altman et al., 2017). Levratto (2013) noticed that a firm is considered financially distressed when the book value of its assets is less than the book value of its liabilities. Since Altman's (1968) pioneering empirical research, a common approach to categorizing business failure is to classify each firm as belonging to a single, specified category (failed or non-failed firms). Using a firm's status as a basis for classification, this definition of failure seeks to differentiate between failed and non-failed companies.====However, depending on national law, the biggest risk of financial distress is a firm’s dissolution in or out of court via a (non-)voluntary dissolution (Stef and Zenou, 2021, Stef and Bissieux, 2022). This outcome implies bankruptcy costs, widely discussed in the literature since Warner (1977), falling into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct costs include legal and accounting fees, fees of other professionals and the value of managers' time in managing and administering bankruptcy proceedings (Altman, 1984). The indirect costs are observable from a slowdown in sales, loss of profits and possible loss of credibility and image of the firm. However, the amount of those costs could delay regulators intervening on failing institutions before an election (Brown and Dinc, 2005). For example, according to the theory of political business cycles, public authorities would be proactive and utilize fiscal and monetary policy before elections to boost their popularity and, as a result, their chances of reelection (Nordhaus, 1975, Leverty and Grace, 2018). Brown and Dinc (2005) also reported that political considerations play an important role in delaying government action in failing institutions. Failing banks are much less likely to be taken over by the government or have their licenses revoked before elections than after. Liu and Ngo (2014) used exogenous variation in the timing of gubernatorial elections to investigate the timing of bank failures in the United States revealing that the probability of bank’s failure decreases by 45 % during an election year. Leverty and Grace (2018) examined the impact of elections on the property-liability insurance market in the United States, and they found that the likelihood of a regulatory intervention decreases by 78 % in the year before a presidential election. The findings also discover evidence that election delays significantly raise the cost of insurer failure.====Nevertheless, one of the consequences of delaying the resolution of a firm’s insolvency is that the reallocation of assets towards more efficient uses will also be delayed leading to a slowdown of entrepreneurial activity (Peng et al., 2009, Melcarne and Ramello, 2020). Additionally, such delay can harm the going concern value as the amount of bankruptcy costs tend to accumulate (Thorburn, 2000, Dou et al., 2021), thus affecting the creditors’ reimbursement and the firm’s chances to survive. In light of those consequences, a study investigating how electoral cycle impacts the time to resolve insolvency is of major importance. In order to give a crisp identification of the influence of electoral politics on the duration of insolvency resolution, this current study relies on cross-sectional and time-series variation in the timing of legislative and presidential elections. Our analysis is closely related to the early work in this field suggesting that politicians can have incentives to take activities that generate good macroeconomic results prior to elections to avoid voters’ punishment (Key, 1966, Rogoff and Sibert, 1988). Consequently, politicians may encourage a quicker resolution of corporate insolvency before elections. We provide insight on the consistency of this assumption by using a panel data set of 82 countries over the period 2005–2017.====We make several contributions to the theoretical and empirical literature on bankruptcy resolution under political elections. First, our work is related to the body of literature investigating the impact of elections on regulatory measures. In this regard, Brown and Dinc (2005) conducted their research at the bank level, demonstrating that bank collapse is substantially less common before an election. Using the cross-sectional and time-series variation in the exogenous electoral cycles of US insurance regulators and governors, Leverty and Grace (2018) examined whether elections delay regulatory action against failing financial firms. The findings revealed causal evidence that regulators postpone involvement before elections. The length of the delay is greater for elected regulators than for governor-appointed regulators. Our current investigation extends this literature by examining the influence of political elections on the length of two types of insolvency proceedings, such as the exit and the rehabilitation procedures. Second, unmatched subsamples may reduce the degree of data comparability in cross-country research on bankruptcy systems, resulting in sample selection bias. In this study, we retain data comparability by using the methodology of Djankov et al. (2008), which was further improved by the ===='s ====. Third, we associate for the first time the database of Cruz et al. (2018) on political environment with bankruptcy dimensions. By using that data set, we distinguish between elections for the presidential branch and those for the legislative branch.====The remainder of this investigation is organized as follows: Section 2 addresses the relationship between political elections and the length of insolvency proceedings, Section 3 statistically describes our sample, Section 4 presents our estimates and the robustness checks, and Section 5 presents the conclusions and the major caveats of our econometric approach.",Time to resolve insolvency and political elections,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000606,30 October 2022,2022,Research Article,20.0

By examining antidiscrimination laws and their implications for women-led businesses' access to credit in 124 countries, the current study differentiates an effect on discouragement (i.e., not asking for credit when they need it, demand side) and an effect on the probability that they obtain credit (supply side). Legal protections are associated with lower discouragement for women-led firms, but they do not support the attainment of more credit. We demonstrate that enforcement efforts dramatically amplify the effect of women-friendly laws on self-restrictions in terms of credit and enable women-led firms to access more credit. Women are sensitive to the legal environment in which they operate, while banks need strong incentives to change their behavior. This effect is notable with regard to rational discouragement and prevails among smaller firms and in high-income countries. These results are robust to several tests.","In recent years, many countries around the world have been trying to rebalance the legal difference in treatment between men and women to overcome discrimination in several areas: labor, marriage, parenthood, entrepreneurship and credit access. For example, Honduras voted for the Equal Opportunity for Women Act in 2000. One of the main purposes of these laws is to allow women to have easier access to credit and thus enable their economic empowerment. However, despite national and supranational legal initiatives, discrimination in the credit market remains. This raises the crucial question of the effect of the law: do antidiscrimination clauses truly have the expected effect on the credit market?====The aims of this paper are twofold: first, we shed light on the impact of the law protecting women on the behavior of women and banks; second, we investigate how law enforcement impacts this relation.====More precisely, we examine how laws protecting women in the credit market impact (1) their discouragement (demand side of the credit market) and (2) their probability of obtaining credit (supply side). The literature suggests that women tend to apply less for credit, arguably discouraged because they fear being denied (e.g., Alesina et al., 2013). On the supply side, their likelihood of receiving credit is lower than that of men (de Andrés et al., 2021).====To address this concern, we use country-level data on gendered legislation from the Women, Business, and the Law indicators (====)==== with firm-level creditor and financial data extracted from Enterprise Surveys (====). From these sources, we obtain a vast and representative sample with variability in both temporal and cross-sectional dimensions, such that it includes 35,777 firms in 124 countries during the years 2010–2020. To quantify the effect of gendered legislation on female borrowers’ sense of discouragement and actual loan approval, we consider the legal prohibitions of discrimination by creditors.====The results show that female entrepreneurs’ sense of discouragement is weaker in the presence of a women-friendly judicial environment, but they do not necessarily obtain more credit. We thus highlight the fact that while a law protecting women in the credit market seems to have an impact on their behavior, it does not have an impact on banks’ behavior. Deeply entrenched social norms still hinder the efficacy of legal reforms, even after controlling for cultural and business environments. However, we also prove that if legislators want to reduce this discrimination, a ==== condition can ensure law enforcement: the greater the rule of law is, the lower the gendered differential treatment from the bank’s perspective if the law includes a clause against discrimination in access to credit. Hence, our paper provides original evidence on the importance of law enforcement in the fight against discrimination.====We confirm the robustness of our results with six tests, in which we (1) control for borrowers’ quality, focusing on those who have already obtained a bank loan in the credit market; (2) use alternative measures of gender-specific law; (3) restrict the sample to respondents who consciously answered the questionnaire; (4) oversample some countries to increase internal validity; (5) address the potential for endogeneity bias using an instrumental variable (IV) estimation; and (6) control for a potential selection bias by running a Heckman (1979) estimation.====Then, through three extensions, we seek further insights. First, we clarify that women’s rational discouragement decreases if the legislation includes a female-specific clause, but their emotional discouragement is not affected. In this sense, favorable legislation encourages creditworthy borrowers to submit loan applications. More specifically, women are sensitive to their legal environment, so a gender-equality law may have a stronger effect on their rationale than emotional perceptions of discouragement. Second, when we split the data set into two subsamples of large and small firms, we find stronger effects for smaller companies. In smaller entities, the CEO exerts a stronger influence on decision-making, in line with the CEO effect theory. Third, we also scrutinize the effect of regional economic development: the beneficial effect of gender-specific laws is observable only in high-income countries.====These findings offer two main contributions. First, we advance the literature about the effect of the legal framework on economic outcomes by investigating the impact of law on the credit market. La Porta et al. (1997) document a positive correlation between the adaptability of the legal system and the depth of credit markets. Anyangah (2017) similarly shows that better protection of creditor rights leads to an improvement in the terms of credit. To contribute to this stream of literature, we explore and confirm that a gendered legal environment can explain women-owned firms’ credit-seeking behavior. Moreover, our findings are in line with the argument of Djankov et al. (2008) and Fabbri (2010), according to which judicial efficiency should necessarily apply to ensure optimal credit allocation. To the best of our knowledge, no prior study attempts to quantify the effect of an antidiscrimination law on the credit market - a critical blind spot, considering how cultural and social norms can overwhelm formal legal frameworks. Second, we add to studies about the macroeconomic determinants of access to credit. In particular, we reveal the impacts of country-specific factors on loan application probability and bankers’ decision-making, in line with Asiedu et al.’s (2012) predictions of the relevance of country particularities. Gender-based differences in access to credit vary widely across regions, and Ongena and Popov (2013) have shown that supply-side discrimination becomes exacerbated in countries with more severe inherited cultural gender biases (e.g., Yugoslavian countries) than in those with weaker historical gender biases (for instance, Ireland). We complement such findings by including the national legal framework as a country-specific determinant of supply-based discrimination against female business owners.====In Section 2, we discuss prior research, which provides the background that motivated our research. Section 3 contains descriptions of the data, empirical method, and variables. After we provide the results in Section 4, we offer robustness checks in Section 5. Then, we look at additional analysis that can explain our results in Section 6. Finally, we conclude in Section 7.",Girls Just Wanna Have Funds?

Using a Spatial ","Detroit, Michigan, is well-known not only for its most significant auto industries but also for its high crime rates. Since the infamous riot of 1967, high crime rates and negative media reports have labeled this city as one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S., and a huge number of residents have moved out of this city in the past few decades. This situation has also brought tremendous pressure on the government and police departments. Lots of attention has been drawn from scholars and researchers to answer what and why this happened in Detroit and how to provide informative and constructive information for policymakers and the public.====Crime study has received substantial research interest in Economics since the pioneering work on economic analysis of crime by Nobel laureate (Becker, 1968). Crime affects our daily life by deteriorating the living environment of the communities, which also reduces people’s sense of security and lowers social welfare. Understanding the development and spread of crime as well as its interactions with social and economic factors are of great policy relevance. These insights can help distribute public safety resources more efficiently and wisely, and subsequently improve economic efficiency and social stability (Glaeser et al., 1996, Andresen, 2005, Andresen, 2006, Bernasco et al., 2017).====As discussed in Owens et al. (2020), problems of residential externalities and neighborhood level multiple equilibria are critical “development guarantees” to revitalize Detroit. Furthermore, the “guarantee” requires the coordination of residents and public safety. Social disorganization theory of crime also states that community is a key factor that helps maintain order in neighborhoods and crime control (Martin, 2002). Ways to open the black-box of spatial and temporal patterns in criminal activities within the city may provide valuable insights for prioritizing police resources as well as effective police resource targeting strategies in Detroit.====In the literature, the causes and theories of crime have been developed and investigated in many disciplines, such as geography, sociology, economics, and so on. Among these disciplines, socio-economic variables, as well as spatial characteristics are known to affect crime rates and types of crime (Ratcliffe and McCullagh, 1999, Kakamu et al., 2008, Menezes et al., 2013). Particularly, spatial interaction has been investigated in many studies (Messner et al., 1999, Andresen, 2005, Andresen, 2006, Andresen, 2007, Kakamu et al., 2008, Andresen and Malleson, 2013, Shi and Lee, 2018). Spatial interaction refers to a dynamic movement of human activities, such as criminal activities, from one place to another or nearby locations. Theoretical work in economics, sociology, and criminology has also underlined the concepts of social interactions, such as peer effects, social norms, neighborhood effects, etc., which indirectly supports the importance of spatial interaction in empirical research of crime. Methodologically, the presence of spatial interaction implies the commonly used ordinary least squares (OLS) models are misspecified and biased without considering the correlations among the dependent variable (Anselin, 1988, Anselin, 2001, Menezes et al., 2013).====Spatial models have gained popularity in crime studies since the 1970s. At the beginning, most spatial analyses were location or geographical based studies. Hotspot mapping and modeling, distance statistics and other geospatial techniques are widely used in analyzing the spatial characteristics of crimes (Pyle et al., 1974, Brantingham and Brantingham, 1984, Ratcliffe and McCullagh, 1999, Chainey et al., 2008, Ratcliffe, 2010, Leitner, 2013). Additionally, exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) is a set of tools and techniques that helps identify patterns and other features of the data before doing any modeling and data processing work. Based on ESDA, several studies report positive spatial autocorrelation and spatial clusters of county homicide rates (Messner et al., 1999). Recently, with the development and advance of econometric methodology, an increasing number of researchers from different fields have employed spatial econometric models in their research of crime (Brown, 1982, Kakamu et al., 2008, Scorzafave and Soares, 2009, Menezes et al., 2013). However, few studies have well investigated the patterns and development of crime in the city of Detroit, especially the internal space–time relationship of criminal activities.====As discussed in many studies (e.g., Kakamu et al., 2008, Sparks, 2011), the spatial pattern of crime is related to a variety of social, economic, and demographic characteristics as well as crime opportunity factors over time and space. The interdependence in crimes among block groups could be due to spatial spillover across neighboring blocks. This spatial dependence across blocks can be resulted from the information sharing among the peer criminals, social norms formed in the peer group, as well as cost sharing among peers in the sense that more criminals lowers the probability of getting arrested. The spatial interaction in crimes across nearby blocks generates a feedback and snowball effect, which could amplify the impact of crime deterrence policy intervention. In contrast, the correlation in crime across space could also be caused by some common (and usually unobserved) external factors or forces faced by nearby blocks, such as efficient law enforcement could reduce crime incidents in neighboring blocks. Another example is that the installment of alarm system in a community could also help deter crime activities in the neighborhood, leading to co-movement in crime incidents across block groups. This type of spatial correlation is termed “correlated effect” (Manski, 1993), which is not due to interaction or spillover among the blocks, and does not generate any feedback or multiplier effect. Therefore, a clean identification of the spatial interaction effect is important for crime deterrence policy implementation and evaluation.====In this study, we specify a spatial dynamic panel data (SDPD) model with both individual and time fixed effects proposed in Lee and Yu (2010b) to investigate the spatial and intertemporal evolution of criminal activities among the block groups in Detroit. We use an ==== matrix ==== with zero diagonal, where ==== is the number of block groups, to capture the correlations among the neighboring blocks. We specify a model where the logarithm of crime incidents is related to contemporary average logarithm of crime incidents in neighboring blocks (contemporary spatial spillover effect), own lag crime incidents from past year (pure dynamic effect), lag average logarithm of crime incidents of neighboring blocks (time–space simultaneous effect). The individual and time fixed effect terms capture the possible confounding effects caused by unobserved block heterogeneity as well as the unobserved time varying factors.====We study the aggregate crime incidents as well as six types of crime in two categories: aggravated assault, assault, and weapons offenses in violent crime; burglary, robbery and stolen vehicle in property crime by using crime data collected from Detroit Open Data Portal. Furthermore, to explore the impact of the block level social-economic characteristics on crime, we employ the 2010 block group level Detroit census data. For aggregated crime incidents, we find that the crime incidents of neighboring blocks are highly correlated, with an estimated coefficient of 0.4758 contemporaneously; and an estimated coefficient of 0.1572 in the following year. We also identify a positive pure dynamic effect coefficient, indicating time persistence in the criminal activities among the block groups. These findings are robust against different model specifications based on alternative spatial weights matrices. For the three violent crimes and three property crimes, overall, the findings suggest strong spatial and temporal correlations among neighboring blocks, even after controlling for the confounding effects. These findings provide preliminary evidence for re-allocating police resource in certain patrol areas within Detroit. Police resource should be more efficiently distributed by taking into account the correlations across space and over time, especially for setting up targeting patrol areas for crime deterrence and reduction.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 synthesizes existing literature of crime analysis and application of spatial autoregressive models. In Section 3, we introduce the methodology and model specification. Detailed data description is presented in Section 4.

With international collaboration, gender inequality has been gradually addressed among higher education, political functionary, and entry-level professional roles, but receives less attention in senior professional roles. Especially, it has never been easy for a woman to become senior executives, compared with a man.==== Countries such as Norway started to introduce legislation or governance codes to encourage female representation in the boardroom, also known as board gender diversity reforms (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012, Matsa and Miller, 2013). Many reforms set a certain gender quota requirement (e.g., 40 % in Norway).==== The legislation and governance codes force or at least pressure companies to hire more female directors, which provides a unique opportunity to test whether having more female directors would affect corporate outcomes. Prior studies that make use of those reforms mainly focus on their effect on firm value and operating performance in a single country (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012, Bertrand et al., 2019, Eckbo et al., 2016, Ferrari et al., 2018, Matsa and Miller, 2013, Reguera-Alvarado et al., 2017). However, literature that studies gender diversity regulations around the world and their impact on women’s efforts in promoting corporate social responsibility is rather limited. We attempt to fill this research gap by investigating whether female representation in the boardroom contributes to better CSR performance using international data.====Based on ==== (Eagly et al., 2000), we justify why female directorship might increase a firm’s CSR activates in three ways. First, female directors tend to adopt a democratic and communal leadership style due to women’s special psychological traits (Eagly, 2013, Eagly and Johnson, 1990) and are more likely to listen to the claims of stakeholders (Adams et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2013). Second, they also tend to be more sensitive to ethical issues (Gilligan, 1993, Simga-Mugan et al., 2005), such as environmental violations (Liu, 2018). Third, women are more community-minded (De Dreu and Nauta, 2009) with high involvement in corporate charitable giving (Jia and Zhang, 2013), a significant aspect of CSR. Therefore, we hypothesize that gender diversity in the boardroom could lead to better firm engagement in corporate social responsibility.====We first examine the relationship between female director representation and CSR performance reflected by environmental and social rating. We collect data from ASSETS 4 ESG database, Worldscope, and BoardEx to measure firm-level CSR, financial information, and board-level characteristics. After requiring non-missing values, our sample includes 40,341 firm-year observations in 6780 unique firms among 63 countries between 2002 and 2018. After controlling for firm and year fixed effects, we document a positive and significant relationship between female director representation and CSR performance. Specifically, one standard deviation increase in female representation on boards is associated with a 0.356 (0.462) increase in the environmental (social) performance. However, such results do not indicate a causal relationship. Female directors could be endogenously assigned to firms. For example, it is possible that a socially responsible firm tends to hire more women. To address such endogeneity concerns, we apply a difference-in-differences (DID) design using the staggered adoption of boardroom gender diversity regulations in different countries around the world. Our DID design using periods around the reform of the board gender diversity helps separate the effect of boardroom gender diversity reforms from other factors potentially affecting firm CSR performance, which enables us to identify the causal effect.====To examine the enforcement power of gender diversity regulations, using a difference-in-differences design, we test whether the adoption of such regulations, both legislation and governance codes, can significantly increase female representation on boards. Consistent with prior studies (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012, Martinez-Garcia and Gomez-Anson, 2020, Matsa and Miller, 2013), we find that a legislative regulation leads to a more significant increase in female representation on boards than governance code regulation does.====After ensuring that regulations are able to increase female representation in the boardroom, we explore whether such regulations lead to improved engagement in socially responsible activities, as captured by higher environmental and social ratings. We find that firms in countries with gender diversity regulations experienced a significant increase in CSR performance. We further distinguish the two types of reforms: legislation-based reforms and governance code-based reforms. The legislation-based reforms result in stronger effects on a firm’s environmental and social performance, likely due to the higher enforcement power associated with a legislative measure. In the gender diversity reform context, laws introduced to encourage female representation on boards often include clear quota targets and penalties for non-compliance.====In further analysis, we find that the impact of female director representation on CSR performance is more pronounced in high gender social norm subsample. The gender social norm is captured by gender social norm index (GSNI) available from the UNPD Human Development Report Data Centre, based on prior findings that individuals’ value and behavior are shaped by social norms (Dyck et al., 2019, Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009).====Finally, we examine whether legal origins affect the effect female directorship on CSR performance. To implement the test, we classify countries as common law countries and civil law countries to capture the quality of legal enforcement. Common law countries are associated with better legal enforcement compared to civil law countries (La Porta et al., 1997, Porta et al., 1998; Klerman et al., 2011). We find that the positive effect of female directors on CSR is more pronounced in common law countries.====Our study contributes to the literature in multiple ways. First, the majority of studies analyzing the impact of gender diversity in the boardrooms on corporate outcomes suffer from endogeneity. For example, a well gender-balanced corporate board is associated with better board meeting attendance rate and monitoring efforts (Adams and Ferreira, 2009a, Boutchkova et al., 2020), earnings quality (Srinidhi et al., 2011), enhanced innovation (Torchia et al., 2011), and improved CSR ratings (Bear et al., 2010, Liu, 2018, McGuinness et al., 2017), reduced likelihood of financial restatement (Abbott et al., 2012), of financial misconduct (Wahid, 2019), and of empire-building (Levi et al., 2014). There are two limitations in these studies. First, female managers are not exogenously added, so it is difficult to claim causality. Second, estimations relying on data from a single country/industry (Bear et al., 2010, Liu, 2018, McGuinness et al., 2017) might have some unobserved country/industry-specific factors that both correlate with female directors being on the board and CSR outcomes. To address the concern of endogeneity, we make use of the quasi-experiment of gender diversity reforms in the boardroom as an exogenous shock to female representation to estimate its impact on corporate social responsibility.====Second, this study contributes to the literature on the role of unestablished rules, social norms in law and economics. Prior studies suggest social norms can affect economic and market outcomes (Akerlof, 1980, Dyck et al., 2019, Guiso et al., 2009, Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). Institutional investors carry culture perception in their investing behavior and their CSR values to their portfolio firms (Dyck et al., 2019). Little attention has been paid to gender social norms, apart from Boutchkova et al. (2020) who document that gender social norms within the boardroom can affect how directors act. Following this line of enquiry, we provide supporting evidence that female directors are better able to influence a firm’s CSR under the norms that favor gender equality and women’s empowerment.====Finally, this study contributes to the body of literature on the impact of boardroom gender diversity reforms by using a global sample. Current studies on gender diversity in corporate board reforms are mainly relying on a single reform, and mixed findings are reported (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012, Bøhren and Staubo, 2016, Ferrari et al., 2018, Greene et al., 2020, Matsa and Miller, 2013, Yang et al., 2019). For example, some studies on Norway’s boardroom gender diversity reform find that a quota reform leads to a decline in firm value and operating performance (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012, Bøhren and Staubo, 2016, Matsa and Miller, 2013, Yang et al., 2019). Eckbo et al. (2016) find no effect of gender quota law on firm value, and suggest that the decline of firm value after the quota could be explained by the decline in post-quota CEO experience. Similarly, Greene et al. (2020), Hwang et al. (2018), and Meyerinck et al. (2018) find a negative impact of the gender quota law introduced in the California, U.S on market value of firms. While Ferrari et al. (2018) document the effect to be positive following Italy’s gender quota reform. The differences in these findings might be explained by specific country-related characteristics. Therefore, this study employs data from multiple countries and uses boardroom gender diversity reforms around the world to as an exogenous shock to estimate its impact on corporate social responsibility.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

Super-PACs raise their money from individuals and corporations and spend it to promote their cause. Numerous commentators studied their impact on the American political landscape and highlighted its implications from a constitutionally driven perspective, anchored in the Free Speech clause of the First Amendment as it applies to corporate persons. In this Essay we analyze the phenomenon from a different vantage point, the prohibition to spend other people’s money in support of a cause which they refuse to endorse. We prove that although contributions made by private donors to super-PACs may sometimes be justified, no such redeeming grace is tenable in the case of contributions made by large public corporations. The distortion is caused by inviting corporations to identify their presumed political preferences by employing the decision rule current in corporate matters of “one share one vote” which allocates disproportionate power to the holders of large blocks of shares. Since political controversies ought to be governed by a different decision rule- “one person one vote” the distortion cannot be remedied through the intermediation of corporate players.","More than a decade ago, the United States Supreme Court has famously ruled, in the seminal case of ====,==== that corporations enjoy First Amendment privileges of free speech and hence are free to financially support (or oppose) political candidates in pursuit of federal office====. Understandably, this ruling was soon followed by a deluge of scholarly papers trying to assess its impact on the body politick and to indicate how it might change the balance of power between the well to do, who can afford to spend large amounts of money in furtherance of their favorite agendas, and the less wealthy, whose political efforts may stumble for lack of sufficient means to join the political struggle ====. In recent years the battleground moved from individual donors to what is termed super-PACs (acronym for large political action committees), which bundle together contributions from entities and individuals and use them for essentially the same purpose====. In the United States, super-PACs were commonly used in support of candidates from both sides of the Congressional aisle, although some prominent politicians from the “progressive” faction within the Democratic Party, while standing guard against the proliferation of traditional super-PACs, have secured for their agendas financial support from groups that raise essentially the same political dilemma====.====In another landmark decision, the Supreme Court removed all spending limits on both corporate and individual contributions to super-PACs====, a decision that sparked exponential growth of the dollar amounts that were channeled to political campaigns.==== This development requires a fresh assessment of the case from various perspectives, including the threat of subjugating the American electoral system to the whim of the super-rich. Although the constitutional concerns raised by opponents of either kind of donations share a clear common denominator, in this paper we wish to focus attention on contributions made by public corporate entities, thus leaving aside all the remaining concerns focusing on contributions made by individual donors. The striking difference between donations made by individuals and those made by corporations, is that individual donors use their own resources in furtherance of their cause, while corporate donors are free to dip into the common treasury of all their stockholders whose political affiliations may be far from uniform. This distinction may have escaped the attention of the justices in the ==== case, perhaps due to the fact that the litigating entity within their sights was formed by a group of individuals sharing an identical political slant (a fierce opposition to the candidacy of Hillary Fordham Clinton in the primary Democratic elections race of 2008)====, but such uniformity of preferences is not likely to occur among the stockholders of other corporations, significantly of the public variety====.====There is one important matter that we wish to clarify at the outset. Arguably, although corporations are constituted by amassing a large number of stockholders, they nonetheless speak in a single voice, the authorized voice of their elected incumbents. The latter derive their authority from the stockholders’ presumed consent, arrived at by employing a decision rule which weights votes disproportionally, normally reflecting the popular principle of “one share one vote”. Obviously, dominant stockholders (other stake-holders are excluded from the vote) can often carry the vote single-handedly and in other occasions retain a clear advantage in the final count====. Although this election method may have its own justifications in run-of-the-mill corporate matters====, it is justly banned in political contests and substituted by a very different decision rule- “one person one vote” (the principle of “universal suffrage” now endemic to all modern election methods), thus equalizing the voting weights across the constituency====. It clearly follows that if the dominant incumbents employ the corporate decision rule and thus reflect their own preferences for or against a political cause, they dip their fingers in other people’s money==== and hence deserve to be scrutinized from a fresh vantage point. This is exactly the idea behind the analysis that follows.====In Section 1 we develop a simple, stylized model revealing the likely effect of corporate financial support of political agendas. The model shows that although some justifications of the practice can be detected in the case of small and politically insignificant (in financial terms) close corporations, no such silver lining may possibly be revealed in the case of the more substantial corporate donors, the large public corporations. Section 2 suggests a few extensions. Section 3 builds on some insights derived from the previous two Sections and dwells on the slippery interface of corporate and constitutional rights; and then it concludes.====Our model makes a few of assumptions. The most significant one is that corporate stockholders in widely dispersed public corporations are evenly divided between supporters and opponents of high profile controversial ideological issues. For example, if Citizens United were (counter-factually) a public corporation, the number of its stockholders willing to join the campaign to smear the reputation of Hillary Clinton would roughly equal the number of other stockholders who are interested to support her candidacy. Similarly, if the constitutional issues relating to birth control were to be decided by a plebiscite, the number of pro-life supporters would not be much different from the number of pro-choice supporters. Of course we do not attempt to mimic any kind of mathematical precision, but for the sake of our model an approximation will do. The next assumption is that although the cost of any ideological expenditure (====) financed by corporate entities is borne by all its stockholders in proportion to the size of their holdings (amounting to ==== for each share, where ==== is the number of outstanding shares) there is a non-pecuniary gain or loss that comes along with the deal: Stockholders who support the expenditure gain a utility of ====, and stockholders who are opposed to the expenditure suffer a disutility of –====. This assumption ignores the intensity distribution of the voters’ ideological stance that can in reality range from intense to lukewarm, but in the aggregate it seems safe to assume an average constant on either side of the divide. We finally assume that the public invests in public corporations primarily for gain and not for ideology. This is not because we ignore the enthusiasm of many investors to take a stand on ideological matters, but simply because at the time of investment they are normally ignorant about the future intentions of their corporate stewards regarding their support of, or opposition to, any political campaign. This “veil of ignorance” is further thickened by the common practice of many corporations to divide their loyalty between rivals, as a precautionary strategy not to alienate either.====With these preliminaries out of the way we are prone to state our model.",Citizens united and individual sovereignty: A fresh perspective,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000552,29 September 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

This discouragement stems from strong ,"Ensuring access to credit for companies has long been a key goal of international organizations. A major obstacle for firms in general and for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular is limited access to credit, not only through rejected applications but also in the form of a reluctance to apply. For the United States, Levenson and Willard (2000) estimate that the number of discouraged borrowers is twice as large as the number of rejected borrowers. That is, discouragement with respect to applying may be a much more important barrier since it supplants credit rationing, the oldest, best-known obstacle to receiving credit (Jaffee and Russell, 1976, Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981). Hence, this issue represents a major challenge for regulators, who also have a role to play (Macher et al., 2011; Krishnamurthy, 2014). Kon and Storey (2003) show that an important determinant of discouragement is information asymmetry between lender and borrower, mostly for SMEs (Bertrand et al., 2021). As we know, such information asymmetry can be reduced in two ways: internally, by the accumulation of information through exchanges, or externally, by the creation of credit bureaus or registries that possess information (Bertrand and Klein, 2021). However, the establishment of such institutions is largely up to regulators and the laws they can put in place to facilitate their creation.====The aim of this study is to clarify for regulators the usefulness of developing credit registries by examining the impact of such registries on the probability of firms being discouraged. Kon and Storey (2003), in their seminal theoretical study on borrowers’ discouragement, assess the importance of information asymmetry to determine discouragement. Information asymmetry, or at least attempts to reduce it, lies at the heart of financial intermediation. In any type of transaction, both parties must collect a sufficient amount of trustworthy information to adjust a contract’s specificities to risk pricing. Given the risky nature of loans to firms and institutions, the collection of relevant information to reduce asymmetry is crucial. Kon and Storey (2003) highlight three main consequences of information asymmetry that directly bear on borrowers’ discouragement. First, screening errors committed by banks when they assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. Although the rejection of the application of a good borrower is less significant from the bank’s perspective than the validation of a bad one, the true (that is, social and economic) cost of such rejections remains substantial. Second, the administrative and financial burden charged to the candidate borrower also represents a key determinant of discouragement. In essence, banks circumvent the issue of information asymmetry by transferring the burden of proof to the borrower, thus significantly increasing the financial and psychological costs of an application. Finally, since they cannot precisely evaluate or rule out any of the underlying risks of a credit transaction, banks tend to require a higher interest rate to compensate for unforeseen or unobservable adverse events that could significantly modify the credit default probability.====Since the question of information is of crucial importance, banks invest substantial resources to collect as much and as accurate information as possible. This collection of information can be conducted in two ways: internally (by relationship lending, for example) or externally (via credit bureaus or registries). As highlighted by Bertrand and Klein (2021), although research evidence is available on the reduction of information asymmetry from a microeconomic perspective (primarily based on firm characteristics), much less is known regarding macroeconomic determinants, particularly the legal and informational environment. Credit databases facilitate information acquisition to supplement ad hoc information gathered through relationship lending (Bertrand and Klein, 2021) and play a significant role in reducing information asymmetry. These credit databases are divided into two categories (Pagano and Jappelli, 1993). On the one hand, credit bureaus are private initiatives by companies to collect and sell information on potential borrowers. On the other, credit registries are public state or governmental initiatives aimed at providing sufficient information on borrowers.====In this study, our goal is to empirically investigate the impact of the presence, or absence, of information on borrowers’ discouragement. More specifically, we rely on a rich dataset to assess the effect of creditor information, credit bureaus and credit registries on the probability of being discouraged. Our contribution to the literature is threefold. Since credit bureaus and credit registries aim at reducing information asymmetry, the first contribution of our study is its empirical testing of the theoretical predictions postulated by Kon and Storey (2003). Here, we attempt to elucidate the relationship between the availability of information, facilitated by the firms’ legal and informational environment, and discouragement. Our second contribution is our evaluation of the impact of additional or reduced opacity in the relationship. To this end, we investigate whether risky firms, firm size (small and medium) or the presence of alternative funding sources affect the correlation between creditor information and borrowers’ discouragement. Finally, our third contribution relates to the use of a rich dataset that enables us to accurately evaluate discouragement and the effect of the availability of information on candidate borrowers. Our survey-based dataset enables us to clearly identify candidate borrowers who have been discouraged from seeking credit.====Our study analyzes data from various sources, notably the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey (WBES) and Doing Business databases. The WBES dataset consists of data from a large firm-based survey conducted on a representative sample of international firms from more than 150 different countries from 2010 to 2020. This dataset enables us to clearly assess whether potential applicants have been discouraged in the sense of Kon and Storey (2003) based on their answers to a set of questions.====Our results confirm the predictions postulated by Kon and Storey (2003). We find that the availability of creditor information and the presence of credit bureaus or credit registries is significantly and negatively correlated with the probability of being discouraged. Our results also highlight a nonlinear and concave, i.e., inverted U-shaped, relationship between creditor information and discouragement, consistent with Kon and Storey (2003). When disentangling the dynamics of the relationship further, we find that creditor information is even more determinant for risky firms or small and medium-sized firms. We also conduct additional robustness checks, addressing other proxies for creditor information or discouragement, endogeneity, and self-selection bias, all confirming our findings.====Our study significantly contributes to the increasing stream of literature on institutional borrowers’ discouragement. Our study also contributes to the literature demonstrating the importance of the legal environment on bank behavior (Kirstein, 2002, Fernández et al., 2010) and, more precisely, on facilitating access to and transmission of information (Bertrand and Klein, 2021, Sundgren and Alexeyeva, 2022). Developing credit bureaus and credit registries clearly represents a positive externality for the lending industry, both from the credit demander’s and from the lender’s perspective. The development of such institutions can reduce both the opacity of transactions and the probability of discouragement for rational and irrational candidate borrowers, which in turn could lead to additional loan contracts and better resource allocation.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review and our hypothesis development. Section 3 describes the data used in the analysis. Section 4 is devoted to empirical analyses, while Section 5 presents the robustness checks.

Using synthetic control methods to match Miami with cities that exhibit similar pre-intervention crime patterns, we find the phenomenon comparatively increased property crime and murder rates; we also document weaker but suggestive relative growth in violent crime. Compositional features of the newcomers partially drive results; the disproportionately young, male Cubans’ characteristics highly correlate with illicit activity. However, the degree of prior incarceration and psychiatric institutionalization likely explains the majority of the observed effects. Given the group’s unique composition and the absence of rigorous screening, it likely constitutes the worst observed migration event in terms of public safety in US history. The Marielitos bear little resemblance to other groups of newcomers. Hence, it would be imprudent to use crime connected with the 1980 event we study to inform immigration policy.","Few events have garnered the breadth of coverage in social science as the Mariel Boatlift. This diaspora of approximately 120,000 Cubans from the port of Mariel into Miami began in April 1980 and continued until that October.==== The phenomenon famously fueled a debate surrounding labor market effects of immigration. Research began with Card (1990), who found the labor supply shock had no effect on the employment of low-skilled workers. In a reappraisal of Card’s seminal study, Borjas (2017) refined the original difference-in-differences approach. Namely, he applied matching methods to identify cities with similar pre-Boatlift labor market conditions as Miami; relative to these counterfactuals, Borjas found low-skilled workers’ wages in Miami fell considerably after the arrival of flotilla. This response ignited controversy among labor economists. Clemens and Hunt (2017) and Peri and Yasenov (2019) argued sample selection sensitivity drove Borjas’s estimates; accounting for compositional changes in the population – unrelated to the Boatlift – led both to arrive at Card’s result.====Despite the attention the Mariel Boatlift has received in the applied literature, no causal analysis of the effects of the refugee influx on crime exists. The absence of research on this topic is surprising for myriad reasons. For one, the link between immigration and crime was salient to Miami residents in the 1980s. The arrival of Cuban refugees coincided with a spike in crime rates, which local politicians and journalists quickly pointed out.==== Additionally, records reveal Fidel Castro exploited the flotilla as a means of ridding Cuba of its mentally ill and criminal populations.==== While individuals with such backgrounds would generally be barred from entry, political tensions between the US and Cuba virtually eliminated the option to deport undesirable newcomers. To exacerbate matters, federal authorities were both unaware of Castro’s actions and unprepared to interview Mariel Cubans.====Our paper addresses the gap between descriptive research on Mariel related crime and the relevant economics literature. Using Uniform Crime Reports (UCRs) compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), we quantify the effects of the Boatlift on several dimensions of criminal activity. To measure these causal impacts, we apply the synthetic control methods developed by Abadie et al., 2010, Abadie et al., 2015, Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003.====Our empirical analysis requires extensive crime data across a large set of American cities. Over our study period – 1970 to 1990 – accessible records suffer from miscalculation and missing data issues. While the FBI requests local law enforcement agencies to submit crime records on a monthly basis, some fail to do so. These agencies may send aggregated annual or semi-annual statistics. In other cases, individual months are missing. Leveraging archival works by Maltz and Weiss, 2006, Maltz, 2006, we carefully correct inappropriately aggregated and missing UCR statistics. Specifically, we interpolate missing and aggregated crime data based on records before and after the appearance of gaps and allocate data to individual months according to law enforcement agency specific crime distributions.====To ensure we make like-for-like comparisons between locations, we must precisely measure population levels to construct per capita crime estimates. While the FBI estimates agency level populations, it is well-known they are incorrect in non-census years. Use of these error-ridden data would add uncertainty to our estimates and could also potentially bias estimates if the Boatlift itself is not captured correctly in the data.====To overcome this hurdle, we apply a parsimonious linear interpolation method using updated US Census Bureau Data to correct for UCR population estimates.==== Specifically, we compute jurisdictional population weights in census years as shares of county populations. Then, we linearly interpolate jurisdictional populations with these weights. We take the product of the weights and county level intercensal population to construct jurisdictional population estimates. Since our units of analysis are metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and our agencies’ jurisdictions do not span entire MSAs, identifying accurate population data is integral to the validity of our per capita crime rates. These corrections coupled with the use of synthetic control methods enable us to estimate crime effects attributable to the Mariel Boatlift.====Our analyses indicate Marielitos’ arrival led to a temporary surge in violent crime and a long-term increase in property crime relative to similar MSAs. Murder rates, however, remain significant as other violent crime effects disappear; our preferred estimates indicate murders per 100,000 comparatively rose by 41.2% in the seven years after the arrival of the flotilla. While less persuasive, we observe a relative increase in aggregate violent crime rates of 43%–53% on average following April 1980, though this effect dissipates after five quarters. Our property crime and robbery estimates are more sustained; we find that these comparative measures grew nearly 25%–32% and 70%, respectively, and persist until 1990.====Several phenomena hypothetically confound our findings. Miami’s centrality to cocaine distribution between 1970 and 1990 is one such idiosyncrasy. However, the inclusion of drug trafficking proxies in synthetic control methods leaves our results virtually unchanged. Additionally, one could argue our population estimates undercount the arrival of Cubans and, thus, mechanically produce large crime effects. To address this, we show even the most conservative adjustment to the Miami population does not substantively affect our findings.====Additional support for our estimates comes from a placebo test borrowed from the difference-in-differences literature. Specifically, we drop data after the arrival of the flotilla, and estimate the associated results with an artificial Boatlift beginning in 1977. That exercise yields no significant differences between Miami and its comparators; therefore, it supports the internal validity of the natural experiment.====Accounting for migrant selection lies outside the scope of our project and the available data. Nonetheless, this is an unignorable aspect of the Mariel refugee crisis. Our results are at least – in part – driven by negative selection of Cubans. Marielitos were disproportionately young men with low levels of education; a segment of this group even held felony records by US standards. These features suggest the group possessed high proclivity for criminal activity. Back-of-the-envelope calculations that consider changes in Miami’s age and gender profiles induced by the Boatlift capture only 12%–14% of our estimates. Therefore, underlying propensity for illicit activity or immersion difficulties explain the majority of our effects.====Given the negative selection of newcomers, a lack of rigorous vetting, and a virtually non-existent resettlement process, there are restrictions on external validity. This case study does not capture features of more recent refugee and immigration waves. The Mariel Boatlift likely represents the worst observed event with respect to crime. We view this paper as a cautionary tale; policies should not be oriented around ==== phenomenon.",Crime and the Mariel Boatlift,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000503,17 September 2022,2022,Research Article,26.0

There was relatively little meaningful bargaining at these assemblies; rather, monarchs provided ceremony and spectacle meant to focus their leading men on their agendas.","Political economists and scientists who are interested in the emergence of representative political institutions in the Middle Ages will be familiar with the following narrative. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Western European monarchs addressed their needs for military and financial resources by assembling the leading men of their realms. The latter were drawn from the political powerful estates – bishops and archbishops (first estate), lay magnates (second estate), and prominent city burghers (third estate). Assemblies provided a forum for political bargaining within which the estates consented to taxes in exchange for various rights and immunities; and sometimes input into monarchs’ agendas.====The above-narrative is consistent with what Boucoyannis (2015) terms the ==== of representative assemblies.==== This model is “bottom-up” in the sense that subjects impel a ruler to the political bargaining table to commit him to acting in their interests.==== The most well-known illustration of the bargaining model is North and Weingast’s (1989) analysis of England’s 1688 Glorious Revolution. With encouragement by members of Parliament, William of Orange led a Dutch armada into the English Channel. By early February, he and Mary (daughter of Charles I) were joint monarchs. According to North and Weingast, the Glorious Revolution rested on a bargain whereby Parliament was granted powers to prevent the Crown defaulting on its debts and confiscating creditors’ property. As a result, England’s government was able to increase public borrowing dramatically.====The bargaining model is intuitive and appeals to scholars steeped in a “politics-as-exchange” tradition (Buchanan, 1987).==== Yet the roots of representative assemblies in Western Europe run much deeper than the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. For example, Charlemagne (King of the Franks; r. 774–814) would call together his leading men in anticipation of the campaigning season:====And centuries before Charlemagne, Julius Caesar (100 BCE-44 BCE) and Cornelius Tacitus (56 CE-120 CE) both described popular (i.e., all male freemen) assemblies amongst the Germanic barbarians. Among other things, early Germanic assemblies adjudicated disputes and also appointed officials to adjudicate locally (Young, 2015).====However, it is unclear how well the bargaining model accounts for the development of assemblies during the Middle Ages. Boucoyannis, 2015, Boucoyannis, 2021 puts forth an alternative model, motivated in part by the observation that strong monarchs tended to convoke assemblies in the twelfth- and thirteenth-centuries. These were kings who could compel their subjects – and, in particular, the most powerful of nobles – to an assembly. Boucoyannis’ ==== turns the tables on the subjects: the ruler impelled subjects to an assembly, towards gaining concessions to his demands.====In many ways, the compellence model is a better fit for the comparative evidence. As stated above, however, assembly traditions run deeper than the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In this paper I argue (consistent with Boucoyannis) that early medieval assemblies often had little to do with seeking consent; rather, they were largely about achieving coordination. Regarding modern ==== constitutions, Weingast (2005, p. 105) has argued that they can provide “a focal solution[…] so that citizens gain the ability to act in concert and police their government” (Weingast, 2005, p. 105; see also Hardin, 1989, Hardin, 1999; Ordeshook, 1992; Weingast, 1997; Hadfield and Weingast, 2014).==== Consistent with this, I argue that a medieval monarch could leverage an assembly towards coordinating his subjects around an agenda.====The ==== of assemblies put forth here is, like Boucoyannis, 2015, Boucoyannis, 2021 compellence model, a “top-down” tool of governance: towards their own ends, rulers use assemblies as a means to orchestrate collective action.==== However, Boucoyannis emphasizes “institutional layering” (2021, p. 18) and “the fusion of judicial with political and fiscal functions” (p. 25): monarchs gained by centralizing their adjudication functions in a forum within which they could regularize their tax demand.==== Alternatively, I emphasize the decrease in administrative costs associated with coordinating subjects around a royal agenda.====While the compellence and coordination models are complementary, I argue that the coordination model provides a better approximation to many assemblies in the early medieval era. Coordination and compellence, thus, are both prior to – and important to understanding – the relevance of the bargaining model in the later Middle Ages and Early Modern period. To wit, the institutions that later became ==== assemblies were initially top-down governance tools; but over time they often backfired and ended up providing a forum via which the ruled checked their ruler’s power.====This paper helps to inform recent research that exploring links between Western European assemblies and political/economic outcomes today (Bologna Pavlik and Young, 2020, Bologna Pavlik and Young, 2021). More broadly, our work is related to studies that show – outside of the Western European context – historical democratic practices are positively associated with democracy and rule-of-law today (e.g., Giuliano and Nunn, 2013; Bentzen et al., 2019).====Proceeding, I begin by discussing the (predominant) bargaining model narrative in section 2. I then discuss Boucoyannis’ alternative compellence model in section 3, discussing its relative strength as an account of High Middle Ages assemblies in Western Europe. I then turn to the coordination model in section 4. I argue that it offers a better account of many early medieval assemblies. To support that argument, I provide historical illustrative examples in section 5. Then in section 6, I emphasize that the relevance of the coordination and compellence models for the Early and High Middle Ages does not discount that of the bargaining model for the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern period. I provide some concluding discussion is section 7.",Consent or coordination? assemblies in early medieval Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000527,14 September 2022,2022,Research Article,27.0

Formally protecting an innovator’s IP rights leads to an environment that preserves and even enhances the incentives for innovative investment. In the absence of legal measures of IP protection, or parallel measures, individual strategies may also be necessary for innovators to mitigate their rivals’ ability to imitate their innovations, in order to preserve the profitability of innovative investments. Both social and individual IP protection strategies involve costly monitoring, inspection, and sanctioning systems, which may reduce the individual’s and social benefits of innovation. However, in some creative industries, it is often the case that innovators take little if any, measures to protect their creations, even in the absence of a formal IP protection system. This is because IP protection-related incentives to innovation are not as central in such industries as the traditional perspective would suggest (Darling and Perzanowski, 2017). When designing IP protection measures, knowing the determinants of an innovator’s “peace of mind” is fundamental, particularly when deciding whether to even have such measures in the first place, because the benefits of legal IP protection disappear when innovators themselves feel no need for them.====Creativity is at the core of innovation, playing a central role in economic and social progress. As various scholars (Dreyfuss, 2010, Dreyfuss et al., 2010; Darling, 2014; Dreyfuss and Ginsburg, 2014; Vaidhyanathan, 2017) have stressed, because knowledge is cumulative, making the innovation benefits exclusive to the innovator may have the paradoxical effect of limiting or decelerating the diffusion of progress in the name of promoting it. The idea that patents and IP protection may be unnecessary is not new. In fact, Raustiala and Sprigman (2012b) argue that imitation may even be a driver rather than a barrier to innovation. Thus, avoiding unnecessary IP protection becomes a major piece of information for the regulator. Therefore, it is important to identify those cases in which institutional or firm-specific IP protection measures are indeed unnecessary, so that the costs of monitoring, inspecting, and sanctioning imitators can be minimized, or even avoided altogether, when possible. As is the case in many creative and cultural industries, such as fashion, cosmetics, or furniture design (Raustiala and Sprigman, 2006), it seems that the protection of copyright is not as effective or attractive as might be expected, as it ensures neither the protection of the creator’s interests nor those of society as a whole. Conversely, in these industries, the non-application of copyright or other formal protection systems seems to be more beneficial in diffusing innovation. It does not matter unduly if the product is “copied”: the creators benefit from the diffusion of their innovation, as they have the advantage of the “first mover”. Moreover, as their products are heavily subject to fashion trends, by the time an innovation is copied it is often too late for the imitation to be trendy too. In this case, in the so-called ‘knockoff economy’, imitation becomes an engine that diffuses, rather than a factor that hinders, innovation (Raustiala and Sprigman, 2012a, Raustiala and Sprigman, 2012b). This raises the question of whether an IP protection system is appropriate or even desirable at a collective or individual level in the culinary arts, or indeed in other creative sectors. Therefore, the main research question addressed in this study is: what are the determinants supporting the lack of fear of imitation in an innovative creation process, like that of Haute Cuisine?====Based on a unique dataset obtained from an extensive survey among one, two and three- “starred” (Michelin Guide) Italian chefs, we explore the determinants of a creator’s “peace of mind”, which is understood here as a lack of concern about the imitation of their culinary innovations. The choice of Italian Haute Cuisine (HC) and the particular dataset focusing on Michelin-starred restaurants, allows us to isolate, at an individual level, this lack of concern about imitability, which can be regarded as one component in an entire chain of steps along the creative process.====Several determinants are identified. We confirm that the lack of fear of imitation and, thus, the lack of need for further IP protection, is associated with organizational strategies for the management of new ideas. Furthermore, the lack of fear of imitation is motivated by explicit measures and strategies aimed at product differentiation and client loyalty. However, the most robust effect identified in all models estimated, and in both samples, considered (full and 2–3-starred chefs only), is the chef´s perception that innovative creation is a spontaneous and individual-specific process. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the literature review, while Section 3 introduces the methodology used. Section 4 presents the empirical approach, followed by the results. Section 5 provides the conclusions and policy implications of our research.","Is it the firm, the innovator, or the innovation?

The imposition of fiduciary duties caused the price premium of units sold ==== sales to increase over units ineligible for ==== sale, as well as over units that, although eligible for ==== sale, are sold individually. In addition, this valuation effect is stronger for projects with especially severe agency problems as proxied by high ownership turnover. This legal reform also affects the general private housing market beyond the ","Relying on agents for guidance in crucial decision making is prevalent in commercial activities in highly specialized environments. Effectively delegating power is also critical for controlling transaction costs when large groups are involved on either side of a transaction (Coase, 1960). Although agents can supply necessary professional knowledge and facilitate complex negotiations, they often harbor interests that may conflict with the well-being of those relying on their decisions, thus resulting in the now familiar agency problem (Jensen and Meckling 1976). Since the seminal studies of La Porta et al., 1997, La Porta et al., 1997, extensive studies have appeared on the relation between investor protection and financial market outcomes such as market breadth and ownership concentration. However, scant evidence exists regarding the valuation impact of specific rules granting this protection, which may offer important implications to policymakers and practitioners. The present study intends to fill this gap.====The greatest challenge to an empirical analysis of the value of investor protection may be lack of identification. This is due to: (i) this protection mechanism seldom changes in one jurisdiction; (ii) the cross-jurisdiction variation in market valuation can result from omitted covariates; and (iii) measurement of investor protection is itself subject to different interpretations (Spamann, 2010). To meet this challenge, we exploit a unique legal shock in Singapore that imposed explicit fiduciary duties upon the agents responsible for the collective sale of residential real property. Collective, or ====, sales in Singapore are an ongoing legal device, with decades of observable applications aimed at the convoluted issue of land assembly in urban areas for construction of new projects of higher value.==== In brief, ==== sales allow proprietors in the same residential development to initiate sale of the entire development conditioned upon supermajority approval. Therefore, the ==== sale price typically carries a premium over units sold individually, which unlocks the higher value of land for future development when sold together.====The feasibility of these sales, however, depends on delegating power to a small group of proprietors who form the ==== that conducts the sale on behalf of all the property owners. Despite the agents in this scheme also having principal interests as owners, agency problems may arise when the sale committee members derive private benefits from the sale, as may occur in any delegation of power. For example, a committee member under liquidity pressure may wish to place the entire project up for fire sale in order to obtain a premium, albeit lower than the premium obtained in a normal ==== sale. The costs of suboptimal ==== sale decisions fall on all homeowners, especially those whose reserve prices are higher due to home remodeling and renovation, location preference, or difficulty in financing relocation (====, elderly homeowners).====Customarily, Singapore courts deferred to the decisions of collective sale committees without extensively reviewing the decision-making process. As a result, these committees have benefited from long leashes: their members have had ample discretion without fear of challenges raised by minority proprietors. In ==== (hereinafter as ====),==== the Singapore Court of Appeal decisively imposed strict and clear fiduciary duties upon the collective sale committee to seek the best available price for the proprietors. This is a striking change in position from prior judicial opinions suggesting these committees not subject to fiduciary duties due to ownership status.==== In the Appendix A, we provide additional details on the legal position prior to the adoption of the new rule. This research exploits the exogenous judicial shock by applying the difference-in-differences (DiD) method to identify a causal relationship between the imposition of fiduciary duties and real estate market valuation. More specifically, we want to explore whether the introduction of fiduciary duties has increased premiums of ==== sales. Two key advantages can be obtained by using this case to ascertain the impact of fiduciary duties. First, the court decision deals exclusively with one major legal issue, ====., the fiduciary duties of collective sale committees. It thus obviates the disentangling effects of multiple rule changes that often arise following statutory amendments. Second, the decision negates a longstanding judicial position, which, interestingly, was reiterated merely five months prior in a different court decision. In a common-law jurisdiction like Singapore, a decision from the highest court that sets aside the view long held by lower courts and adopts a different legal interpretation is a definitive moment of law creation. Therefore, this shift of the legal rule entailed a significant shock for market participants.====Drawing on real estate transaction data from Singapore’s Real Estate Sale Transaction Database (REALIS) and hand-collected data for additional property attributes, we compare variations in ==== sale prices following the ==== decision, relative to individually sold condominium units and publicly subsidized quasi-private housing units, ====., executive condominiums (ECs). The physical conditions of ECs are similar to private condominiums; however, because they originated as public housing projects before transitioning after 10 years to effectively private status, they are not subject to collective sale within that period of time and the market generally forecasts the chances of their collective sale as unlikely.====The two benchmark groups of ECs and individually sold condominium units help us identify two different definitions of the ==== premium. Using ECs ineligible for ==== sales as the benchmark, we examine the ==== arising from eligibility for a collective sale. This definition of the premium is the main concern among economists and policymakers when they design market mechanisms. We predict that better investor protection from the institution of fiduciary duties can enhance investor welfare, and consequently the ==== scheme premium should increase after the legal reform.====We also test a second definition of the ==== premium using individually sold condominiums as the benchmark, which we term the ==== as per market conventions. Because condominiums are eligible for ==== sales, individual sale prices should also include expected ==== premiums adjusting for the probability of future ==== sales. For identical units sold ==== and individual sales, the ==== scheme premium should be the same despite the premium being fully realized in the ==== sale and only partially realized in an individual sale, depending on the perceived probability of a future ==== sale. Therefore, the ==== sale premium reflects a probability-weighted ==== scheme premium with the probability being one minus the expected ==== likelihood. If the expected ==== likelihood is a constant, then the two definitions of the premium would always be linearly correlated, in which case we only need to analyze one of them to reveal the common dynamic around our event. However, we expect that following the change in the law, the projected probability of successful ==== sales may decrease due to greater legal obstacles. Therefore, the effect on the ==== sale premium could be even stronger, reflecting both a higher ==== scheme premium, and a lower expected probability of successful ==== sales.====We perform difference-in-difference estimations for the two definitions of ==== premium separately, controlling for commonly used project and unit characteristics in the literature. We find that on average, the ==== sale has a price premium around 14 % points over sales of similar properties but ineligible for the scheme. This ==== increased to about 25 % points after the judicial confirmation of fiduciary duties, representing a significant change of about 78.6 % (11 %/14 %) from the pre-reform level of the premium. Consistent with our conjecture, we find larger effects of the law change on the ==== sale premium. The average ==== sale premium is 37 % points post the event, representing an increment of 85 % from the pre-event ==== sale premium of approximately 20 % points. Translated into Singapore dollar (SGD) amounts, our results indicate that an average homeowner would receive SGD$79,055 (approximately USD$56,468) more from ==== sales after the change in the law. These results are generally robust to alternative control variables of property features and various fixed effects.====Further, the conflicts of interest among owners affected by ==== sales mainly exist between resident owners and investor owners when the interests of the former are perceived to be sacrificed to lowball sale decisions by collective sale committees. Using property turnover rate as a proxy for the proportion of investment properties in a project, we examine cross-sectional variation in the law’s effect on ==== sale premiums. Consistent with the claim that fiduciary duties are applied as a legal mechanism to curb conflicts of interest, we find that the introduction of these duties has a greater impact on projects with higher turnover rates, in which residents, in contrast to investors, likely account for a smaller percentage of property owners. In fact, the results show that the interaction of project turnover rate subsumes the standalone effect of the law change, indicating the valuation effect occurs mainly on those projects with high turnover. This evidence also points to mitigated agency conflict as the main driver for the effect of the law change on real estate market valuation.====An important implication of this valuation impact from better investor protection is the spillover effect into the general market. Regarding transactions of private properties eligible for ==== sales, whether the law should increase or decrease the value due to two contradicting forces is unclear. On the one hand, better protection increases the ==== premium when a deal transpires. On the other hand, the perceived likelihood of ==== sales may decrease. Accordingly, the equilibrium result can occur in either direction. Overall, we find weak evidence of dominance by the effect from reduced probability. Although the price premium of condominium sales over EC sales decreased slightly following the law change, this effect is statistically insignificant. However, we find that buyers who intend to make the condominiums their residence are willing to pay 8 % more in the wake of the legal reform relative to purchasers who are engaged in the transaction for investment purposes. Moreover, the condominium turnover rate decreases significantly following the reform. Taken together, these results indicate greater participation by resident owners in condominium markets, consistent with mitigated agency costs in potential future ==== sales.====Our analysis to this point indicates that tightened investor protection from the institution of fiduciary duties benefits property owners and increases the collective sale prices. However, it is unclear whether the higher bar of ==== sales also leads to a potential hold-out problem by only a few owners, thus invalidating the original aims of this collective sale scheme. A complete welfare analysis should also measure the impact of the law change on deal-making costs and the total surplus from land redevelopment; therefore we examine the impact on the other side of the ==== sale, ====., the buyers, to shed light on the welfare discussion. Specifically, we conduct an event study to examine the law’s impact on publicly listed real estate developers’ stock prices. If tightening fiduciary duties represents only a redistribution effect on the rent previously extracted by buyers, we would expect the developers’ stock prices to respond negatively to the law. Moreover, the reduced likelihood of deals can further distress the ==== sale market size, resulting in negative valuation impact on public developers. Unexpectedly, we find that imposing fiduciary duties on collective sale committees brought positive stock returns to developers following the announcement. The average stock return on the announcement day is 5 % for all publicly listed real estate developers in Singapore with a t-statistic of 2.59. This positive valuation impact is robust to various event windows, the inclusion of developers listed overseas, and the use of risk-adjusted returns, thereby indicating that fiduciary duties are likely to enhance the overall welfare of both buyers and sellers engaged in ==== transactions. This enhancement in social welfare for both parties could, in turn, be due to a correction of a deadweight loss—====, litigation costs—in the old market regime that did not sufficiently protect property owners. Further, the enhancement of social welfare is consistent with the importance of secure property rights in market development.====Ours is the first empirical research study into the impact of the law on the ==== market in Singapore. The relevance of our findings, however, extends significantly beyond the Singaporean market. Although the Heller and Hills (2008) blueprint for the U.S. remains largely theoretical, similar schemes for the collective sales of residential property have become commonplace. Hong Kong was the first jurisdiction to employ such a regime in 1999 (Low et al., 2021). Mainland China has also adopted the supermajority voting scheme in its recent urban redevelopment experience (Chen, 2015), and similar schemes have been adopted in British Columbia, Canada, and New South Wales, Australia. For these jurisdictions, our research underscores the necessity of a meticulous assessment of the importance of judicial scrutiny over self-governance, which tends to be overlooked.====More important, we argue that the analysis of ==== sales in Singapore presents a close analogy to other forced sales, such as corporate M&A, that subordinate minority interests to the will of the majority. These collective sales are typically carried out by a group of agents who may apparently align their interests with their principals, yet still harbor significant conflicts of interest. Accordingly, judicial oversight is essential in guaranteeing the integrity of the decision-making process in these situations. Indeed, the fiduciary duties imposed on collective sale committees in Singapore are comparable to those borne by boards of target companies in Delaware: both are charged, in particular, with the obligation to sell their respective assets at the best available price. Although the vast majority of fiduciary duty suits are filed in relation to M&A (Thompson and Thomas 2012), the extant empirical research on fiduciary duties does not adequately address these transactions.==== In the M&A literature, much has been written on specific legal arrangements including poison pills (====, Comment and Schwert, 1995), staggered boards (====, Bebchuk and Cohen 2005), or termination fees (====, Officer, 2003), that are ultimately subject to the scrutiny of fiduciary duties. However, extant studies that examine the effect of these duties ==== on transactions are surprisingly limited. A recent paper considers the impact of the ==== rule (Cain et al., 2019), albeit without a clear causal identification. To the best of our knowledge, empirical works investigating the causal link between fiduciary duties and the performance of M&A transactions have so far appeared only in one area, ====., freeze-out mergers, in which the findings are not conclusive (Bates et al., 2006, Subramanian, 2007, Jain et al., 2011, Restrepo, 2013, Restrepo and Subramanian, 2015). Given the similarity between ==== sales and corporate M&A, our research complements the research on the impact of fiduciary duties in M&A transactions, for which the relevant jurisprudence has changed significantly in recent years.====Finally, our research links to the broader discourse on the costs and benefits of fiduciary duties. The prominent debate on the contractarian nature of these duties in corporate law (Easterbrook and Fischel 1993; Romano 1993, Brudney, 1997) has recently been revived in the U.S. (Rauterberg and Talley, 2017, Molk, 2017), perhaps in part as a response to a surge of shareholder activism, as well as in part to the latest financial crisis. Proposals have been advanced to expand the application of fiduciary duties to activist shareholders (Shill, 2017; Anabtawi and Stout 2008), as well as to broker-dealers (Finke and Langdon, 2012, Kozora, 2013, Egan, 2017, Bhattacharya et al., 2018).==== However, empirical evidence arising from these new domains is even more rare.==== Our study augments this important discussion by presenting a concrete case of using fiduciary duties to mitigate the agency problem.====In the following sections of this paper, we will first describe the legal framework of ==== sales in Singapore, articulating the 2009 change in law and highlighting its similarity in deal structure to corporate M&A. We then introduce our hypotheses and explain our empirical strategy. Following the explanation of methodology, we present our empirical results.

A 2018 media release by the Committee for Sydney suggested that the vision for such a megapolis is part of a state-wide ‘regional economic development’ plan.==== The current plan is an extension of the 2016 ==== plan proposed by former Sydney Lord Mayor, Lucy Turnbull.==== In fact, similar ideas for urban development have been mooted since Federation (see Section 3).====The ‘six-city mega region’ plan is an example of a worsening population distribution between state capitals and regional Australia.==== The problem has been identified as follows:====Given these inequalities, it would be reasonable to expect a shift in the population distribution away from disadvantaged regions.==== The inequalities create a centripetal force that directs migration and immigration flows towards the capital cities and their metropolitan region. Australian States are becoming city-states because their populations are concentrated overwhelmingly in and around the capital city. Depending on which analytical lens we use, this urban concentration could be seen as either positive or negative. There is therefore tension between two perspectives, one focused on ‘economic efficiency’ and the other on ‘social equity’.====The economic perspective focuses on benefits from agglomeration.==== There is already ample evidence of benefits from the three mechanisms of agglomeration: knowledge spillovers, market transactions, and competition.==== These mechanisms create Marshallian as well as Jacobian benefits. The former comes from intra-industry knowledge spillovers that lead to the emergence of industry clusters.==== The latter focuses on inter-industry spillovers where the close proximity of different industries leads to innovation.==== Agglomeration creates economies of scale, ‘which stem from a highly qualified [labour] market, from spillovers that develop between firms that may or may not work in the same field, and from links between firms and their clients’.==== As a form of the sharing economy, the creation of megaregions allows for distributing the capital cost and maintenance expense of infrastructure projects, such as high-speed railway lines.==== Notwithstanding the benefits from agglomeration are not scale invariant. There is an optimal scale for megaregions because ‘an inverted-U relationship exists between agglomeration and the economy. Agglomeration can greatly promote regional development in early stages while leading to a decline in the regional economy after the agglomeration exceeds the limits’.====A legal ‘social equity’ perspective focuses on the limits of agglomeration. This perspective formulates spatial inequality as an infringement on the wellbeing of regional Australians due to their inability to influence government policies through the democratic process. As a result, agglomeration propagates regional imbalances. The issue stems from a centripetal force that is concentrating state population in the capital city’s metropolitan region. Using the theoretical model in Section 2, I argue that political accountability is resulting in a decline in state population distribution because this accountability is creating an incentive to provide different types of public goods that gives capital cities an advantage over the rest of the state.==== As this situation becomes aggravated over time, the same political accountability will split each state into two tiers; the megaregion tier enjoys a level of public goods much higher than that in the rest of the state. However, I do not use this model to critique the proposed megapolis. The difficulty is not with the creation of such megaregions per se, but with the governance of the remaining part of what is effectively a city-state to mitigate the limits of agglomeration.====I am cognizant, however, of other views that see my call for balancing the population distribution as dangerous. For example, researchers from the Garran Institute suggest that.====Seeing the development of regional Australia as a threat piqued my interest in taking a closer look at this issue. In this article, I want to limit the scope of my investigation to answering this question: what is causing the relative decline in state regional population? This is what I set out to answer using a law-and-economics approach. In Section 2, I explain the current problem with regional development through a theoretical model. The analysis suggests that population distribution worsens because of political accountability. Therefore, the model predicts that the centripetal force towards capitals will continue to strengthen over time. In Section 3, to explain the need for reform, I critique regional planning in Australia, including so-called city-deals.==== After explaining why historical planning paradigms are ineffective in creating balanced development, in Section 4, I propose considering section 111 agreements to bring about a balanced approach to population spatial dynamics. My intention is not to provide a complete blueprint, but to motivate a conversation as to the role of the ==== in a national approach to development.

We find evidence that affected family firms’ share prices reacted negatively to the passage of the law. Moreover, standard OLS regressions of operating performance suggest that family control neutralizes the positive effect associated with employee directors. A more sophisticated difference-in-differences approach shows that affected family firms experienced a significant subsequent decrease in their return on assets. Our investigations of board composition also suggest that family firms rely on avoidance strategies to offset the influence of employee representatives. Overall, this paper casts doubt on the efficiency of minority worker representation in the boardrooms of family-owned companies and thus cautions against a “====” approach to corporate governance practices.","Should employees sit on the boards of directors of their companies? Kim et al. (2018) report that out of the 117 countries that they cover, 27 grant board-level representation to workers to varying degrees. The most emblematic institutional framework (and the most investigated in the academic literature) is the German codetermination system, which requires 50% employee representation on supervisory boards when firms have more than 2000 employees working in Germany. In his recent essay “Capital and Ideology”, Piketty (2020) makes a flattering assessment of the German codetermination system and advocates for its generalization: “====” (p. 973). However, some empirical studies suggest that German firms subject to this employee representation requirement underperform (see, e.g., Gorton and Schmid, 2004 and Petry, 2018). For Jensen and Meckling (1979), the simple fact that codetermination is only implemented by law suggests that the mechanism is neither desirable for nor desired by companies and their shareholders (====, p. 474).====Mandates of some form of employee representation are ultimately a type of ==== prescription for boards of directors.==== This approach can be criticized if we accept that the structure, size and composition of a board are all factors that emerge endogenously in response to environmental contingencies and contractual equilibria in a company (Hermalin and Weisbach, 2003). Thus, any intervention by the regulator risks distancing the company from its optimal board structure. For illustrative purposes, the optimal board structure of a firm with dispersed shareholding may be very different from that of a company controlled by a significant shareholder. Imposing the same rule on the two companies could prove counterproductive.====In this paper, we investigate the corporate governance and corporate performance consequences of mandating a presence for workers in the boardroom. We question the ==== approach by distinguishing between family and nonfamily businesses. This focus on family businesses has three motives. First, family control is the most widespread form of firm organizational structure around the world (see La Porta et al., 1999 or, more recently, Aminadav and Papaioannou, 2020). Second, family firms have characteristics that distinguish them significantly from nonfamily businesses; the main characteristic is that power is not exercised by a single person but is in the hands of a group of individuals bound by blood or marriage. This specificity leads some authors to see the family firm as confronted with specific agency conflicts and therefore in need of a particular kind of corporate governance (Villalonga et al., 2015). In some countries, legislators seem to have integrated this family dimension; in Germany, for example, most firms (regardless of their size) are required to have a labor representation share of at least one-third on their boards. However, family firms with fewer than 500 employees are not subject to this obligation (Goergen et al., 2008). Third, it appears that family shareholders are relatively reluctant to appoint employees to corporate boards when they are not forced to do so by the law (see Ginglinger et al., 2011 for France or Gregorič and Poulsen, 2020 for Denmark, where employees have the possibility but not the obligation to be represented on corporate boards). To judge the legitimacy of this reluctance, it is worth investigating whether family firms’ performance is affected by the presence of workers on boards.====Our main hypothesis (which we elaborate on in the next section) is that the benefits (costs) associated with employees on boards are weaker (larger) in family-owned enterprises. In brief, we contend that mandatory worker representation is an institutional arrangement that is redundant in the presence of certain practices that family firms implement to meet workers’ needs. Proponents of mandatory worker representation claim that giving employees a formal voice in corporate governance is a means of securing the specific and nontransferable human capital investments that they make in their firms (Furubotn and Wiggins, 1984). However, earlier literature suggests that family blockholders are credible upholders of ==== contracts toward their employees given the family’s long-term presence in the company (Sraer and Thesmar, 2007). Consequently, imposing the presence of workers in the boardroom might be useless and irrelevant in family-controlled companies. This argument is consistent with Bennedsen et al. (2019) finding that family ownership and labor regulation (of which worker board representation mandates may be a component) are ==== for employment protection and governance mechanisms. Kim et al. (2018) show that workers in German firms with parity determination are protected against layoffs during adverse industry shocks but receive lower wages in exchange for this employment protection. Interestingly, this “lower wages–lower job insecurity” profile is the one that is offered by family firms to their employees (Bassanini et al., 2013). Ellul et al. (2018) observe that family firms (contrary to nonfamily-controlled companies) act as alternative insurance providers when governmental social security systems provide less insurance to workers. In summary, it appears that family firms do not need workers on boards to care for their workforce and honor their implicit long-term contracts.====The analysis of the relationship between employee board representation and firm performance is susceptible to various endogeneity issues. Among other biases, there is strong potential for reverse causality since higher performance makes it more likely that a firm chooses to place employees on the board (Fauver and Fuerst, 2006). To alleviate such concerns, we exploit the quasinatural experiment provided by the adoption in France of the law of August 17, 2015, on employee board representation (also referred to as the Rebsamen law).==== France offers an interesting institutional framework that lies between the German codetermination model and the U.S. and U.K. frameworks, where labor representation in the boardroom is absent. Historically, French firms were allowed a certain flexibility regarding the presence of directors elected by employees. Employee board representation has been minimal until recently, with the presence of worker representatives generally limited to state-owned and privatized firms (Ginglinger et al., 2011). The Rebsamen law greatly extended the range of companies covered by the obligation to have employee directors on their boards. In companies employing at least 1000 permanent employees in France or 5000 employees worldwide at the end of two consecutive financial years, one or two (for firms with 12 or more directors) employee directors must be appointed. These thresholds permit the use of a difference-in-differences design to analyze the causal effects of mandatory worker representation on corporate performance. We also believe that France is an ideal setting for our empirical investigations because it is the European country where family ownership is the highest (according to Faccio and Lang, 2002, 64.82% of publicly traded firms are family controlled at the 20% threshold). Another interesting feature of the French institutional setting is that French firms are not subject to any regulatory constraints regarding board size.==== This allows us to investigate potential adjustments to board structure following the arrival of employee directors. Assuming that employee representation is detrimental for family firms, one could expect such firms to, for example, increase the board size (e.g., by nominating various family members or family-affiliated directors) in the wake of the new regulation to reduce the formal power of incoming worker representatives.====We assess the effects of the new regulation in a sample of firms from the CAC All-Tradable index.==== We examine the short-term market response to the promulgation of the law with an event-study analysis and investigate the relationship between employee board representation and firm profitability (proxied by the return on assets).==== We find that the market reaction is significantly negative for family firms but nonsignificantly different from zero for the subsample of affected firms that are not family controlled. Our multivariate regression analysis suggests that firms that implement worker representation around the Rebsamen law exhibit larger operating performance than firms that do not. However, the positive effect of mandatory worker representation tends to disappear for family-controlled companies. Relying on a difference-in-differences approach with the treated (control) group consisting of firms that are (not) affected by the regulatory change, we document a significant decrease in firm profitability for family firms over the two years following the introduction of the law. Overall, our results suggest that the new regulation could be value destroying for family-owned businesses and tend to validate the hypothesis that employee board representation is not desirable for family-controlled companies.====In search of more in-depth explanations, we investigate the relationship between short-term market reactions to the promulgation of the law and the formal control that the family exercises over the firm. We show that market reactions are more negative when (1) the CEO is a member of the controlling family and (2) family excess control rights (i.e., the wedge between voting and cash-flow rights) are important. This result is consistent with the family business literature (see, e.g., Cruz et al., 2014), suggesting that family owners with strong attachment to their firms are likely to resist corporate governance arrangements favorable to workers. It appears that market participants anticipate future disagreements and inefficiencies in board functioning arising from the arrival of employee directors.====We also investigate family firms’ compliance with the new regulation through the lens of the time lapse between the adoption of the law and the appointment of employee representatives on the board. We believe that this indicator is a means of eliciting family shareholders’ preferences for employee representation. It is significantly larger in family firms, suggesting that family owners are very reticent with respect to workers’ entry to boards.====We attempt to dig deeper into other such “avoidance strategies” on the part of family firms. We investigate whether family firms adjust their board size and composition in response to the arrival of employee directors. We observe that unlike nonfamily firms, family firms tend to adjust their board size upward (which ==== reduces the formal power of the incoming employee director). We also examine the role attributed to the newly nominated worker representatives. While the French corporate governance code of listed companies (the AFEP-MEDEF code) recommends that one employee director sit on the compensation committee, we find that employee directors are significantly less likely to be part of this committee in family firms than in nonfamily firms.==== Examining board activity (proxied by the number of board meetings), we also observe that unlike nonfamily firms, the boards of family firms do not meet more frequently in the presence of employee directors. Finally, we show that family firms are very reluctant to appoint an employee director who is affiliated with a union. Such results are consistent with family firms anticipating the conflicts that could arise from an increase in employees’ formal power and attempting to avoid them.====Our article makes several contributions to our understanding of employee board representation. First, we complement the literature on the relationship between employee representation and performance and identify a key moderator (namely, family ownership). Previous literature has suggested that the effects of employee representation are contingent upon certain firm characteristics and are not evenly distributed across business sectors. Fauver and Fuerst (2006) show that employee representation generally does not significantly correlate with firm valuation but appears valuable in industries that are concentrated and require high levels of coordination with workers. However, no potential “family effect” has received much attention from financial economists.==== A notable exception is the study by Petry (2018), who obtains a result at odds with ours (i.e., he shows that employee board representation is detrimental to affected companies but notes that family ownership tends to neutralize this adverse effect). It should, however, be noted that there are only seven affected family firms in Petry’s sample, which makes any interpretation difficult. The wide prevalence of family-owned businesses in France alleviates such concerns. Second, a key distinctive feature of our study is that we focus on an institutional setting that mandates ==== changes in board composition (one or two directors versus parity for the largest companies in the German model, which has long attracted the attention of financial economists). Interestingly, we show that even such minor changes are not neutral and negatively affect some firms (at least those that are family controlled). Our study is among the first to evaluate—beyond valuation effects—how affected companies modify their governance in response to regulatory changes. We show that family firms adjust their board composition and tend to avoid the entrance of employee representatives into the compensation committee. The patterns illuminate differences in perceptions of the impact of employee directors and suggest that family owners expect the arrival of labor representatives to generate a suboptimal modification of board equilibria. Third, on the practical side, we believe that our results might be relevant for policy makers considering further expansions of employee board representation. Voices have been raised in opposition to the law, especially among family firm owners, 67% of whom believe that the arrival of employee directors would adversely affect their firms.==== Our results suggest that their fears have proven true and that mandatory employee representation could move family firms away from their optimal board design. Given that a 2022 government report will examine the possibility of increasing the number of mandated employee directors on the boards of French companies to three, we believe that our results are policy relevant and contribute to the debate about the (non)optimality of such regulatory choices.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys the literature regarding the impact of employee board representation. Section 3 provides institutional details on the French employee board representation system. Section 4 presents the data. In Section 5, we examine the compliance of affected firms with the law of August 17, 2015, and the impact of the latter on corporate performance. Section 6 investigates corporate governance changes made by firms with employee directors. Section 7 offers robustness tests.

We provide empirical evidence from college expansions in the US over the years 1974–2019 and implement a triple-difference identification strategy to compare the arrest rates of different age groups over time in counties that differ by their college expansions. The reduced-form results suggest significant reductions in arrest rates. The effects hold across main categories of crime and over a variety of specifications and a wide array of robustness checks. We utilize an event-study analysis and a series of placebo tests to rule out the problems of pre-trend and endogenous migration. We discuss the policy implications and potential social savings of college opening through reductions in crime.","Talks on crime prevention strategies have always attracted policymakers across countries and specifically in the US, a country in which relatively high rates of crime, incarceration, and prison have posed large costs to the taxpayers. Among OECD countries, the US has the highest prison population per capita, roughly 700 per 100,000 population, which is about 4.7 times the average of all other OECD countries (OECD, 2016). Studies estimate that in 2015 per inmate cost of prison systems added up to an annual average of $33,274 and was as large as $69,355 (Vera, 2021). This figure combined with annual arrest rates and relatively high conviction rates leads to considerable spending in criminal justice systems. In 2016, roughly 2.02% of US GDP was spent on public order and safety, approximately $378 billion (Knoema, 2019).====Education, on the other end, has been shown to operate as a crime prevention strategy and reduce crime, beyond and over its labor market returns and other social benefits (Åslund et al., 2018, Campaniello et al., 2016, Cano-Urbina and Lochner, 2019, Cook and Kang, 2016, Garces et al., 2002, Lochner, 2011, Machin et al., 2011). Education raises the opportunity cost of illegal activities by increasing wage rates and income, impose an incapacitation effect by reducing the time available to spend on street capital, and it may affect individual’s discount rates by inducing higher values for future benefits as opposed to immediate costs of schooling (Lochner and Moretti, 2004, Machin et al., 2011). The relatively high social savings associated with crime reductions of education have made educational promotion policies attractive tools for crime prevention strategies. However, most of the literature focus on high school completion or schooling raises induced by compulsory schooling. Very few studies investigated the effect of college education on crime.==== This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by evaluating the effect of college openings on crime rates of those in college enrollment age.====We ask whether college availability in the local areas of residence improves college attendance and whether it has a meaningful effect on crime rates or not. We show that college expansions indeed increase the likelihood of having a college education with larger effects coming from the opening of 4-year colleges. We then construct a triple-difference identification strategy to compare the crime rates of individuals aged 18–22, those in prime college enrollment ages, to crime rates of individuals aged 15–17, cohorts who probably were not affected by college availability, in counties that experienced an expansion to those that did not and over time. Using county-by-year-by-age level arrest data over the years 1974–2019, we show that college expansions are associated with lower arrest rates among individuals aged 18–22. An additional 4-year and 2-year college in the county of residence is associated with 13% and 7% reductions in property crime rates among individuals aged 18–22. Implementing additional analysis, we rule out that endogenous migration or changes in welfare spending could have confounded the estimates. An event-study analysis and some placebo tests also rule out the pre-trend in outcomes induced by secular changes of the counties. We show that these findings are quite robust and remain statistically significant over a wide array of specification checks, functional form checks, various subsamples, and even after controlling for neighboring counties’ cumulative colleges. The results also suggest some heterogeneity by per capita income. The effects of college openings could be more than 5 times larger in low-income counties than high-income counties.====Our work departs from previous literature in several ways. First, this is the first study to link college opening and crime in the US. While a small strand of the literature evaluates the correlation between having a college degree and committing a crime, no study has evaluated a causal path between college openings and crime. Second, previous studies mainly focus on the education-crime relationship at the lower tail of education and specifically schooling laws related to high school graduation. We add to this literature by quantifying the impact of college education on crime and revealing substantial social savings from having a college degree in terms of reductions in crime. Third, we add to the literature on the social benefits of education by showing the positive externalities of education.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review the relevant literature in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the data sources. Section 4 introduces the econometric method and discusses the endogeneity issues. In Section 5, we go over the main results, robustness, and heterogeneity analysis. In Section 6, we conclude the paper and provide a short discussion about potential social savings from the main results.","An ounce of prevention, a pound of cure: The effects of college expansions on crime",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000370,26 June 2022,2022,Research Article,32.0

Starting from the given preferences of the electors, different electoral rules may translate this gap into different outcomes in terms of parliament composition. To amplify or attenuate this gap results in generating a sort of gender representation bias. This paper investigates if and to what extent different electoral rules generate gender representation bias when translating votes into seats. It proposes a theoretical framework to capture the potential of an ==== to amplify or attenuate the voting gender gap. Then, using survey data and different indices of representativeness and governability, this paper provides empirical tests for the theoretical framework. Both the theory and the simulations indicate that majority systems magnify the gender gap while proportional rules are likely to reproduce it with minimal distortions.","The social sciences find that men and women differ from each other in several aspects. In particular, when examining political preferences today, women appear more socially oriented than men (Eckel and Grossman, 1996, Croson and Gneezy, 2009). In fact, women are found to prefer stricter environmental protection (Thalmann, 2004, Bornstein and Lanz, 2008), more market regulation, more public spending (Kaltenthaler et al., 2006, Migheli, 2014) and less competition than men (Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007). Furthermore, more than men, women prioritise policies that entail more public social spending (Lott and Kenny, 1999, Aidt and Dallal, 2008). When men and women are called upon to elect their representatives, these different preferences are likely ‘transformed’ into votes for different political parties (Box-Steffensmeier et al., 2004), with women, who are likelier than men to cast their votes for left-wing parties (Norris, 2005, Arzheimer, 2009, Tranter, 2011), engendering what the extant literature calls ‘political gender gap’ or ‘voting gender gap’ (VGG).====Besides determining the causes of the VGG, the goal of the present work is to take the existence of the gap as a starting point to analyse whether—and to what extent—different electoral rules mitigate or exacerbate the gap. Indeed, if men and women have different political preferences, they may want different governments (i.e. either left or right) at the time of an election. Alternatively, women may prefer more leftist governments, while men wish for majorities that are more rightist. The problem is that only one majority results after elections, and different electoral rules are likely to determine different compositions of parliament, starting from the same preferences. These procedures, which translate preferences into seats, may amplify the VGG, leading to an outcome in which the preferences of a gender are over(under)represented.====Under pure proportionality (PP), the elected parliament is a clone of the electors’ preferences, in the sense that each party receives a share of seats very close to its share of votes. However, majority systems reward parties that meet a large consensus while excluding the minor parties from parliaments. Bernauer et al. (2015) suggested that proportional systems are less likely to engender ideological incongruence between electors’ preferences and elected parliaments than those using majority rules. These incongruences include gendered preferences. The first relevant issue here is gender equality; to achieve equality, electoral systems should preserve the VGG when translating the existing differences into the compositions of elected assemblies. The second relevant issue reflects the fact that democracies should be designed to give voice to the different preferences of voters. Therefore, legislators should pay attention to the possible effects that different electoral systems have on translating VGGs from preferences to seats.====Using different indices of representativeness, this paper shows that different electoral systems reproduce the VGG in different ways. In particular, majority systems tend to amplify it, while proportional rules tend to replicate it with minor alterations. In this sense, the latter system engenders less gender representation bias in the electoral process than the former. One may argue that several individual characteristics, such as age and income, may affect voting behaviour, and thus constituencies might be divided into groups according to these variables. While this is certainly true because different categories of people have different needs (e.g. the elderly and the young), in most countries, gender entails a component of discrimination. Therefore, different political orientations of the genders—women in particular—may reflect the quest for political parties whose programmes aim at fighting gender discrimination. Of course, other groups are discriminated against because of their ethnicity or religion; however, they generally represent minorities whose votes are hardly able to modify the political representation of the dominant groups. Women are one-half of constituencies and share the same problems of discrimination worldwide—though to different extents. Consequently, the focus on VGG has not only received significant attention from the extant literature but represents a potential starting point for gender-equality policies. It is important to stress, however, that the VGG is not gendered; in fact, the disfavoured part of the constituency may be either male or female. The analysis presented in this paper does not aim at entering the debate on women’s representation and participation; rather, it takes the perspective of equality and equal representation of genders in elected assemblies, no matter the gender of the voters. Indeed, the concept of equality entails that no differences exist between groups (genders in the specific case). Therefore, reaching equality in representation also means solving the problem of female underrepresentation.",Lost in election.

Cerqueira et al. (2018) exploit socioeconomic characteristics of suicide victims in order to develop more refined prevalence indicators. They rest on location ,"There is a consensus that the spatial variation of the ratio of suicides committed with guns to total suicides is the best indirect measure of spatial variation of gun ownership. For instance, Azrael et al. (2004), Briggs and Tabarrok (2014) and Kleck (2004) empirically assess an array of measures to determine which has the highest Pearson’s linear correlation with survey data on the percentage of households with firearms. They show that the proportion of suicides committed with firearms is the proxy with the highest correlation.====However, this proxy has some shortcomings. First, because suicides are rare events, it is not very precise for low-population localities. Second, it ignores the detailed victim information commonly available in mortality data. To address these limitations, Cerqueira et al. (2018) exploit the socioeconomic characteristics of suicide victims in order to come up with a novel panel-based proxy for gun ownership. Specifically, they estimate a discrete choice model for the likelihood of committing suicide with a firearm controlling for the personal characteristics of the victims as well as location fixed effects. They derive the conditions under which fixed effects reflect gun prevalence in the geographic area where the suicides occur. Based on suicide data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, Cerqueira et al. (2018) estimate this proxy for every Brazilian micro region. However, there are no comprehensive survey data available with information on gun ownership in Brazil, so that they are not able to validate their proxy.====In this paper, we use US data to provide such an external validation. We assess how their proxy performs relative to the proportion of suicides committed with firearms. First, we estimate both indicators across states using mortality data from the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). We then compare their Pearson’s linear and Spearman’s rank correlations with the percentage of households with at least one firearm based on survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1995 to 1998, 2001, 2002, and 2004, which are representative at state level. We find that the panel-based indicators indeed map better gun prevalence across US states than the proportion of suicides with a gun.====After establishing external validity using US data, we further estimate gun prevalence across Mexican states. This is a relevant application because there is no representative household survey in Mexico with information about gun ownership at the state level. The best survey data so far come from a household telephone survey, with 1361 respondents, by Esparza and Hemenway (2019), who find that few urban Mexican households own guns.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides the theoretical justification for proxying gun prevalence by location fixed effects in a logit panel regression for the probability of committing suicide with a gun.

In this paper, we focus on this issue using traffic offenses data from neighboring courts in South-East France. First, we measure disparities for observably similar cases both at the extensive margin (type of sentences) and intensive margin (====) and find large differences in sentencing across courts. Second, we decompose those disparities between the influence of prosecutors through their procedural choices (simplified versus classical criminal procedures) and that of judges who always have the final word on sentences. While there is heterogeneity in the role of prosecutors between courts, we find that most sentencing disparities cannot be explained by the sole decisions of prosecutors.","Criminal justice officials face a trilemma in their daily work. They have to deliver equal justice for all citizens, tailor individualized decisions that fit the crime being judged, and process efficiently large caseloads of offenses. Given the equivocal and heterogeneous nature of such goals, there is room for judicial disparities both across and within courts in how cases are handled from offending to sentencing. Disparities can be explained by the preferences and constraints of two types of agents - prosecutors and judges - who essentially decide on: ====) which criminal procedure to use and ====) which sentence to impose.====In France, as in most judicial systems, prosecutors are responsible for upstream decisions in criminal cases. They choose whether to prosecute or dismiss new incoming offenses, and then select one of several criminal procedures to handle them. Judges then receive cases and can either choose autonomously a sanction type and a ====, or just validate the prosecutor’s proposal. Thus, sentencing disparities might result from both the individual decisions and/or mutual interactions between prosecutors and judges. However, to date, most studies have analyzed the decisions of those actors separately. For example, many papers have estimated the impact of judges’ characteristics like gender or ethnicity on sentencing, whereas other papers have focused on the impact of political affiliation as well as electoral incentives on prosecutors’ judicial behavior (Epstein and Weinshall, 2021).====In this paper, we study the production of judicial disparities across courts located in South-East France using a sample of 3400 cases of traffic offenses augmented with data on judges’ characteristics. First, we measure sentencing disparities for observably similar cases across neighboring courts, providing the first econometric estimates on such differences in France to the best of our knowledge. Second, and more originally, we decompose those disparities between the influence of judges and that of prosecutors using a mediation analysis approach (Imai et al., 2010, Pearl, 2012). This approach allows us to capture the indirect impact of prosecutors on sentencing disparities across courts through their choices of criminal procedures. Several important features make traffic offending the most interesting type of crime to analyze for our purpose.====First, traffic offenses are massively widespread and represent 42 % of all convictions in France, representing about 258,000 convictions in 2018. Second, traffic offenses receive a highly intertwined criminal treatment by prosecutors and judges, through the frequent use of “simplified criminal procedures” instead of classical procedures leading to a trial. These simplified procedures grant prosecutors the lead in sentencing, allowing them to make a sentence proposal that is later validated by judges. In practice, several prosecutors from the same court often work successively on the same case from arrival to conviction, limiting the role of prosecutor-level characteristics. Also, such simplified procedures limit judges’ discretion by capping the maximum penalty or by excluding certain sentence types like prison. Thus, in such cases, disparities can originate from the interplay between two decisional sources, upstream (prosecutors) and downstream (judges).====Third, traffic offenses are very homogenous, unspecific, and often victimless, making case-heterogeneity less of a concern as a potential confounder.==== In practice, French magistrates often make decisions relying on the same set of basic information as available in our dataset (socio-demographic information about offenders, type of offense, alcohol intake and criminal background). Fourth, the majority of traffic offenders are easily identified during police stops and guilt is often implied. As a consequence, investigation costs are usually close to zero and lead to a very high prosecution rate, which means a low sample selection of cases. Fifth, traffic offenses receive highly standardized judicial treatment using rules and guidelines that are often very explicit, although not made public. This usually entails a limited number of criminal procedures and sanctions. Yet, we observe significant and sizeable variations in decisions even for such standardized cases among neighboring courts.====According to our empirical analysis, sentencing disparities for observably similar cases are large from one court to the next, both at the extensive margin (type of sanction) and intensive margin (====). There are also large differences in the use of probation sentences as opposed to fines or in the amount of such fines across courts. These cross-court disparities prevail when we control for the characteristics of judges, in terms of gender and experience, and are robust to selection on unobservables. Then, we provide for the first time a decomposition of cross-court disparities between the role played by prosecutors choosing procedures (indirect effect) and the role played by judges making the final calls (direct effect) using a mediation analysis. There is substantial heterogeneity between courts. At the extensive margin, the indirect effect is negative and very low in three courts, but the court effect is never fully explained by the decisions made by prosecutors. We conclude that prosecutors have a rather limited independent impact on disparities when choosing between criminal procedures.====The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on sentencing disparities along with their underlying explanations. Section 3 presents the institutional context of traffic offenses in France and Section 4 describes the dataset.

This market has received very little attention from the academic ","Insider trading has always been a controversial topic, comprising both legal and illegal aspects. Although illegal insider trading is forbidden in most advanced economies, it may present some advantages to the overall financial market. A non-negligible proportion of scholars and practitioners argue that illegal insider trading would allow a more efficient market price adjustment as more material information would be considered. Including such private information could end up depicting a more faithful representation of a company’s real value (Leland, 1992) and serves the greater ambition of market efficiency (Carlton and Fischel, 1983, Dye, 1984).====The opponents to this practice and proponents of legal insider trading advocate that this widens the gap between insiders and outsiders by favorizing information asymmetry and reduce fairness (Manove, 1989, Ausubel, 1990, Fischer, 1992). This could lead to a lower level of capital available on the market, under the form of discouraged investors, and above all affect the capital markets’ integrity, one of the main focuses and preoccupations of many institutions, market authorities and professional organizations worldwide. For every winning trade conducted by a corporate insider upon material nonpublic information, there is an opposite losing party (Seyhun, 1986). Most often, those losing investors would be outside investors who do not have access to such information, and therefore are clearly being exploited by insiders. In markets where regulations are lacking or not properly enforced, outside investors are likely to flee from securities markets in favor of alternative investment solutions. Eventually, this would impact the companies themselves that would suffer from an increasing cost of equity (Seyhun, 1986). This latter viewpoint has gradually gained importance over the years as the increasing number of laws and regulations prohibiting insider trading worldwide can attest. For instance, Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) stress that of the 107 countries where a financial market is in place, 87 have proper laws and regulations regarding the illegal form of insider trading. However, no clear consensus has been reached yet, and this may take some time before a uniform and standardized stance is adopted globally because insider trading is not precepted the same away around the globe, as advocated by Huang (2006).====The main difference between legal and illegal corporate insider trading is related to disclosure. In most markets regulating corporate insider trading, in order to abide by the law, insiders usually have a limited amount of time to disclose their trade to the regulator. This mandatory disclosure aims at minimizing the existing information asymmetry between corporate insiders and outsiders as trades undertaken by corporate insiders are made public such that outsiders can act upon this information. Insider trading becomes illegal if there is no proper public disclosure of insider trades. As such, it is almost impossible to analyze illegal insider trading as, by definition, data is not available before any illegal insider has been detected and convicted.====Based on this definition of corporate insider trading, we contribute to the current literature by analyzing legal corporate insider trading in the Republic of Korea.==== Even though the current literature treating the topic of insider trading is quite extensive, there is, to the best of our knowledge, very few papers focusing on this very specific market. Based on several criteria, notably liquidity and market capitalization, Korea is still considered as an emerging financial market even though its economic strength is well proved (Cho, 2004, Thompson, 2013, MSCI 2021 Global Market report). A proper analysis of insider transactions in this market should hence lift the veil on its efficiency and the efficient dissemination of information. Korea presents interesting specificities as being one of the world’s first countries to implement insider trading laws and regulations with the adoption of KSEA article entitled “Regulation of Insider Trading” in December 1976 (Cho, 2004). Along with the U.S., to date, Korea is the heaviest regulator regarding insider trading. As such, investigating the performance of a strong, yet emerging, regulator seems of utmost importance. Additionally, it is nowadays the eleventh country in terms of market capitalization.==== The Korean market further presents some unique characteristics that cannot be found on many other financial markets. First, the market is dominated by large conglomerates to a much bigger extent than other markets studied previously. For instance, Samsung Electronics (ticker 005930. KS), the largest Korean company in terms of market capitalization, makes up for almost 35% of the country’s total market capitalization.==== Second, stock market investing has gained popularity among the Korean population these last years, and therefore the market is dominated by amateurs, novice investors. According to Korea Exchange statistics,==== stock trading volume amounted to 81 billion shares in March 2021 for a total value of KRW 576 trillion. Back in March 2019, these figures respectively amounted to 22 billion shares for a total value of KRW 187 trillion. This surging demand in the stock market can be explained by the growing influence of retail investors. In September 2020, retail investors represented 87.5% of the total equity value traded as reported by Korea Exchange. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this existing trend as retail investors only represented 51.4% of total equity traded in March 2020. Finally, our analysis grounds on a very detailed dataset provided by 2iQ which allows us to construct a granular analysis. Our final dataset is made of 21,110 transactions for 264 companies on an eleven-year period ranging from January 2010 until December 2020 with detailed information on insiders’ positions. As opposed to most studies in the field that consider only managers and directors, we are able to split the insiders’ group over four hierarchical levels. To the best of our knowledge, this sample is the most precise, long and large in research studies conducted on legal insider trading in Korea.====We build on Nivelleau De La Brunière et al. (2020) and Mazza and Wang (2021) and consider the main Korean publicly listed companies. We however do not restrict the focus on a particular index since it would limit our analysis of the market. All the firms retained for our analysis belong to one of the three following indices: Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (KOSDAQ) and the Korea New Exchange (KONEX). Our analysis is threefold. We first test the market timing ability of insiders by comparing their performance to the one obtained by randomly simulated outsiders who trade the same amount of time and the same quantities but at different moments. This first analysis is conducted irrespective of the insiders’ levels, assuming that the private information they benefit from is uniform across insiders’ positions. By replicating the analysis over six different holding periods (10 days, 1 month, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months), we find that the results are quite mixed as insiders sometimes rank in the right tail of the performance distribution and sometimes in the left tail. Some corporate insiders clearly benefit from an enhanced market timing ability, but this does not apply to all the insiders and all the firms as we argue that there is information asymmetry even amongst insiders from the same company. When comparing insiders’ levels between them, we find that top managers and audit-related positions significantly outperform the others, validating the information hierarchy hypothesis. The hierarchical level, and the resulting access to information, is hence found crucial. When we further compare the insiders by level to the random investor’s group, we find that outsiders are capable to outperform some insiders’ categories, advocating in favor of the fact that some insiders do not possess valid information to trade upon, while they might believe they do.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the current insider trading literature. Section 3 is devoted to a presentation of the data. Section 4 discusses our empirical findings.

Using survey experiments, we show that seemingly irrelevant facts may actually be informative of actors’ choices, which third parties can use to update their beliefs. Specifically, we show that subjects’ perceived severity and recommended punishment for offenses are significantly increasing in the number of lawyers representing defendants. However, once subjects are informed that the defendant was randomly assigned a specific number of lawyers, the significant relationship between the perceived seriousness of the offense and the number of lawyers largely vanishes. Thus, third parties in our benchmark analysis may be using the defendant’s legal team size as a proxy to update their beliefs regarding the nature of the offense committed, as opposed to being affected by irrelevant factors in forming judgments. This is because randomization makes it impossible for third parties to draw inferences regarding the nature of the offense committed by the defendant based on the number of lawyers. However, for some offenses, we find that increasing the number of lawyers raises third parties’ recommended ==== even when the number of lawyers is randomly determined, which is consistent with a psychological phenomenon called ‘luck envy’.","The fairness and equity principles prevalent in most justice systems suggest that similar offences ought to receive the same judgment and punishment regardless of irrelevant or incidental details. Nevertheless, an expanding literature finds that wrongdoings that violate the same ethical principles and generate equivalent amounts of harm are sometimes judged differently. In particular, judgments can be impacted by factors such as the origin (Spamann and Klöhn, 2016) and the moral character of the victim (Reich et al., 2020), the language in which observers are solicited (Hayakawa et al., 2017), and the creativity displayed by the wrongdoings of offenders (Wiltermuth et al., 2017). There is also some evidence of a relationship between the group of lawyers representing a defendant and judgments (Szmer et al. 2007).====One problem in this type of research is the difficulty in separating truly irrelevant factors from seemingly irrelevant factors. This is because some information may appear irrelevant to a researcher, even when subjects may be (implicitly or explicitly) using the information in a subtle way to update their beliefs about the choices of actors that they are judging. This creates the risk of over-attributing variations in people’s judgments to irrelevant factors. Here, we consider a setting to illustrate this possibility. Specifically, we investigate how the number of lawyers representing an accused person influences third parties’ judgments. Following recent scholarship in law and economics (e.g. Ben-Shahar and Chilton, 2016; Puig and Strezhnev, 2017; Olsen et al., 2018; Metcalf et al., 2020) and management (Croson et al., 2007), we conduct an experimental survey to investigate whether third parties form different judgments about people who engage in similar wrongdoings (i.e. violating the same ethical principles and generating identical harms for identical victims) based on the number of lawyers that represent them.====In our experimental survey,==== we present subjects with scenarios which are silent on how the number of lawyers representing a person accused of committing tax evasion and fraud offenses is determined. Responses to this survey indicate a significant and positive relationship between the number of lawyers representing an individual and subjects’ perceived severity of the offense as well as the punishment they deem appropriate for the offense. These results hold true in both the fraud and tax evasion contexts that we study.====Without further analysis, one may interpret this relationship as suggesting that third parties’ judgments are influenced by factors which are irrelevant to the nature of the offense committed. It is possible, however, that third parties use the number of lawyers representing a person as information that is relevant to their beliefs about some other unobservable facts which are related to the nature of the offense. Specifically, we hypothesize that third parties may assume that the accused individual may choose to hire different numbers of lawyers depending on the seriousness of their offenses. Because some third parties may not be well informed of the seriousness of the offense described, they may rely on the number of lawyers hired as a proxy of the seriousness of the offense and update their beliefs accordingly.====To investigate this possibility, we conduct additional treatments wherein subjects are informed that the number of lawyers representing a person has been randomly chosen. This makes it impossible for them to make inferences regarding the seriousness of the offense based on the number of lawyers. We keep all other aspects of these additional treatments identical to those in our benchmark analysis. This small change causes the significant relationship between the number of lawyers and the severity of the offense to largely vanish. This lends support to the theory that third parties, in fact, use the number of lawyers chosen by the accused as a proxy for the seriousness of the offense about which they are imperfectly informed.====Results obtained from our supplementary treatments highlight an additional interesting finding. Although the significant relationship between the number of lawyers and third parties’ recommended punishment for the offense of tax evasion vanishes, it persists to some extent in the context of fraud offenses. This type of behavior is consistent with a phenomenon identified in prior studies which we call ‘luck envy’ wherein people’s degree of altruism or spite towards another is influenced by whether that person has achieved his/her position through mere chance. Thus, our finding suggests that luck envy may be activated only in some circumstances and not others (e.g. when the person commits fraud, but not tax evasion). Because the two offenses that we presented to subjects differ from each other in more than one aspect, which we discuss below, we can only speculate which of these aspects may be responsible for activating luck envy. Thus, our results indicate the need for studying luck envy more closely to identify the conditions under which it is likely to be a more prevalent behavioral phenomenon.====The broader implication of our finding is that some factors which affect third party judgments of accused people which are seemingly unrelated to the wrongdoing may, in fact, be used by third parties in updating their beliefs about the nature of the offense. Our specific finding with respect to the number of lawyers is important for defendants, particularly those who have a significant interest in protecting their reputation. Specifically, when evaluating the returns from legal expenditures, one must bear in mind a potential off-setting effect that may come about from inferences by juries as well as third parties regarding the seriousness of the underlying offense.====In the next section, we provide a brief review of the literature most relevant to our study and explain our main hypotheses. In 3 The experimental survey, 4 Additional treatments, we describe our main and additional experimental surveys, and present their analyses. In Section 5, we discuss the implications of our findings as well as the differences between two contexts (fraud and tax evasion) which may be responsible for the activation of luck envy.

This decline has been attributed, at least in part, to improvements in detection abilities due to new technologies (see Levitt, 2004). Yet, some crimes and offenses==== remain difficult (or too costly) to solve (for a review of the determinants of crime solvability, see Olphin and Coupe, 2019). For such crimes, policymakers often turn to incentive schemes that aim to elicit self-reporting by offenders through the promise of reduced penalties. By encouraging self-reporting, policymakers can gain several advantages, including the mitigation of harm (for ongoing crimes) and cost-saving on investigations (due to the early detection that comes with self-reports). Yet policies that incentivize self-reporting through reduced penalties inevitably involve a trade-off between ex ante and ex post efficiency. On the one hand, after an offense has been committed, a reduced fine creates an incentive to self-report (ex post perspective). On the other hand, before committing the offense, the possibility to attain a reduced sentence increases the incentive to commit the offense (ex ante perspective). The reason is that fine reductions in case of self-reporting carry an option value, as offenders will self-report if and only if they learn that the detection probability is high (Baumann, 2020).====We develop a theoretical model that starts by demonstrating this basic trade-off. The model entails two types of individuals—a “high” and a “low” type—who vary only in their benefit from crime.==== Both types know the expected detection probability when they commit the offense, but learn the true probability that applies to their case only after committing the offense. Specifically, we assume that after committing the crime, individuals receive a signal about their detection probability, which may be either high (detection is likely) or low (detection is unlikely). We assume that the high type’s benefit from crime is so large that he cannot be deterred from committing it.==== Still, he will self-report if he is offered a large reduction in the fine and the detection probability turns out to be high. Conversely, we assume that the low type’s benefit from crime is so small that he does not commit the crime unless he is promised a reduced fine in case of self-reporting. With these assumptions, the best outcome that the social planner can possibly achieve is that the low type does not commit the crime, whereas the high type self-reports. When this best outcome is unachievable, the social planner prefers to induce self-reporting by both types (over deterring the low type from crime) if the fraction of high types in the population is sufficiently large.====We then turn to our main contribution by considering the impact of loss aversion, which has been documented to be empirically relevant in many settings,==== analyzing its impact on the optimal self-reporting scheme seems important. Assuming that offenders are loss-averse means that they face an (additional) disutility when the outcome is below their subjective reference point.====Intuitively, loss aversion means that incurring a fine may be perceived as a painful loss, which, ceteris paribus, contributes to crime deterrence. However, it turns out that the impact of loss aversion is somewhat more intricate. Namely, instead of simply assuming a reference point of, e.g., the status quo, we apply the well-established approach of Koszegi and Rabin (2006, 2007)====—which originally deals with consumer choices—to the potential offenders’ decision-making. The following features are crucial for this approach====: First, the reference point is defined as the expected outcome from following a specific strategy. In our context, this means that reference points depend on whether or not offenders have in mind to self-report if the detection probability turns out to be high. Second, people cannot commit themselves to their own strategy. This implies that an offender might in principle switch from self-reporting to no reporting and vice versa after he has learned that the detection probability is, in fact, high. If such a switch is profitable, then the strategy is not incentive-compatible. Only incentive-compatible strategies constitute a so-called “personal equilibrium"" (""PE"") and may be chosen. From all strategies that constitute a PE, individuals then optimize by choosing their most profitable strategy, which is referred to as their “preferred personal equilibrium"" (""PPE""). The third important feature of the approach is that the degrees of loss aversion may well differ in different and separable domains. In other words, the decision-makers assess loss in each dimension separately (see Koszegi and Rabin, 2006, p.1138). Importantly, while subjects are loss averse, they are still fully rational in the sense that they anticipate their loss aversion at any time of the game.====The possibility of domain-specific degrees of loss aversion seems especially relevant in the context of crime deterrence. To see this, assume first that the benefit from crime is monetary whereas the fine is imprisonment. Then, there is no good reason to assume that the degrees of loss aversion (unexpected decline in monetary benefits or unexpected incline in years in prison) are the same. The same reasoning holds in the opposite case when the benefit from crime is non-monetary (for instance, keeping a stolen piece of art) while the fine is monetary. In cases where benefits and fines are both monetary, it seems reasonable to assume that the degrees of loss aversion are the same in both dimensions, so that we consider this as an important special case.====Our first result is that loss aversion reduces the minimum self-reporting fine required to deter the low type from crime. The reason is that, when the agent initially plans to self-report in case of a high detection probability, loss aversion creates two perceived losses when the agent learns that the true detection probability is indeed high: First, the agent incurs a perceived loss from the (reduced) fine itself because he initially assumed to pay no fine at all with some positive probability. Second, the agent incurs a perceived loss from giving up the benefit from crime after learning that the detection probability is higher than initially expected. Both effects lead to a reduction in the minimum self-reporting fine required to deter the low type. Had these been the only effects, loss aversion would indeed always be good news from the regulator’s point of view because offenders would come forward even when the fine reduction is low.====However, for the high type, the analysis turns out to be more intricate, as his decision is not about committing the crime at all (which he will do anyway by assumption), but about self-reporting. We show that the high type might be less willing to self-report compared to standard neoclassical preferences if loss aversion in the benefit dimension is more important to the offender than in the fine dimension.====Note that a high degree of loss aversion in the benefit domain resembles the initial notion of the endowment effect (Knetsch, 1989, Kahneman et al., 1990: a well-documented behavioral phenomenon, where people value an item more once they own it, as they get attached to it (see also Koszegi and Rabin, 2007, p. 1049). Losing the item (here, by self-reporting) then invokes a perceived loss.====The contribution of our paper is twofold. First and most specifically, it seems to be the first to consider how loss aversion influences the social planner’s optimal fine reduction for self-reporting. Second and more generally, while the emerging literature on behavioral Law & Economics has given some thought to the relationship between loss aversion and deterrence, we are unaware of any formal analysis that applies the Koszegi and Rabin (2006, 2007) approach directly to deterrence.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature. In section 3, we lay out the setup of our theoretical model. Section 4 derives our results for standard preferences. Section 5 extends to loss aversion, and section 6 compares the results for the two kinds of preferences. In Section 7, we discuss the potential impact of relaxing some of our assumptions.

We investigate how wiretap orders have been utilized in narcotics cases across the federal and state court systems. We characterize a sorting mechanism that is consistent with our data and empirical findings, whereby federal wiretap orders trade off prosecution outcomes and crime deterrence more quickly than state wiretap orders. We also find that the intensity of surveillance in most states and years is at the lower end of the enforcement-deterrence trade-off, reflecting the high cost of running wiretap operations.","The interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication (henceforth, “wiretap”) is one of the most intrusive investigative methods in a criminal justice system, and tends to be carefully guarded by judicial systems. Constitutions, laws, and judges often aim to protect citizens’ privacy while maintaining a level of security to deter crime. In the United States, the system of federalism allows a state court’s civil and criminal procedures to diverge from those of federal courts Linde (2005). That is, while both federal and state laws are designed to ensure the protection of individuals’ privacy and Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, the operational efficiencies and approvals to use wiretap operations may differ across court systems. Empirically, such differences across judicial systems have not been thoroughly examined. Both Title III and state wiretap statutes enable federal and state judges to grant orders authorizing wiretap surveillance under certain circumstances that pertain to “serious” felonies. Thus, law enforcement officers, including those at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), who conduct an investigation, can often choose to apply and obtain a wiretap order from either a federal or a state court. This is because attorneys for the federal, state or local government must work in conjunction with law enforcement agencies to prepare court orders for wiretap applications, based upon an affidavit provided by the agencies. As such, the prosecutors at the federal, state or local offices have some leeway in pursuing cases, as well as in seeking approvals for wiretap orders from federal or state courts.====For instance, for an FBI agent to obtain an order from a federal court, the agent must work with a United Stated attorney to prepare the application, which may then be selected for further review by the Department of Justice and/or the FBI. Alternatively, the agent may instead choose to work with a local (district) attorney to obtain a wiretap order from a state court, subject to further review by the state’s chief prosecutor, which may be a quicker and less burdensome process.==== However, the geographical scope of state wiretap orders is limited to the state’s jurisdiction. On the other hand, federal orders are likely to be more effective for prosecuting criminal suspects for cases that involve multiple states (i.e., larger cases). Another trade-off associated with using federal wiretaps is the larger costs incurred in comparison to the state wiretaps (Time, 2018).====Therefore, criminal cases will be sorted into the dual court system. First, we theoretically examine the sorting mechanism as well as a law enforcement agency’s choice of surveillance intensity, where there is a trade-off between prosecutorial outcomes (i.e., arrests and convictions) and crime deterrence (see, e.g., McCormick and Tollison (1984)): When deterrence effects are weak due to lower surveillance intensity, law enforcement can make more arrests and convictions as they increase their surveillance activities. However, after a certain point, the effectiveness of prosecutorial actions will decrease, as fewer individuals commit crime in the first place. We show that this trade-off is stronger for federal orders relative to state wiretap orders given their aforementioned characteristics, so the turning point of prosecution outcomes would occur at a lower level of surveillance intensity for federal than for state wiretap orders.====Second, we empirically investigate the properties of wiretap operations that go through each channel. Specifically, we examine the relationship between the number of individuals intercepted by wiretaps and the subsequent prosecutorial outcomes from issued wiretap orders, both measured in per-capita terms. Using panels of federal and state wiretap orders issued during 1998-2005 for all narcotics offenses (which comprise the vast majority of wiretap orders, over 80 and 70 percent, respectively), we find some empirical support for the above prediction. That is, the empirical relationship between prosecutorial outcomes and the rate of surveillance is indeed non-linear, first increasing and then decreasing after a “peak” or a turning point. Additionally, the estimates imply that the turning point of the relationship for federal wiretap orders occurs at around 1.3 persons intercepted per thousand population, for both arrests and convictions. On the other hand, the corresponding turning points for state wiretap orders are around 2.3 persons intercepted per thousand population, for both arrests and convictions. Thus, though more people are being surveilled (in per-capita terms) under state orders compared to federal orders, it does not necessarily follow that the surveillance rate under state orders is excessive compared to that under federal orders, because their respective turning points (and corresponding trade-offs) are different.====This is consistent with our theoretical model, which predicts that the arrest and conviction probabilities are higher for federal wiretaps (hence, stronger trade-offs) than for state wiretaps, because larger (smaller) scale criminal cases would be assigned to federal (state) wiretaps. On the other hand, we find that the wiretapping intensity in most state-year observations is less than the peak of the non-linear relationship. That is, while the observed surveillance rate is higher for state wiretaps than for federal wiretaps, relatively few people are surveilled in per-capita terms, considering the respective turning points for state and federal wiretaps. Hence, we find no evidence that overall either type of wiretap venue is being “overused” by law enforcement.====There is a sizable law and economics literature on the effects of policing and other sanctions on crime (e.g., Levitt, 1997, Klick and Tabarrok, 2005, Owens, 2009, Vollaard, 2013), to which our work contributes. Recently, Henneguelle et al. (2016) investigate the effect of electronic monitoring on recidivism, after the criminal has undergone reform and punishment. Similarly, Doleac (2017) examines the effect of state DNA database expansions on subsequent criminal behavior and finds that the higher chance of arresting outweighs the deterrent effect from DNA profiling. These measures are different from wiretap surveillance, in that wiretaps are performed as part of active crime investigations, and so they are not necessarily targeted for recidivism.====To our knowledge, there has been relatively little research on understanding how wiretap surveillance may influence criminal prosecution, despite the controversial nature of police surveillance. Atkins and Rubin (2003) show a significant increase in crimes following the Supreme Court’s imposition of the exclusionary rule (i.e., that courts may exclude from criminal trials evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment; see also Mialon and Mialon (2008)) because police officers would substitute towards less effective investigative methods. While they provide insights on how the Constitution may influence crime, our study is different in that we focus on the use of surveillance tools and prosecution outcomes, rather than the issues arising in the legal proceedings.====Finally, given the comparison between federal and state wiretap orders, our paper complements the literature on the optimal design of law enforcement within federations. For example, Garoupa (1997) offers a theoretical study of how the Schengen states can optimally combat drug trafficking across borders, but the coexistence of federal and local police forces was not directly explored. While the issue of federalism in legal scholarship pertains mainly to statutory interpretations, evidence at the operational level in parallel court systems has been relatively underdeveloped.==== Our finding of a lack of significant cross-effects between federal and state wiretap orders on their respective prosecution outcomes implies that there is some specialization of criminal cases at different levels.",State versus federal wiretap orders: A look at the data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000205,24 March 2022,2022,Research Article,39.0

Specialized courts have the advantage of efficiency, expertize, and uniformity (Baum, 2009). These advantages may lead to what is known as a “pro-patent” phenomenon, particularly in patent courts. It means that patent courts may encourage patentees to enforce their rights in the courts and favorably support their claims. As is argued by Landes and Posner (2003, p. 335), a patent court is more likely than a generalist court to “identify with a statutory scheme that it is charged with administering”. In this paper, we examine whether the IP courts in China show a propensity for pro-patent in their patent judgments.====The above issue is still under-explored in literature. In practice, several countries have established specialized courts at different levels, e.g., the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) in the US, the IP High Court in Japan, and the Patent Court in Korea, the UK, Germany, and Switzerland. However, there are very few empirical studies about the function of those courts. A few papers have empirically studied the effect of the CAFC since it began functioning nearly four decades ago (Cohen, 2005, Hall and Ziedonis, 2001, Henry and Turner, 2006). Yet, the CAFC is a national court that deals with appellate lawsuits, and there is a lack of empirical evidence on the function of specialized IP courts that deal with first-instance lawsuits at a sub-national level. This issue is not only important in the theories of patent protection and judicial specialization but also important for innovators who are relying on patents to appropriate.====We set China as our research context. The Chinese government decided to establish three specialized IP courts in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong in 2014; these provide a good foundation to investigate the functioning of specialized courts in the area of patents. Patent litigation data is collected from both IP courts and general courts in China, and we empirically compared the difference of patent lawsuits between the two types of courts to determine whether the claims of the plaintiff are supported by the courts and to what degree; whether the duration of the lawsuit differentiates; whether the judgment of the lawsuit is appealed.====We found that patentees sue for more damages by filing suits in specialized courts than general courts, and specialized courts grant more damages to the plaintiffs. Controlling the impacts of other factors by running regressions, we found no pro-patent propensity in the specialized courts, while the general court delivers more judgments in favor of patent holders than specialized courts. Moreover, patent litigations from specialized courts have a longer duration than those from general courts, and their judgments are more likely to be appealed and corrected by higher courts. We also found that litigious plaintiffs are to some degree disliked by the courts.",Do specialized intellectual property courts show a pro-patent propensity?

The expectation was that such consolidation would allow police to utilize its limited resources in a more flexible and efficient way. In this study, we investigate the impact of this reform on crime by exploiting the variation in the extent of police box consolidation across South Korea. Our estimation results indicate that the areas more strongly affected by the consolidation have experienced a notable increase in crime, especially sexual assault and assault. Moreover, we find evidence that the police box consolidation has had a disproportionately higher impact on crime in rural areas, where the distribution of police boxes was sparser than in urban areas. These findings suggest that varying allocations of police resources can have an important impact on crime, even without a significant change in the overall level of police resources.","Under the economic model of crime (Becker, 1968), additional police patrolling and presence should deter potential criminals from offending by increasing the probability of arrest and punishment and, thus, the costs associated with committing crimes. Many empirical studies support this theoretical link between police and crime by documenting that increased police presence and resources can lead to a significant reduction in crime (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995, Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004, Klick and Tabarrok, 2005, Evans and Owens, 2007, Draca et al., 2011, Machin and Marie, 2011, Mello, 2019.====Although the consensus in the literature is that increased police presence and resources can serve as an effective crime-fighting measure (Chalfin and McCrary, 2017), less is known about how police should allocate their limited resources to fight crime efficiently. For example, a regional police force may want to spread its resources within its jurisdiction, ensuring that all police beats are evenly supplied with police personnel and equipment to perform patrol duties. Alternatively, the police may want to implement a more focused approach, in which resources for several police beats are pooled to establish a larger police force in charge of fighting crime and maintaining public safety in a wider area. The former approach should provide most neighborhoods with easy and quick access to police patrols and services, whereas the latter should enable police to flexibly allocate their resources within the jurisdiction based on local criminal risks and potentially achieve economies of scale. However, as each approach provides a unique advantage, it is unclear a priori which approach will enable a more efficient use of the same police resources.====South Korea (henceforth Korea) provides an interesting empirical setting to investigate this research question. Traditionally, the National Police Agency of Korea (NPA) maintained the “spread” approach by establishing and maintaining a large number of local police boxes across the country. Police officers stationed in a police box performed several duties, such as routine patrol, public order maintenance, and conflict resolution. The presence of a police box also provided local residents with easy and convenient access to police services. For example, local residents had a platform to report crime victimization, emergencies, lost items, traffic accidents, and other public safety concerns. This traditional police box system helped police officers develop a close interpersonal relationship with local residents, which in turn improved the public’s trust in, cooperation with, and support for police. To a certain extent, the spread approach contains an element of community-oriented policing (COP), which emphasizes the role of community engagement and partnership as a key factor in the provision of public safety (Skogan, 2006, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, 2014.====However, in 2003, the NPA decided to switch to the “focused” approach, subscribing to the idea that consolidating small, understaffed police boxes into larger patrol stations should lead to more efficient use of limited resources. Under the spread approach, most police boxes could send out only one officer or two for patrol duties at a time, which potentially put them at risk of being outnumbered and made them ineffective against a large group of violent offenders. Pooling resources from several police boxes would alleviate this risk by enabling police to send out several patrol cars and officers simultaneously when necessary. Moreover, the consolidation of police boxes and their resources would allow police to provide a focused presence and intervention in high-crime areas (“crime hotspots”), resulting in effective crime control and prevention.==== The 2003 reform led to a major restructuring of the police organization in Korea. Over the next several years, many police boxes were closed down and their resources were consolidated to create patrol stations in charge of wider areas.====Based on the nationwide, district-level data on crimes reported to the police and the number of police boxes between 2000 and 2012, we estimate the impact of police box consolidation on crime using the temporal and spatial variation in the extent of police box consolidation across the country as an identifying variation. Estimation results indicate that the consolidation of police boxes had an important impact on local crime. On average, one less police box in a district (a 9% reduction from the sample average) is associated with roughly a one percent increase in local crime. The number of police boxes is negatively correlated with all five major crime types considered (murder, robbery, sexual assault, theft, and assault), and the relationship is statistically significant for sexual assault and assault. Our difference-in-differences analysis, which focuses on a narrower time period before and after the reform, also reveals a similar and significant empirical link between police box consolidation and local crime.====Moreover, we find an important disparity in the crime-reducing effect of police boxes between urban and rural areas, as the estimated effect of the police box consolidation on crime is disproportionately higher in rural areas. One possible explanation is that police boxes are more densely concentrated in urban areas, and thus, their consolidation has had relatively little impact on police visibility and accessibility. By contrast, when a rural police box closes down, its effect on police visibility and accessibility is likely to be more substantial, leading to a greater increase in local criminal risk.====Our findings contribute to the literature on the effects of police presence and resources on crime. A number of empirical studies provide evidence that increased police presence and resources can reduce crime by utilizing quasi-experimental variation such as a terrorist attack (Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004, Draca et al., 2011, changes in the terror alert level (Klick and Tabarrok, 2005), and an unexpected increase in government funding for additional police resources (Evans and Owens, 2007, Machin and Marie, 2011, Mello, 2019. Relatedly, findings from several well-known randomized policing experiments (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995, Braga and Bond, 2008, Ratcliffe et al., 2011 indicate that a visible increase in police presence and efforts often significantly reduces crime in areas with the high concentration of crime (“crime hotspots”) and may even lead to a reduction in the number of crimes in nearby locations (“a diffusion of crime-control benefit”).====However, holding the level of overall police resources constant, providing additional police resources in a small number of selected areas must lead to a reduction of police resources available in other areas, which may undo the crime-reducing effect of such a focused resource allocation at the aggregate level. Economic theory predicts that the geographic allocation of police forces and resources can have an important impact on the location and intensity of criminal activities within the police jurisdiction (Galiani et al., 2018), but empirical evidence on the crime-reducing efficiency of different police resource allocations remains scarce.====We aim to fill this gap in the literature by investigating the impact of the 2003 Korean police organization reform on crime rates at the district level. The nationwide reform in 2003 led to a substantial reallocation of police resources within administrative districts via consolidation of many police boxes, while involving little change in the overall level of police resources. Thus, evaluation of the effect of the reform on district-level crime rates provides a unique opportunity to better understand how different allocations of the same police resources may influence crime and public safety.====Our work is also closely related to a recent study by Banerjee et al. (2019), who investigate the optimal allocation of police resources in the context of a randomized policing experiment designed to reduce drunk driving in India. Their experiment involved the choice of sobriety checkpoint locations, which were either fixed in the one location or rotated among three different locations. Even after controlling for the intensity of crackdowns, the authors find that rotating checkpoint locations led to a significant reduction in night-time road accidents and deaths. In spite of several important differences between their study and ours, including the institutional setting (sobriety checkpoints in India vs. police boxes in Korea), study design (a randomized experiment vs. a nationwide reform in the police organization), and key variation (fixed or rotating sobriety checkpoint locations vs. variation in the number of local police boxes caused by police box consolidation), it is noteworthy that both studies find that a different allocation of the same stock of police resources can achieve fewer crimes and improve public safety.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background and Section 3 presents the data used. Section 4 describes our empirical strategy and presents the main results. Section 5 details additional empirical analyses to check the validity of our results.

The 2020 presidential and congressional elections cost $14 billion, a figure more than double that of the 2016 election.==== Meanwhile, the total spend on federal lobbying reaches another all-time high of $3.53 billion.==== Undoubtedly, American public firms and their employees provided much of this funding because they have deep pockets and face few barriers to doing so. For instance, the Political Action Committee (PAC) of Honeywell International spent $7.8 million in the 2020 election cycle.==== In 2010, the landmark Supreme Court decision on ==== reversed the corporate political spending restrictions, making it easier for corporations to influence the political process. In the meantime, however, it is rather difficult for shareholders to have a complete picture of firms’ political spending. According to a report by the ==== (CPA), less than 20% of S&P 500 firms had fully disclosed their “dark money” spending as of 2015 (Freed, 2016).====This issue has drawn widespread attention from investors in general, and especially institutional investors, who are increasingly concerned about Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure. Nowadays, many institutional investors are often “universal owners” with a substantial, diversified, and long-term ownership of public firms (Hawley and Williams, 2000a,Hawley and Williams, 2000b, Richard et al., 2011.==== Thus, it is in their interest to understand the ESG aspect of the firm while ensuring that the firm does not impose negative externalities and is sustainable. In recent years, a growing number of investors have been engaging with firms and voicing their support for enhanced ESG disclosure. Corporate Political Transparency (CPT) is a special category of ESG disclosure. Unlike most of the ESG aspects, such as the environmental aspect, it is hard to unambiguously conclude whether corporate political spending is good or not, both for the firm and for the wider society. On the one hand, corporate political spending has the potential to increase the competitiveness of the firm (e.g. Cooper et al., 2010, Eitan et al., 2013. If the goods or services provided by the firm are valuable, then these will eventually benefit the society. On the other hand, corporate political spending can be seen as a “risky” investment that could expose the shareholders to significant political risk (e.g. Aggarwal et al., 2012, Marco, 2020. Not only could the revelation of hidden political engagements result in reputational damage and public mistrust, but firms’ political connections could make them vulnerable to unexpected regulatory changes. Further, if the firm is engaging politically to pursue a personal preference or hidden agenda, then this could harm the social welfare in the long term.====The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is continuously considering the establishment of regulations requiring public firms to disclose their political spending. For example, in a 2021 speech Allison Herren Lee, SEC Acting Chair, said “Another significant ESG issue that deserves attention is political spending disclosure” and that “Political spending disclosure is key to any discussion of sustainability.”==== Contemporaneously, senators Chris Van Hollen and Robert Menendez are introducing the Shareholder Protection Act of 2021 which intends to mandate political spending disclosure and oversight.==== One central issue that remains unresolved is: Should public firms give shareholders access to the details of their political spending? Some argue that since firms’ political spending may not be in the best interests of the shareholders and could expose them to unexpected risk, firms should disclose this information (e.g. Bebchuk and Jackson Jr, 2012).==== Others argue that firms disclosing political spending to their shareholders would merely incur additional costs and place them at a disadvantage by revealing confidential corporate strategy.==== However, limited empirical evidence is available regarding the benefits and costs of CPT.====In this paper, we answer the above question using data on CPT shareholder engagements. Shareholder engagement refers to the process through which investors in publicly listed firms use their position as shareholders to influence corporate decisions (Tarun, 2013, James, 2019.==== In our context, we focus on CPT shareholder engagements where activist investors try to influence firms’ decisions on the transparency of their political spending. We are able to observe the CPT proposals filed by shareholder activists, as well as their outcomes. This allows us to investigate the following: Do shareholders perceive CPT to be increasingly important? Do activists succeed in achieving their objectives? Which firms do CPT activists engage? What determines the success of CPT engagements? To understand whether political transparency is favored by investors, we adopt a market-based approach by examining the stock market reactions to engagement outcomes. One major empirical challenge is the lack of archival information on when the engagement outcomes become publicly available. Using our hand-collected data on the outcome announcement dates, we answer the following fundamental questions: How does the stock market respond to the outcomes of CPT shareholder engagements? What factors can explain the stock market reaction? Given the important role of institutional investors in the ESG domain, we also examine whether institutional investors increase their holdings after successful CPT engagements.====We first provide the descriptive statistics of CPT shareholder proposals, the number of which significantly increased from 39 in 2006 to 64 in 2016. This suggests that investors are indeed becoming more concerned about the political transparency of public firms. Turning to the outcomes of shareholder engagements, although 85% of proposals do not succeed in achieving their objectives, 15% of proposals interestingly still make progress on improving political transparency. This finding contrasts the assertions in the previous literature that CPT shareholder proposals almost always fail (e.g. Bebchuk and Jackson, 2012, Yafit et al., 2016, JamesR and Margaret, 2016. This is because previous studies focus primarily on the proposals that go to shareholder meetings. However, most of the successful engagements in the sample are in the form of settlement agreements between shareholder activists and company management, where the company promises to make meaningful changes to its political transparency. Shareholder activists would thus withdraw their proposals before the meeting. This finding challenges the so-called “voluntary” disclosure of corporate political spending. Even in those cases where shareholders do not submit proposals to firms, the increased disclosure by firms might be a response to successful shareholder campaigns in peer firms. The increase in political transparency coincides with the rise in CPT shareholder engagements. This finding also echoes the behind-the-scenes intervention reported in the literature (e.g. McCahery et al., 2016) and shows that shareholder democracy can truly impact corporate ESG policies, such as political transparency.====CPT activists tend to target firms that have a corporate PAC. This suggests that corporate PACs, as an important channel through which firms partially disclose their political spending information, are influential in shaping shareholders’ perceptions about firms’ political engagement. The target firms have a higher percentage of politically connected directors, which is consistent with the view that political spending and board political connection are two complementary mechanisms of firms’ political engagement. The target firms also have weaker levels of political transparency, offering more room for improvement. Further, CPT is more relevant to shareholders if their firms are more sensitive to political uncertainty and thus face greater political risk. In general, such firms are more likely to be targeted. Interestingly, we find evidence of repeated engagements. Being targeted in the past positively predicts the target likelihood. This highlights the importance of CPT in the view of activist shareholders, as each campaign incurs a significant amount of effort and costs (Gantchev, 2013).====Conditional on being targeted, we further analyze which types of activist investors are more likely to achieve progress. We find that institutional activist investors are more likely to be successful. This is consistent with the fact that institutional activist investors have a superior ability to coordinate and obtain support from other investors to pressure target firms to approve their requests. One important question unexplored in the ESG activism literature is which types of institutional activist investors are more likely to succeed. The types of ESG activists are very different from traditional shareholder activism. The most prominent difference is the substantial number of engagements initiated by Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) funds. In our sample, SRI fund-sponsored proposals account for 27% of the CPT shareholder proposals. There are also some other non-traditional activists, such as religious investors and certain special interest groups. Using our sample of CPT engagements, we find that SRI funds are most successful within the realm of institutional investors. This finding supports the view that SRI funds are more experienced in providing ESG support to target firms, and that social value matters more to SRI funds than other investors. Public pension funds appear to be less successful than SRI funds, supporting the idea that public pension funds have less reputational concerns to pursue political transparency and suffer political conflict of interest. The political conflict of interest is especially relevant in our CPT context. In line with the view that labor unions suffer conflict of interest as they also pursue worker interests, we find that labor unions are least likely to achieve progress among institutional investors.====Turning to ==== implications, we first provide evidence that successful shareholder engagements lead to a significant improvement in political transparency. Using the CPA-Zicklin Index as a measure of political transparency, we find that the overall index of successfully engaged firms more than doubles (from 27.28 to 57.26) during the event year. This change is significantly higher than that for unsuccessfully engaged firms (from 45.93 to 55.22), both in the statistical and economic sense.====We next ask whether improved CPT enhances firm value or not. Disclosure resolves the information asymmetry problem, enables outside investors to discipline discretionary political spending, and could potentially enhance tacit collusion capacity. Meanwhile, disclosure is also costly and information on corporate political spending as part of firms’ strategies will be revealed to their competitors. To understand which effect dominates or under what conditions one dominates the other, we use the event study method to examine the short-term stock market reactions to shareholder engagement outcomes. Our approach has several advantages. First, the stock market aggregates and processes the information rapidly and incorporates it in stock prices. Second, we use the public announcement date, ensuring that the stock market participants are aware of the outcomes. Third, the result of the shareholder engagements is unlikely to be fully anticipated by the market participants before the announcement date. The greatest challenge for our analysis is the lack of archival data on the announcement date. To solve this, we hand-collect announcement dates for both successful and unsuccessful engagements from various sources. We find that the stock market responds favorably to successful engagements in politically active firms. The cumulative abnormal return (CAR) during the [-1,10] announcement window is 3.16%. A comparison of successful and unsuccessful engagements shows that the market reaction to successful engagements is statistically more positive. However, we do not find such an effect in politically inactive firms. This implies that CPT is more valuable in politically active firms.====We further investigate the channels through which CPT affects firm value. For politically active firms, the market reacts more positively to successful engagements when the market-wide political uncertainty is high. This is because the information asymmetry problem becomes more critical to outside investors as the political risk that firms are exposed to increases. This finding suggests that CPT creates value by eliminating information asymmetry on corporate political spending, which is particularly important in situations of high political uncertainty. Moreover, we also find that successful engagements lead to slower PAC expenditure growth in politically active firms, compared to unsuccessful engagements. With improved CPT, firms’ management is overseen by investors and thus is more cautious on political spending. This confirms the disciplinary effect of CPT. Additionally, CPT can facilitate tacit coordination among industry peers as communication on private information becomes more likely. Our analysis further confirms this by showing a positive ==== effect of successful CPT engagements on the profit margins of the firms.====Lastly, we examine how institutional investors, highlighted as an important category of investors in the corporate governance literature, react to the outcomes of CPT shareholder engagements. We find that, relative to unsuccessfully engaged firms, the institutional ownership of successfully engaged firms increases by 2.2% after the outcome announcement dates. Apart from existing institutional investors increasing their holdings, new institutional investors start to gain significant holdings in the firms in response to the successful engagements. These findings imply that institutional investors in general value CPT and are more concerned about the ESG aspect of the firm than retail investors (Elroy et al., 2015, Appel et al., 2016, Jie et al., 2019, Rajna Gibson et al., 2021.====Overall, we find that shareholder engagements help shape CPT, with our market-based tests providing empirical support for the positive effect of CPT, especially in politically active firms.====Our paper is related to the literature on voluntary disclosure. Early studies have examined the implications of corporate financial disclosure, such as management earnings forecast, annual report quality, 8-K filing frequency and content (e.g. Bipin et al., 2005, Feng, 2008, Biddle et al., 2009, Jing and Plumlee, 2020. A growing area of research has started to explore the implications of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) transparency, or related ESG disclosure (e.g. Yiwei et al., 2018, Beat et al., 2021. Our contribution to this literature is twofold. First, our study focuses on the transparency of corporate political spending, which is not the same as other ESG disclosures, such as disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions or human rights risk. It is difficult to judge ==== whether CPT is value-enhancing or not. Second, previous studies typically use the ESG transparency score, making it difficult to isolate the effect of ESG transparency. Our study adopts a different approach and analyzes the implications of CPT by examining the short-term market reactions to the outcomes of CPT shareholder engagements. By doing so, we alleviate the concern that other confounding factors could also contribute to the effect.====Our paper is also closely related to the literature on corporate political connections. Prior literature generally examines the effect of corporate political connection (e.g. Mara, 2006, Mara and Parsley, 2009, Cooper et al., 2010, Aggarwal et al., 2012, Yen-Teik et al., 2013, Alexander et al., 2015, Daron et al., 2016, Omer et al., 2016, Daron et al., 2017. The political connections studied are either firms’ political contributions to the political process, such as election and legislation, or firms’ board member political connection. One of the assumptions in those studies is that the investors are able to observe the firms’ political spending. In reality, as we show in this paper, corporate political spending is not transparent to investors. Our study thus captures this link that is missing in the previous literature. We show that, apart from the actual political connection, a lack of political transparency could expose shareholders to political risk. In addition, we provide evidence that political transparency could influence discretionary political spending.====Another related area is the burgeoning literature on active ownership. Research has documented the active role of investors in firms’ decisions and management, such as capital structure, business strategy, merger and acquisition (M&A), and general corporate governance. (Karpoff et al., 1996, Michael P, 1996, Sunil, 1996, Carleton et al., 1998, Diane and Hawkins, 1999, Gillan and Starks, 2000, Alon et al., 2008, April and Zur, 2009, Elroy et al., 2015, Appel et al., 2016. However, few studies have examined the impact of shareholder activism on CPT, which is a special category of ESG.==== This is surprising, given the importance of corporate political connection to firm value and the intense media coverage on the lack of transparency. Our paper therefore intends to bridge this gap.====The rest of paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines the institutional background. Section 3 develops our research hypotheses. Section 4 describes the data collected and provides the descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents our empirical findings.

When courts function in this informative way, the central government is able to improve the performance of lower level governments. After developing a general argument in that vein, the recent reforms to the Chinese court system are partially interpreted as an attempt to make the courts monitoring agents for the central government. Based on primary data from more than 1000 Chinese local courts, the argument is tested empirically and its hypotheses are largely confirmed.","To implement their goals, all governments crucially depend on the cooperation of lower-level governments, as well as on countless bureaucrats. To know whether these agents are doing a good job, governments need to collect reliable information about their performance. In this paper, we argue that central governments – beyond relying on monitoring mechanisms within the executive branch of government – might also rely on the judiciary to collect valuable information.====The provision of reliable information is a particularly sensitive issue in autocracies, because free elections are absent and the media are unable to freely criticize government. Autocrats also face what has been coined the “dictator’s dilemma” (Wintrobe, 1998). The conundrum is that even though a dictator would like to know how popular he is, the more repressive the regime, the more hesitant people are to reveal their true attitudes (see also Kuran, 1997).====After developing our argument that courts might be set up as agents to serve as a source of information, we ask to what degree the recent reforms initiated by the Chinese central government can be interpreted in this light. China seems to be a particularly interesting case for a number of reasons. First, it is one of the largest countries in the world, both in terms of landmass and population size. Its sheer size makes the central government’s information problem more acute than in many smaller countries. Second, China is one of very few countries having five different government tiers (Treisman, 2002). It thus faces multiple principal-agent issues that could be referred to as an entire “principal-agent chain”. This implies that lower-level governments may drift away from the policies and policy goals defined by the central government.====We analyze the recent reforms of the Chinese court system in light of our courts-as-monitoring-agents theory. Before the reforms, local courts essentially depended on local governments that determined promotions and court budgets. This is why local judges had few incentives to adjudicate against local governments. Local courts were also in charge of their own docket. If the courts refused to admit a filed case, they controlled not only their caseload, but could also make sure that politically sensitive cases were never tried. This also implies that the local courts produced little information valuable to the central government. If politically sensitive cases were excluded from the docket, or if decisions reached in accepted cases were influenced by dependence on local government bureaucrats, the local courts were not providing the central government with valuable information regarding the performance of the local government.====The reforms that began in 2014 led to two important changes that addressed these issues. Both the appointment and promotion of judges and the passing of the annual court budget is now a competency of a higher government level. In addition, it is now more difficult for local courts to refuse the admission of cases. The improved access to local courts and their independence from local governments leads us to hypothesize that the reforms will induce a higher number of filed cases, lower withdrawal rates from plaintiffs and a higher ratio of cases (particularly administrative law cases) won by the plaintiff. Indeed, all of these hypothesized results serve the ultimate goal of collecting valuable information from the populace on the behavior of local governments.====Based on hand-collected data from more than 1000 local courts, we find these hypotheses confirmed to a large extent. In particular, the number of administrative law cases sharply increased after the reforms were implemented, and the number of resolved administrative cases also sharply increased. After the reforms, there are also fewer withdrawals by plaintiffs during trials. However, the winning rate of administrative cases for plaintiffs has not increased significantly. The reforms can be considered a success for the central government that now regularly receives valuable information regarding the performance of its local governments.====Besides the fairly detailed analysis of the Chinese court system’s reforms, this study’s main contribution is to introduce a little-discussed function of courts, namely to serve as an information source to central governments. In Section 2, we describe traditional mechanisms used by central governments to monitor local governments, and then explain why central governments might rely on the courts as monitoring agents. Section 3 familiarizes the reader with the Chinese court system by describing its organization before the reform, the ensuing problems and the measures that were taken to mitigate these problems.

Initially the market is served by a single profession with a self-regulatory organization that sets the quality standard for all the members of the profession. We then introduce a second competing profession (e.g. solicitors vs. licensed conveyancers in England) and compare the market outcomes. It is demonstrated that with two professions the prices of the services fall and so does the quality offered by an average supplier. On the other hand, the total supply of quality might actually rise. When the market is served by two professional groups, then the quality of services offered by the higher-tier profession and the total supply of quality are increasing in the size and in the quality of the lower-tier profession.","Many of the services consumed in modern societies, such as legal services, are either experience goods or, even more frequently, credence goods. In the latter case the consumer can only evaluate the results of the service not the procedure itself (Darby and Karni, 1973, Dulleck and Kerschbamer, 2006). As a result, the markets for such services are strongly regulated, and the legal regime that is often applied is that of self-regulation (Van den Bergh, 2004). Under self-regulation, there is an organization of providers that sets the rules of conduct, oversees the process of joining the profession, and even takes some judiciary duties with respect to the members of the profession who misbehave (Abbott, 2014, Larson, 2013).====Governments often prefer self-regulation over direct regulation, as the latter can be difficult and costly due to the sophisticated character of professional knowledge (Van den Bergh, 1999,2004). On the other hand, the risk of self-regulation is that the profession will exploit its monopoly power by limiting entry and/or setting a quality standard that is not socially optimal (Shaked and Sutton, 1981a, 1981b, Shaked and Sutton, 1982, Willner, 1985, Donabedian, 1995). While professionals are expected to keep high moral standards, and to care about their reputation, historical and empirical evidence (see Johnson (2004), Dixon-Woods et al. (2011) or Fagan (2019)) and experimental studies (cf. Krawczyk and Szczygielski (2019)) suggest that at least some of them do not.==== An institutional solution that has been suggested in the literature (Ogus, 1995, Ogus and Carbonara, 2011), and implemented in some countries, is that of ====. Under this system more than one profession is allowed to operate in the market. Each of the professions is still self-regulated, but their regulatory practices may vary. One example of this system is in England, where since 1985 solicitors no longer have a monopoly for conveyance services: these can also be provided by licensed conveyancers; on the other hand, since 1990 solicitors can appear in all courts, a privilege once reserved for barristers (see Van den Bergh (2004) and the studies reviewed by Noailly and Nahuis (2010)). In Poland, for its part, the market for legal services used to be dominated by attorneys (Polish “adwokat""). However, over time legal counsels (""radca"") have gained an almost equal status.====To our knowledge, the only prior study that formally considered competitive self-regulation is that by Shaked and Sutton (1981a), who demonstrated that a market regime with two professional groups is socially preferable to one with a single profession. We compare the market with one profession and the market where paraprofessionals are allowed to operate as the second group of providers, but we also examine the relationship between the characteristics of the paraprofession and the market outcomes. Our inspiration is the model of credence organizations proposed by Baron (2011).====The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the benchmark model of a market with a single self-regulating profession. Then in Section 3 we present and solve a model with two professions. The analysis is continued in Section 4, which contrasts the markets with one and two professions, offers a comparative statics analysis, and discusses the applicability of the results under alternative assumptions. Finally, in Section 5, we formulate conclusions.",A model of competitive self-regulation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818822000011,13 January 2022,2022,Research Article,44.0

We consider models in which settlement occurs before and after the submission of binding offers, and in each we analyze costly discovery. Our results are compared to conventional arbitration (CA) which may be viewed as a litigation model. Overall, the incentive to invoke discovery is stronger in FOA than in CA, due in part, to informational rents often present in FOA, but not in CA. Moreover, submitted proposals under FOA contain information which raise the benefit of invoking discovery. FOA is a widely used procedure, including in the ====.","Final offer arbitration (FOA) is a widely used dispute resolution mechanism under which parties submit potentially binding proposals to an arbitrator. If the parties fail to settle, the arbitrator must pick one of the two submitted proposals and is therefore not allowed to split the difference. This unique aspect of FOA is not present in either conventional arbitration (CA) or a standard litigation setting. Moreover, in the presence of asymmetric information, the uninformed party may be disadvantaged in the proposal submission process relative to the informed party. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of a discovery procedure within FOA both because this may facilitate bilateral settlement (with an attendant reduction of dispute costs) and because it may alleviate the disadvantage of the uninformed party.====Because much of the data are public, Major League Baseball can help illuminate certain aspects of the FOA process.==== In 2021, J. D. Davis of the New York Mets submitted a proposal to the arbitrator for a salary of $2.475 million, while the Mets submitted $2.1 million. The arbitrator was obliged to choose one of these two submitted proposals, and in this case, it was $2.1 million proposal submitted by the Mets. The arbitrator did not have the option of splitting the difference. Carlos Correa submitted a proposal of $12.5 million, while his club, the Houston Astros submitted a proposal of $9.75 million. Because upwards of a month elapses between the submission of proposals and the arbitration hearing Correa and the Astros were able to continue bargaining in the face of these potentially binding offers. Ultimately they settled prior to the hearing at a salary of $11.125 million. This illustrates an important aspect of one of our models: Under FOA parties may be able to bargain and reach a settlement after the submission of potentially binding proposals to the arbitrator.====We develop screening models of FOA under which the uninformed party makes the final settlement offer. We consider both a model where the settlement offer occurs prior to the submission of proposals to the arbitrator and a model where this offer occurs after the submission of these proposals. We introduce costly discovery into both of these models and compare the incentive to invoke discovery across these models and also with a simple model of CA. The incentive to invoke discovery is generally higher in FOA than CA. One reason for this is that the uninformed party frequently pays informational rents in FOA. These rents stem from fact that the uninformed player submits proposals to the arbitrator which are suboptimal against one or both of the informed player types.====The key findings of this paper concern the incentives to utilize a costly discovery procedure across arbitration mechanisms. For each version of FOA we consider, we find that there exists a timing of the discovery procedure such that it is invoked under a wider range of values for the cost of discovery parameter than under CA. When settlement negotiations and discovery both take place prior to the submission of proposals, the incentive to use discovery is unambiguously stronger for FOA than CA. The reason is that the use of discovery in FOA eliminates informational rents otherwise received by the informed player. These rents are never received under CA.==== When settlement negotiations and the opportunity for discovery both take place subsequent to the submission of proposals to the arbitrator, discovery is invoked more under FOA than in CA. Because submitted proposals contain information, when confronted with a high proposal, the uninformed player has a stronger incentive to invoke discovery than in CA. The conditional probability that the player submitting a high proposal has a strong case is higher than the unconditional probability, and since costly disputes result against strong player types, this raises the benefit from discovery. In addition, in this configuration of the game, discovery can lead to 100% settlement even though it is not utilized in 100% of negotiations. One reason is that some weak players reveal their type by submitting a low proposal. Since their information is revealed by their proposal, costly discovery need not be invoked. Thus, 100% settlement is achieved at lower cost compared with other versions of the arbitration game where discovery has been invoked.====It is important to fully understand how FOA works, because it is such a widely used procedure. In addition to its use by Major League Baseball to settle salary disputes, it is also used by fourteen states to settle public sector salary disputes.==== In addition, New York uses FOA to settle disputes over out of network medical billing.==== Moreover, FOA is used to settle business to business pricing disputes in situations where at least one of the two firms has a good deal of market power. For example, FOA is used in disputes over freight rates on Canadian railways.==== FOA has been imposed as a condition for mergers in the telecommunications industry, including NBC-Comcast and Adelphia Communications and Time Warner.==== It has also been used in the Canadian telecommunications industry.====While FOA was proposed as a condition for the ATT-Time Warner merger, the Department of Justice criticized this proposal. This criticism centered on the issue of asymmetric information faced by multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs):==== “Video distributors are reluctant to invoke arbitration for a variety of reasons, including the existence of risk and informational asymmetries that favor Turner” and “Distributors must submit final offers without knowing what other MVPDs of similar stature and size pay to Turner”. Thus, asymmetric information is clearly important and should be incorporated into a model of FOA.==== Our models are consistent with the idea that, absent a discovery procedure, the uninformed party to the dispute may be disadvantaged in FOA relative to CA. However, a discovery procedure may reduce costly disputes and has some potential to reduce the disadvantage faced by the uninformed party under the FOA procedure.====Our model has both positive and normative interpretations. Analytically, there is not much to differentiate costly discovery from the costly acquisition of information outside of the discovery procedure.==== Thus, our results on discovery are of interest even when a formal discovery procedure is absent from the arbitration process. This provides a positive interpretation of our results. However, it must be noted that the presence of a discovery procedure may affect the cost of acquiring information as well as the types of information which are acquired in practice. Thus, a formal discovery procedure may produce outcomes which are distinct from costly information acquisition outside of such a procedure. If this is true, then the timing of such a procedure may be important.====The default rules for FOA do not include a discovery procedure, but, as detailed in “Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures”, discovery-like procedures are provided for under CA.==== Contracting parties may, at their option, incorporate these procedures into FOA. Our model suggests possible benefits from the addition of a formal discovery procedure to FOA, though perhaps one which is sharply limited in the types of information (e.g., prices paid by other MVPDs) subject to discovery. Thus our results can be interpreted as having important normative implications concerning the use and timing of a formal discovery procedure. Our paper provides insight into other normative questions as well, such as the choice between an FOA or CA procedure and the timing of proposal submission within the FOA procedure. Our analysis of discovery across these procedures can help inform decisions on how contracting parties can optimally design a dispute resolution mechanism.",Discovery in a screening model of final offer arbitration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000673,17 December 2021,2021,Research Article,45.0

Our model characterizes adversarial litigation efforts and the equilibrium investment in such efforts by both parties, subject to the value of winning and the costs of adversarial efforts vis-à-vis case-advancing ones. We find that litigation will always involve adversarial efforts if awards are sufficiently high, and that litigation in which most efforts are adversarial is a plausible scenario. Furthermore, in a relatively symmetric litigation that involves high awards, adversarial efforts increase the parties' likelihood of reaching a settlement agreement. In asymmetric cases, however, the existence of adversarial efforts inhibits settlement irrespective of the awards at stake.","By its adversary nature, a litigation process requires both parties to exert efforts in order to increase their probability of winning. Clearly, even relatively negligible events that occur during a trial force litigants to strategize: Whenever the defendant decides to invest costly resources, say, in order to file a postponement request, the plaintiff must correspondingly decide whether to dedicate efforts and file an objection. Once the plaintiff introduces a piece of evidence to prove an assertion, the defendant should determine the amount of resources she is willing to invest in order to rebut it.====Thus, by and large, any costly action taken in the course of a trial may be categorized as either a “case-advancing” one, i.e., an action one party takes in order to positively promote her case and increase her own likelihood of winning, or, alternatively, as an “adversarial” one—if this costly action has no direct impact on her own case and is taken only with a view to damage the opponent: lowering his probability of winning and thereby increasing her own.====Case-advancing efforts and adversarial measures taken by one party are not tantamount. Of course, both would raise her probability of prevailing relative to her opponent’s, yet each litigant’s decision on whether to engage in adversarial efforts and, if so, to what extent, hinges on her and her opponent’s value of winning, the strength of their cases if only case-advancing measures are taken, and, naturally, the cost of adversarial efforts. All parameters would affect both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s willingness to exert adversarial efforts in equilibrium.====Conceptually, we consider investment in adversarial efforts equivalent to ==== in contest theory (see Section 2 for an extensive literature review). Sabotage is highly prevalent in real world contest-like interactions (Deutscher et al., 2013, Chowdhury and Gürtler, 2015), and, as one would arguably expect, is ample under adversarial litigation rules. Adopting a contest-based approach to the litigation process, we may normally realize that any decision on whether to invest in a costly action is naturally comparative. So, for instance, even if the defendant is completely indifferent about whether to postpone a hearing to the next month, she may still be much better off by stubbornly objecting the plaintiff’s request to do so, primarily in order to damage his litigation efforts and force him to litigate under what he considers suboptimal conditions.====While this particular motivating example is a convenient way of conveying the concept of sabotage in litigation, such adversarial efforts are, in fact, much more widespread. Note, ==== action taken by one party may be considered ""adversarial"" as long as it originates, ====, in adversarial motives, rather than case-advancing ones, and weakens the opponent’s case. Hence, conducting media interviews, gathering evidence, requesting gag orders, subpoenaing witnesses, paying lawyers, dedicating time to rebuttals, or any other imaginable action that parties take throughout a civil trial may all constitute adversarial measures provided they are invoked merely for the sake of damaging the opponent.====Albeit an intuitive insight, the voluminous literature on the economics of civil litigation has consistently disregarded the distinction between case-advancing litigatory efforts and adversarial ones. This distinction is nonetheless of much importance to the understanding of litigants’ behavior, their expenditures in equilibrium, and the effect of asymmetry. Therefore, this paper is the first to comprehensively study the concept of adversarial efforts in litigation and the optimal (total and relative) investment in such strategy by the plaintiff and the defendant. Our results indicate that adversarial efforts always take place in litigation if stakes are high and imply, quite surprisingly, that litigation efforts may often be primarily adversarial.====A caveat is in order here. In contest-theoretic parlance, terms such as ""sabotage"", ""destructive efforts"" and others of that ilk, traditionally embed a normative subtext – they are socially undesirable compared to ""productive"" ones. To exemplify, consider workplace promotion tournaments in which the best worker (the one with the highest output) wins. Clearly, the firm benefits from workers' increased productive efforts that are due to worker-competition. However, the firm does not benefit equally if workers devote some of their efforts to sabotage – reduce other workers' output. Sabotage is therefore considered socially problematic, as it inhibits productive efforts.====In the litigation setting, by contrast, the term ""sabotage"" – adversarial efforts – would feature a different vein. Indeed, there is no reason to suggest that adversarial efforts in litigation are socially undesirable: the contest designer or society at large are not worse off when sabotage is exerted. This is due to the zero-sum nature of the legal process: efforts that aid the plaintiff harm the defendant and vice versa. Hence, while both our terminology and modeling technique are equivalent to those of contest theory for the sake of formal coherence and conceptual clarity, one must beware of the faulty deduction that any adversarial effort in litigation is somehow an affront to ethicality or social welfare. To plainly illustrate, observe a straightforward example: the plaintiff can invest resources in preparing her own witness (case-advancing efforts), or alternatively in refining her cross-examination plan to challenge defense witnesses (adversarial efforts). Either way, she will increase her probability of prevailing and reduce her opponent's, but importantly, those efforts are not conceptually identical – the plaintiff will not be indifferent in her decision concerning which type of efforts to exert. The present paper studies this very decision.====Structurally, we proceed as follows. Section 2 overviews the pertinent literature that conceptualizes civil litigation as a contest and pioneering rent-seeking works that focus on sabotage activities and destructive efforts. Section 3 presents the model that proposes to intersect both bodies of literature in order to yield an integrated theory of litigation with adversarial efforts. After characterizing the framework and unfolding the assumptions, Section 4 introduces our results by analyzing the equilibrium behavior of each party. Section 5 discusses the effect of adversarial litigation efforts on parties' willingness to settle. Section 6 compares our result to the classic Tullock (1980) setting.

This article presents an empirical demonstration of people’s loss aversion for the value of voting rights. By way of vignette experiments using scenarios of the 2020 U.S. presidential election (Studies 1 and 2, with U.S. citizens) and a fictitious direct premier election in Japan (Study 3, with Japanese citizens), the present research measured the willingness-to-accept compensation (WTA) and the willingness-to-pay price (WTP) for a ballot(s) in political elections. A great disparity between WTA and WTP was found regardless of the electoral setting, the proportion and width of ballot alteration, and the initial status. Specifically, the observed WTA/WTP ratios for a ballot(s) were within the range of 5.00–27.36, which is much larger than the ratios for ordinary market goods (about 1.5–2.5) and which is comparable to the ratios for other non-market goods. In addition, WTA for a mere 10% dilution of voting rights is still higher than WTP for full voting rights; the powerful effect of loss aversion might help explain universal barriers against suffrage extension.","This article explores people’s subjective evaluation of the value of voting rights. It empirically examines people’s loss aversion for voting rights. Loss aversion is a core element of the prospect theory, a theory of behavioral economics developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979). The prospect theory models that subjective satisfaction of people is determined by relative changes of their holding values rather than the absolute values they hold. The relative changes can be categorized into two domains, gains and losses, from an initial status (which is called a “reference point”). In a nutshell, people tend to be more sensitive to losses than gains even if the alteration width is objectively the same.====Implications of loss aversion for political decision making have been discussed from early times in various topics, especially in the area of international relations (Levy, 2003, McDermott, 2004). There has also been a growing body of research about voters’ loss aversion in their vote choice. For instance, economic performance reportedly has asymmetric influences on support for government and the incumbent—people react more strongly toward negative economic shocks than toward positive economic growth (Bloom and Price, 1975, Garz and Martin, 2020, Kappe, 2018). In a similar vein, negative attitudes of voters toward candidates have been found to provoke a higher voter turnout than do positive attitudes (Kernell, 1977, Lau, 1985, Patty, 2006). Furthermore, voters seem to have a general tendency to support the currently existing policy; in other words, people have a status quo bias from loss aversion (Alesina and Passarelli, 2019, Cohen and Knetsch, 1992). At the same time, it has been found that voters in the domain of economic loss tend to vote for a risky change, whereas those in the domain of economic gains prefer the status quo, a less risky choice (Carreras, 2019, for Brexit; Morisi, 2016, for Scottish independence; see also Quattrone and Tversky, 1988). However, all of these previous studies of voters’ loss aversion addressed vote choice and not the value of voting rights.====A method commonly used for measuring people’s loss aversion for a certain good is to observe the disparity between the compensation offered for obtaining it, the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) and the compensation required for losing it, the minimum willingness to accept (WTA). There is a phenomenon, known as the endowment effect, that WTA is higher than WTP. The prevailing theory for the endowment effect is loss aversion for the good (Thaler, 1980); accordingly, a loss aversion ratio is calculable as WTA/WTP (recent criticisms of this theory are noted in Section 5). For instance, to measure WTA/WTP for a mug, an experimenter gives a mug to seller-participants to ask them how much they would sell it for and to ask buyer-participants how much they would pay for it (Kahneman et al., 1990). A large body of research has revealed that WTA/WTP for ordinary market goods such as mugs is usually 1.5–2.5 (Booij et al., 2010, Novemsky and Kahneman, 2005). In other words, subjectively, people are inclined to value losses as 1.5–2.5 times greater than the equivalent gains in the case of ordinary goods.====The gap between WTA and WTP has been observed not only for ordinary goods. It has been observed for public goods and non-market goods as well. For example, goods such as hunting permits (Bishop and Heberlein, 1979), safety (Gerking et al., 1988, McDaniels, 1992), visibility (Rowe et al., 1980), and (to avoid drinking) distasteful drink (Coursey et al., 1987) have been studied empirically. Meta-analysis studies have shown that the ratios of WTA/WTP for public or non-market goods are higher than those for ordinary market goods (Horowitz and McConnell, 2002; Tunçel and Hammitt, 2014). This is probably because there is no guidance on prices. Evaluation of market goods can fall within a reasonable range around the commonly shared understanding of their prices; in contrast, people cannot rely on preconceived notions about their prices in the case of public goods or non-market goods. WTA/WTP ratios have varied largely by good and by study, but the average ratio for public or non-market goods has been around 10 (Horowitz and McConnell, 2002). Because no guidance exists for pricing, WTA/WTP ratios for voting rights can be predicted to be somewhat comparable to 10, as is the case with other public or non-market goods. It is predicted to be at least larger than 1.5–2.5, a range for ordinary market goods. Nonetheless, no research thus far has examined WTA/WTP ratios for the value of voting rights.====Actually, the value of voting rights is related to a long-standing controversial puzzle in political science, known as the paradox of voter participation. An act of voting has no material benefit for the voter, considering that an individual vote has no direct effect on the outcome of large-scale elections (as a practical matter, one vote cannot change an election outcome except for the extremely-low-probability event of an exact tie). Therefore, according to the rational choice theory (Downs, 1957, Riker and Ordeshook, 1968), voting is an irrational act for an economically rational person. From this perspective, voting rights could be worthless. However, the rational choice theory has trouble explaining empirical observations of high turnout rates for elections in reality (Green and Shapiro, 1994, Matsusaka and Palda, 1993). Consequently, studies have addressed voters’ subjective factors to explain the reality: there have been two lines of literature. One approach has been to expand the rational choice model by incorporating misconceptions of voters (e.g., Dittmann et al., 2014; Duffy and Tavits, 2008). This approach suggests that voters overestimate the effects of their own individual vote (i.e., the probability of being pivotal) on the electoral outcome. Another approach has highlighted the effect of voters’ subjective benefits for voting, such as expressive motives (e.g., Brennan and Hamlin, 1998; Kan and Yang, 2001) and moral duties (e.g., Blais et al., 2000; Güth and Weck-Hannemann, 1997). Such approach suggests that voters get satisfaction by expressing a “cheer” or “boo” for a candidate (even if the vote does not change the winner) or by fulfilling their civil duty of political participation to maintain democracy.====To date, however, very few studies have measured the value of voting rights. While previous research on the paradox of voter participation has addressed variables influencing voter turnout, the value of voting rights itself has not received attention. One exception is a study by Güth and Weck-Hannemann, 1997. They conducted an intriguing field experiment to measure the WTA value of a ballot for the German Bundestag election in 1994. In their experiment, participants (students) were offered a real incentive, payment in compensation, for destroying their actual voting card. But, because of budget constraints, they measured WTA of only a portion of participants who assigned low values on the ballot. In their experiment, 90 (63.38%) out of 142 participants refused to abandon their voting card even at the maximum possible bidding price, which was DEM 200 (≈ USD 130).==== In any case, previous research has not measured both WTA and WTP for the same voting rights.",Loss aversion for the value of voting rights: WTA/WTP ratios for a ballot,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014481882100065X,29 November 2021,2021,Research Article,47.0

This article examines Sander’s study and explains the reasons why second-choice analyses, and Bar Passage Study data in particular, are poor sources for causal inferences about academic mismatch. Sander’s paper makes indefensibly strong assumptions about the inferences that can be drawn between evidence on distinct types of mismatch, overclaims results that lack robustness across different subsamples of the underlying data, and misinterprets other results that in fact cut against the article’s claim. Ultimately, as originally reported in Ayres & Brooks (2005), the data do not provide evidence that affirmative action reduces the number of black lawyers.","Writing in ====, in 1994, Stephan Thernstrom described in stark terms what he felt were the likely consequences of “an unfortunate ‘mismatch’ between students and institutions” caused by “racially preferential admissions policies in higher education.”==== He argued that, rather than helping their purported beneficiaries, these policies set minority students up for failure by promoting them to schools otherwise beyond their reach. “Unable to stand the competition, many will not make it to the end; those who do obtain a degree will be heavily overrepresented at the bottom of the class and conspicuously absent from the top.” He was not the first to make this claim. Thernstrom cited Thomas Sowell (1972) as “one of the first scholars to advance this criticism [then] more than two decades ago.”==== Sowell in turn has pointed to “the late Professor Clyde Summers of the Yale Law School [as] the first person to explain, back in 1968,” the hypothesis:====that admitting black students to top-tier institutions, when they had academic qualifications that were at a level that fit second-tier institutions, meant that second-tier institutions now had a reduced pool of suitable black applicants and would have to dip into the pool of black students whose qualifications fit the third tier—and so on down the line.====At all levels, then, black students would be less credentialed than their white counterparts, causing a discrepancy that, it is often claimed or implied, will more than offset any benefits from attending a higher-tier school due to affirmative action.==== We are recalling here an old hypothesis, one that has been circulating for more than a half century, yet throughout this history, as Thernstrom wrote in 1994, “[w]e do not have systematic evidence with which to test many aspects of the mismatch argument.”====Cue Richard Sander’s (2004) “A Systematic Analysis of Affirmative Action in American Law Schools.” Based on a simple tier-index framework used to analyze data from the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC) Bar Passage Study (BPS), Sander (2004) argued that “a strong case can be made that in the legal education system as a whole, racial preferences end up producing fewer black lawyers each year than would be produced by a race-blind system.”==== That affirmative action suppresses the production of black lawyers (by 8% according to his estimates) was an extraordinary and admittedly remarkable claim,==== to which Ayres, Brooks and a number of other scholars were invited to reply (in the law review that published the original assertion) along with a response by Sander (2005).==== In an appropriate spirit of collaborative and rigorous exchange, Sander openly shared his data and program files with Ayres and Brooks, who did the same in turn. On careful review of Sander’s (2004) approach, Ayres and Brooks concluded that “a strong case” could not be made with his data and analysis to support a causal claim that the use of racial preferences reduces the number of black lawyers.==== Hence the title of Ayres & Brooks’ (2005) reply, “Does Affirmative Action Reduce the Number of Black Lawyers?”.====Ayres and Brooks observed that the conclusions from Sander (2004) rely upon several faulty assumptions, including the assumptions that in a world without affirmative action, white and black law students with the same LSAT and undergraduate GPA would become lawyers at the same rate and black law students would attend the same tier schools as white students with the same observable entering credentials. They explained that these two assumptions are not supported by the data, finding that “whites with similar credentials themselves go to a variety of different quality tiers” and pointing out that “[b]lack students are less likely to benefit from legacy preferences and are more likely to be financially constrained.”====It is important to recall the motivation and bases of critique in Ayres & Brooks (2005), which were not driven by skepticism regarding the theoretical possibility of affirmative action causing a detrimental mismatch effect on its beneficiaries, as Summers, Sowell and Thernstrom among others had long speculated. Indeed, it would be surprising if some sufficiently large degree of mismatch could not generate the effects that Sander claimed. Rather, Ayres and Brooks questioned whether Sander (2004) had, with his data, identified a causal effect of “academic mismatch” on the production of black lawyers. It was not simply the absence of a credible identification strategy that was troubling, but also the quality of the data themselves, which coarsened school-level observations into 6 rough tiers. Ayres and Brooks introduced their analysis of students that attended their second-choice school as an imperfect, but still more plausible identification strategy than employed by Sander (2004), while recognizing the continuing limitations of the data. “We make this point,” as Ayres and Brooks (2005) observed, “not as an indication of the quality of the analysis, but as a strong statement about the weaknesses of the data (for this question) on which we and Sander rely. We leave it to the responsible reader to make of it what she will.”====Given these constraints, Ayres and Brooks were cautious in constructing and drawing conclusions from their second-choice analyses. Sander (2005), on the other hand, who had then replicated their analysis and performed his own, was over-the-top exuberant in describing the findings as “stunning,” “striking” and “a nearly perfect demonstration of the mismatch effect.”==== Neither the caution expressed by Ayres and Brooks nor the exuberance betrayed by Sander in interpretating the analyses of bar passage data has changed over the past decade and a half. Yet, with “Replication of mismatch research: Ayres, Brooks and Ho” (2019), Sander sought to reopen the discussion on “academic mismatch theory” with a replication and critique of Ayres & Brooks (2005), which offered two alternative analytic approaches to Sander’s original analysis. In his replication and critique, Sander addressed both the second choice analysis and relative tier analysis from Ayres & Brooks, claiming that once modifications are made to these models, their results are supportive of the theory that mismatch between the academic ability of black law students and the academic rigor of their law schools has hurt the career outcomes of black law students.====Specifically, Sander points out that due to a coding error, Ayres & Brooks “mistakenly included in their sample” 109 students (in their total of 7212 observations) who should have been excluded because of missing responses on the key selection criterion.==== This was due to a genuine coding error, although not a “deliberate” one as suggested by Sander. Ayres & Brooks (2005) missed it, we will not now minimize it, and we thank Sander for bringing this to our attention. Correcting the code and running sensitivity checks,==== produces results that are neither qualitatively nor significantly different from those observed in Ayres and Brooks. As for the other so-called “actual errors” to which Sander points, these were in fact deliberate choices made and discussed by Ayres & Brooks to address their concern about the quality of the data and our confidence in causal inferences drawn from our empirical strategy. Sander proposes alternative choices that he finds more compelling (and we do not), yet analyses based on these choices are properly seen as robustness checks on Ayres & Brooks’s original findings. Sander’s robustness checks use different sub-samples of the BPS data and different definitions for assigning tiers in the relative tier analysis.====Since Sander (2019) is, at its core, a robustness check for Ayres & Brooks (2005), it can at most cast doubt on the usefulness of the BPS data for answering the question of law school mismatch—doubts that, as noted above, Ayres & Brooks previously raised more than a decade ago. Importantly, these robustness checks do not fundamentally change the conclusion reported in Ayres & Brooks and instead merely highlight their concerns about the reliability of the BPS data for answering questions about law school mismatch. When properly implemented and interpreted, some of the results that Sander (2019) holds up as indicative of the harmful effects of academic mismatch in fact contradict his claim. Other results presented in Sander (2019) raise concerns about the sensitivity of the BPS data to minor changes in sample selection criteria, but none of the results provide compelling support for Sander’s strong claim that affirmative action has reduced the number of black lawyers.====On the fundamental assertion advanced by Sander—that is, that racial preferences end up producing fewer black lawyers each year than would be produced by a race-blind system—we remain unpersuaded that the available data and methods allow causal identification. Bjerk (2019) outlines several concerns about Sander’s interpretation of his results and provides an explanation of some of the flaws in utilizing the BPS data for causal analysis. In the sections that follow, we discuss the underlying theory of mismatch, provide several critiques of Sander’s replication, present additional robustness checks, and expand upon several of Bjerk’s points.",Affirmative action ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000569,5 November 2021,2021,Research Article,48.0

This paper explores whether the correctional authorities in Washington State targeted certain ==== or other groups of offenders more than others in the process of making risk assessment decisions. Using a statewide sample of adult offenders and a set of controlled and uncontrolled regressions, I do not find evidence that the authorities targeted particular groups of offenders. Moreover, the authorities did not focus their attention on groups with higher recidivism rates, which is evidence against the presence of statistical discrimination.","The issue of discriminatory practices in law enforcement procedures is not new. It has attracted considerable attention since Becker (1957) introduced economics into the field of discrimination. Moreover, in the past two decades the topic has been revisited repeatedly with a special focus on police searches. This paper examines the possibility of discriminatory behavior in the criminal justice system—notably, the system of assessing offenders’ risk.====It has already been shown by Georgiou (2018) that the risk instrument used by the Washington State authorities to measure offenders’ risk was subject to manipulation, which consisted in artificially inflating certain offenders’ risk score so that they receive more hours of supervision in the community. The manipulation was conducted in an innovative and professional manner and generated superior predictive outcomes with respect to recidivism.====In this paper, I address the issue of whether this manipulation targeted some population groups more than others. Specifically, I compare different gender and race groups; I also compare offenders who were released from prison with those who were sentenced straight to the community (without first serving a prison term).====To answer this question, it is not enough to compare the rates at which different groups of offenders appear to be subject to the manipulation, which is known in the literature as a “benchmarking test” (Persico and Todd, 2006). Alternative “outcomes-based tests” have been proposed in an effort to unravel the true motivation behind potentially differential treatment of different groups.====Specifically, it is argued in the literature that, occasionally, even though a government policy violates fairness criteria, it meets other superior overarching objectives, in which case the violation is justified (Durlauf, 2006). The burden of proof lies with the proponent of the fairness violation. Such a consideration has to be taken into account when examining whether different offenders were treated differently. In the context of discriminatory behavior, it needs to be determined whether any seeming inequality in the behavior of the authorities can be explained by some “legitimate” personal characteristic or can be attributed to characteristics that are not “properly relevant” (Arrow, 1973), such as race, gender, or age. The former case is known as “statistical discrimination,” the latter as “preference or prejudice or taste-based discrimination,” or more simply, “animus” (Antonovics and Knight, 2009, Dharmapala and Ross., 2003).====Following the literature initiated by Knowles et al. (2001), I try to identify whether any seeming differential treatment of different groups is in line with inherent differences in their behavior, in this case their recidivism rate. The idea introduced by Knowles et al. (2001) is that “hit rates,” which they defined as the percentage of motor vehicle searches that ==== in identifying contraband in each group, should be equal across groups. If the hit rate for one group was higher, then the “police would always search these motorists, who would in turn react by carrying contraband less often, until the returns to searching are equalized across groups” (p. 206). The authors suggest that equality of hit rates in equilibrium would serve as proof of absence of animus, even if certain groups were searched more than others. Moreover, a low hit rate is taken to be evidence of animus against a specific group since the police can easily improve their success rate by searching specific groups less and turning their attention to groups with higher hit rates (Sanga, 2009).====This literature was further refined and expanded in the years that followed. Hernández-Murillo and Knowles (2004) have extended the model by Knowles et al. (2001) to incorporate identification methods that use aggregate rather than individual data. Dominitz and Knowles (2006) demonstrated that the model’s logic can be applied even if police are not motivated by hit-rate maximization but rather by crime minimization.====With respect to the specific findings, Knowles et al. (2001) showed that Maryland police do not display racial bias against African-American motorists, whereas Sanga (2009), who used a more comprehensive data set from the same state, reached the opposite conclusion. Similar cases of bias against minorities in motor-vehicle searches have been reported, for example, in Missouri (Hernández-Murillo and Knowles, 2004) and Florida (Goncalves and Mello, 2021), whereas Smith and Petrocelli (2001) paint a more nuanced picture of traffic stops in Virginia. Anwar and Fang (2006) and Antonovics and Knight (2009) suggest officer race as a parameter of interest and offer evidence that officers tend to search more motorists of a race that is different than their own. Dharmapala and Ross (2003) introduce the possibility of multiple equilibria and demonstrate that the existence of prejudice may vary depending on the equilibrium.====There have been attempts to distinguish statistical from taste-based discrimination in federal sentencing (Rehavi and Starr, 2014, Tuttle, 2019) as well as beyond the criminal justice system. Evidence of statistical discrimination has been noted in the context of game shows (Levitt, 2004), sportscard trading (List, 2004), and the U.S. rental apartment market (Ewens et al., 2014). More recently, the “ban the box” policy, which attempted to curb statistical discrimination in the labor market by delaying the revelation of information about an applicant’s criminal record, had unintended negative repercussions for ex-offenders (Agan and Starr, 2017, Doleac and Hansen, 2020). Finally, Bohren et al. (2019) proposed a theoretical model and empirical methods to distinguish between inaccurate statistical discrimination (which occurs when the discriminatory behavior is due to a mistaken belief) and animus.====In this paper, I examine whether different groups were affected differently by the manipulation strategy followed by the authorities in Washington State. In short, the main result of my analysis is the following: although I find evidence that certain groups were affected differently by the manipulation, I cannot say that this amounts to animus because, for the most part, the differential effect disappears once other factors are taken into account. In addition, it is hard to establish the presence of statistical discrimination, since any vestiges of discrimination that remain after controlling for all available factors are not enough to prove an organized attempt by the authorities to target groups with higher recidivism rates.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the factual background that surrounds the use of a risk assessment instrument in Washington State and provides some information on the mechanics of the instrument’s administration and how it fits into the state’s post-release supervision system. Section 3 briefly describes the data sets used, their composition, and their source.

Study of the internet echo chamber is one of the central research areas in the digital age, spanning multiple academic disciplines including psychology, communications, political science, economics, and law. Previous studies of the internet echo chamber have focused on political fragmentation and polarization in democracies (e.g., Sunstein, 2002). Such echo chambers feature confirmation bias, that is, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter efficiently sort people into groups of the like-minded, creating forums that amplify their already biased views (e.g., Sunstein, 2017). Less discussed themes in the literature are how internet echo chambers work within authoritarian regimes where information flows under greater restriction, and how information generated from echo chambers influences governmental decision-making.====The scenarios of an authoritarian regime and government decision-making are both important to the issue studied in this article. In autocracies, formal channels that allow a government to reliably collect information about public preferences, such as voting and polling, usually do not exist or are highly constrained. To maintain basic legitimacy and social stability, however, the government needs to respond to public opinion in many situations. To probe public opinion, government may rely more heavily on political expression on the internet. Online opinion, however, can be biased and extreme, repeating and reinforcing itself, and consequently conveying misinformation to decision makers.====In this article, I use judges’ perception of public support for the death penalty in China as an example to showcase the peril of the internet echo chamber in autocracies. The death penalty in China has long attracted scholarly and public attention, due to the large number of executions carried out by the state and the wide range of criminal offenses eligible for capital punishment. A very conservative estimate is that every year more than 70 % of executions around the world are conducted by China. It is also widely believed that the Chinese people overwhelmingly support the death penalty, and this alleged support is used as a major justification for why the Chinese legal system should retain its capital punishment regime. In practice, public opinion directly influences judicial decisions. On several occasions, the leaders and judges of the Supreme People’s Court of China (SPC)—the nation’s highest judicial organ, responsible for reviewing and approving all executions—have explicitly stated that the court would not have upheld an execution if there had not been overwhelming public support.====Surprisingly, although a remarkable collection of scholarly works, policies and judicial decisions have based their conclusions on public opinion, there has been very few studies that report a precise rate of public support for the death penalty. So how do decision makers collect their information about public punitiveness, and is their method reliable?====To answer these questions, I conducted a survey of 160 working Chinese judges. Recruiting real judges is certainly not an easy task, so this constitutes an unusual sample that not many past studies were able to gather. The data shows that, due to the lack of reliable channels of information, political expression online is these judges’ major source of information about public attitudes: when asked about their sources of information, 95 % of the survey subjects replied that they relied on social media and other online channels for public opinion, and only 6.9 % of them indicated they took large-scale surveys into account.====To test the reliability of online opinion, I further analyze the data drawn from a national survey, the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS).==== Designed to study a range of topics on Chinese communities, families, and individuals, the CFPS surveys a national representative sample of 31,664 people. In the 2014 study, it included questions with respect to experiences of political expression online, and individual attitudes toward the death penalty. Importantly enough, this was the first time we had a nationwide survey to probe public opinion about the death penalty in China. The CFPS data shows that those who voice their political views online are far more punitive than the rest of the population. In particular, the vast majority is silent. Of the total Chinese population, 98.9 % reported not expressing any opinion online on any political issues in the previous year. Only 1.1 % commented on political issues, and they are more punitive than the average: 76.1 % supported the death penalty, relative to 68.2 % among the silent majority.==== This difference is robust in multivariate regressions controlling for a wide range of factors such as respondents’ ideology, education, income, living environment, and experience of victimization. In Section 4.2, I will also explain that 76.1 % is very likely an underestimation of online punitiveness, because not all those who commented on political issues online expressed their views specifically on crime or the death penalty, and those who specifically commented on crime and the death penalty could be more punitive (or, extreme) because of the effect of the internet echo chambers.====The evidence suggests that public opinion expressed online is harsh and intolerant, and it also implies that those who rely mainly on information from the internet will likely form a mistaken perception of public attitudes toward the death penalty. Tellingly, the judges I surveyed seem to systematically misperceive public punitiveness. When asked about their perceptions of public attitudes, they reported a belief that about 78 % of Chinese support the death penalty, substantially higher than actual rate of 68 %. The rate at 78 % is more consistent with the online attitude – among those who express their political views online, the support rate is 76 %. To be sure, these results do not provide rigorous evidence on a causal relationship between judges’ reliance on online opinion and their perception of public punitiveness; I will also discuss possible measurement problems with respect to the way I surveyed the judges. Yet the current analyses do point to a potentially important problem embedded in the information collection and decision-making process of Chinese judges.====Together, the findings in this article help reveal the perils of the internet echo chamber in an authoritarian regime, and they also contribute to explaining why scholars and practitioners in China persistently overestimate public punitiveness in China. As the first national representative survey that reports public punitiveness, the summary statistics of the CFPS is enlightening in its own right. A support rate at 68 % does indicate that support is strong; nevertheless, the level of support is much weaker than what commentators have hitherto believed. Interestingly, comparisons show that this rate of support is even lower than that in some retentionist jurisdictions of East Asia that carry out far fewer executions, such as Japan and Taiwan. The rate is similar to that found in the United States in the 2000s and South Korea in the 1990s (Bae, 2011). Moreover, the majority of respondents (71.1 %) agree that the death penalty could be replaced by life imprisonment without parole. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, which I discuss in Section 5.",The internet echo chamber and the misinformation of judges: The case of judges’ perception of public support for the death penalty in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000521,19 October 2021,2021,Research Article,50.0

The motivation is the sequential nature of crime and punishment, which unfolds as follows: enforcers threaten punishment, offenders commit crimes (or are deterred), and enforcers (possibly comprising different decision makers) enact punishments. The cost of carrying out threatened punishments after the fact is what potentially undermines the credibility of the initial threat. The model shows that, given the sequential nature of the crime and punishment game, multiple equilibria are possible entailing different crime rates. Changes in law enforcement policy over recent decades are discussed in light of the results.","Enforcement of criminal laws is a costly enterprise that imposes a significant strain on the budgets of state and local governments. This cost is undoubtedly one of the factors that has motivated recent efforts toward decriminalization of certain acts, mostly drug-related, as well as the reduction of prison terms for many non-violent offenders, especially those repeat offenders who incurred lengthy sentences under three-strikes laws. An unintended consequence of these reforms, however, is the signal that it sends to future offenders regarding the commitment of governments to carry out tough laws (its general-deterrence effects). If would-be offenders perceive that overly stringent or costly punishments will not be enforced in the future, for budgetary or other reasons, then current crime rates will rise because threatened punishments will simply be viewed as “cheap talk.” And if the increase in crime overwhelms the system, it could precipitate a bandwagon effect leading to a spiraling crime rate.====On the other hand, if the government can credibly threaten to impose harsh punishments, thereby deterring current crimes, both the crime rate ==== realized enforcement costs may be lowered. Indeed, this paradoxical outcome is the “Holy Grail” of law enforcement; it was the quest for this outcome that presumably was one of the motivating factors behind the enactment of three-strikes laws by several states in the1990s.====The preceding logic focuses attention on the ==== of criminal punishment schemes as a crucial element of their efficacy. This issue, however, has not received much attention in the economics-of-crime literature, where it is usually assumed that the enforcement authority can commit to carry out any proposed scheme.==== The analysis in this paper takes this issue seriously by examining the implications of the credibility question.====We motivate the more detailed analysis to be developed in subsequent sections with the following simple law enforcement “game” played between a single potential offender and an enforcer.==== The offender’s strategies are to “commit” or “not commit” a crime, and the enforcer’s strategies are to be “tough” or “soft” on crime—that is, to punish or not punish an offender. Suppose that the offender derives a monetary gain of ==== from committing an offense which would cause social harm of ====. Assume further that enforcement takes the form of a fine of ====> ====, which is imposed with certainty if the enforcer adopts the tough strategy (i.e., apprehends the offender) but is not imposed if the enforcer adopts the soft strategy. Assume that the cost of the tough strategy is ====, where ==== > ====. The strategies and resulting payoffs to the two parties are shown in Table 1.====Note that if the offender does not commit an offense, neither party incurs a cost or benefit.==== Thus, payoffs for both parties in the bottom row are zero. However, if the offender does commit an offense, and the enforcer apprehends and fines the offender, the offender’s payoff is ==== < 0, and the enforcer’s payoff is ==== 0==== Finally, if the offender commits the offense and the enforcer does not impose any punishment, the payoffs are ==== and –====, respectively (i.e., the enforcer incurs no apprehension cost and so no fine is imposed).====Assuming simultaneous moves by the two players, it is easy to verify, given our assumptions, that there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria of this game: {Commit, Soft} and (Not commit, Tough}.==== The ranking of these equilibria in terms of welfare depends on whether ==== is larger or smaller than ====; if ==== <==== the latter equilibrium (no crime) is more efficient, whereas if ==== > ==== the reverse is true. Our focus will be on the former case (inefficient crimes), which is consistent with setting ====> ==== in this example, and also with the common perception that crimes are unwanted acts.==== Nonetheless, there is nothing in the structure of the game to suggest which equilibrium is more likely to arise.====Note that the existence of these two equilibria reflects the paradox identified above regarding the credibility of enforcement and its effect on offender behavior. The “high-crime” outcome is an equilibrium, despite the fact that crime goes unpunished, because it would be costly for the enforcer to switch from “soft” to “tough” once the cost of the crime has been incurred. In other words, once the specific deterrent effect of punishment on this offender has failed, it would be irrational to incur the cost of punishing him.====This paradox becomes even more severe if we introduce an explicit dynamic element to the model, which more realistically captures the fact that crime and punishment unfold over time, with the enforcer only acting to impose (or to refrain from imposing) punishment ==== a crime has been committed. Indeed, if we formulate the above game in that way, with the offender moving first, then there is only one subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium—namely, {Commit, Soft}.====To account for the possibility of general deterrence—i.e., the deterrent effect of punishing this offender on the actions of future offenders—we would have to introduce a sequence of offenders, and, presumably, an infinite time horizon to rule out unraveling. While not denying that such a set-up would prove insightful, we believe that the current version of the model, although highly stylized, identifies a real problem confronting law enforcement in the short run, and may thereby shed light on actual law enforcement policies. It may also account for certain anomalies in crime data, such as the fact that jurisdictions with higher expenditures on criminal punishment do not necessarily have lower crime rates.====The current paper explores this issue by introducing an explicit dynamic element into the standard Becker-Polinsky-Shavell (BPS) model of crime (Becker, 1968, Polinsky and Shavell, 2007). The idea is to examine the incentives to expend resources on enforcement once a crime has been committed. Obviously, to some extent the pre-existence of an enforcement apparatus serves as a form of commitment to investigate crimes as they happen, but unavoidably there remains discretion after the fact based on the availability of resources, different decision makers with varying motives, and changing political attitudes regarding policing, any of which can impede enforcement efforts. The model to be developed here seeks to capture those factors in a simple way, and to study their effect on equilibrium crime rates.====The previous paper that is closest to the current one is by Bar-Gill and Harel (2001), which also pointed out the possibility of multiple equilibria in law enforcement. In their model, this arose from a recognition that the probability of apprehension is not independent of the crime rate, as is usually assumed. Rather, as more crimes are committed, enforcers constrained by a fixed budget will not be able to maintain the same rate of apprehensions. Once this possibility is incorporated into the model, equilibria involving high or low crime rates can arise from a given enforcement policy (i.e., budget and sanction level). The current paper elaborates on this insight in substantially greater detail and draws policy implications.====Mazyaki and van der Weele (2019) also study a model of law enforcement that potentially generates multiple equilibria. Their model, however, studies the dual enforcement mechanisms of the threat of a legal sanction and the impact of reputation, or esteem, which is produced when people are observed complying with the law. As in the current paper, equilibria involving both low and high levels of crime can arise in their model. In a very different context, Fluet (2003) also shows that when third-party (court) enforcement of contracts occurs under conditions of imperfect verifiability, multiple equilibria can exist involving differing qualities of contractual performance. Finally, the issues raised in this paper relate to the experimental literature on voluntary contributions to a public good, which are sometimes enforced by “altruistic” third parties who may be motivated by indignation triggered by free-riding behavior.","Crime, credible enforcement, and multiple equilibria",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000545,16 October 2021,2021,Research Article,57.0

There are three broad policies available to the government in this regard: not prohibiting the act at all, enacting a law and enforcing it, and enacting a law and not enforcing it. When enactment is costly and a fraction of the population reflexively complies with the law once its enactment has been announced (reflecting an expressive function of law), all three policies may be optimal, depending on the severity of the harm from the act and the fraction of reflexive compliers.","There are at least two reasons for not enforcing a law. One is that the law in question, while once useful, has become anachronistic or obsolete, and so enforcing it no longer serves a social purpose. Most jurisdictions retain such laws on the books as relics of the past. The second and more interesting reason is that a law is enacted purely for its symbolic or instructive value but with no intention of expending resources to enforce it. If enactment is costly, such an action can nevertheless serve a social purpose if there are some people who will obey the law reflexively—that is, regardless of the threat of punishment—because they view compliance as the “right” thing to do. Such an impulse may arise as a consequence of people’s moral beliefs or their commitment to civic virtue.====Whatever its source, legal scholars and some economists have discussed this behavior within the context of the “expressive function of law.” For example, the legal philosopher H.L.A. Hart (1982, p. 6) asked, ""Why are certain kinds of actions forbidden by law and so made crimes or offenses? The answer is: To announce to society that these actions are not to be done and to secure that fewer of them are done.""==== Economic models of crime, however, have largely ignored this function of law.==== This paper examines how the expressive function affects both the enactment and enforcement decisions.====The analysis is related to the literature on the optimal scope of criminal law. Among these papers, Shavell (1993), Bowles et al. (2008), and Mungan (2012) question under what circumstances criminal law, as opposed to other kinds of regulation, ought to be used to deter harmful acts. In a similar vein, Garoupa and Klerman (2002) and Mungan and Miceli (2021) consider a rent-seeking law enforcer and legislator, respectively, and explain how these agents can cause an inefficient scope of criminal law to be implemented. Other articles have questioned how the criminalization and enforcement of minor or regulatory offenses can increase the commission of more traditional and serious crimes. Among these, Mungan (2016) formalizes the idea that the criminalization of minor offenses can dilute the stigma attached to more serious crimes.==== Similarly, Kim and Byeon (2017) note that prosecutors may prioritize the enforcement of regulatory offenses due to political pressures, and they provide an empirical analysis of how this prioritization affects the commission of more traditional crimes. Finally, Miceli and Mungan (2021) investigate how enforcement costs as well as the properties of benefits from crime may affect the optimal scope of criminal law.====We add to this growing body of literature by asking a question that has thus far been omitted; namely, whether the optimal scope of regulation may contain laws which are purposefully not enforced. We point out that when some individuals reflexively obey the law, this may in fact be an optimal policy. In the next section, we demonstrate this within the context of a standard law enforcement model, and characterize the optimal policies.==== Section 3 considers an extension that generalizes the model, and Section 4 concludes.",An economic theory of optimal enactment and enforcement of laws,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000533,15 October 2021,2021,Research Article,58.0

Unlike previous literature, we examine all these channels within a single regression framework. Importantly, we develop a new measure of institutional intensity of exports at the goods level based on nearly one hundred million disaggregated bilateral trade flows. Our new measure shows that goods subject to international fragmentation of production are the most institutionally intensive. Using a sample of 144 countries, our regression results show that specialization on institutionally intensive exports, especially on fragmented goods, helps countries to improve their rule of law. In addition, we find that greater openness improves the rule of law, but we fail to find any effect from natural resources exports.","A voluminous body of research has documented that good institutions are key to long-term economic development and that the quality of institutions differs sharply across countries (Acemoglu et al., 2005a, Acemoglu et al., 2005b, North, 1990). A large body of literature has also examined the drivers of these institutional differences and suggested various channels (Acemoglu et al., 2001, Sokoloff and Engerman, 2000), such as legal origin, ethnic heterogeneity, factor endowments, climate, or international trade.====Analyzing the effects of international trade on domestic institutions regularly involves problems of reverse causality, as institutions also affect size and patterns of trade. An important concept for dealing with this reverse causality is ====, i.e., predicting exports exclusively on the basis of geographical gravity variables, to render thus predicted trade flows independent from institutions (Levchenko, 2013). A second central concept in the literature is that of ====, which indicates the degree to which a productive activity does require the existence of a functioning economic institution, such as the rule of law (Levchenko, 2007, Nunn, 2007). Weighting a country's geographically pre-determined exports of goods with the institutional intensities of goods opens the way for determining the ====, a key variable in the quest for establishing the effects from a country's international trade on its institutions.====Three channels have recently been analyzed through which size and patterns in international trade affect institutions. First, in strengthening previous empirical studies, such as those of Rigobon and Rodrik (2005) and Rodrik et al. (2004), Jiao and Wei (2017) find that geographically predetermined overall openness to trade positively affects institutional quality. Second, Do and Levchenko (2007) and Levchenko (2013) show positive effects on a country's rule of law stemming from specializing in exporting institutionally intensive manufacturing goods. Third, a dependence on natural resources may deteriorate institutional quality (e.g., Bhattacharyya and Hodler, 2010). While the first channel concerns the size of a country's trade, the other two relate to patterns of specialization and trade.====This paper analyzes these channels in a unified regression framework on a global dataset, developing novel measures for institutional intensities at the level of individual goods. This approach allows analyzing trade pattern effects on institutional quality for separate goods categories. For that purpose, we differentiate between primary, fragmented, and other goods. Singling out not only primary but also goods subject to international fragmentation of production is motivated by our aim to connect institutions to globalization. Based on the endogenous growth literature, technological change is characterized by a deepening division of labor leading to continuous fragmentation of production processes. As a result, technological change leads to international specialization along the value chain. This specialization, in turn, generates increasing trade not only in final but also in intermediate goods, all of which is very much at the heart of the globalization of production (see, e.g., Yi, 2003). As fragmentation and international specialization along value chains are especially observed in the production of capital goods and transport equipment (Kimura et al., 2007), we summarize capital goods and transport equipment, including their respective parts and components, as fragmented goods.====Regarding the measure of a country's institutional quality, we focus on the rule of law because it subsumes the economically most significant formal institutions governing trade. We indicate the quality of the rule of law by the widely-received respective World Bank indicator, which captures the “perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence” (Kaufmann et al., 2011, p. 4).====The major innovation of this paper relates to institutional intensity measurement. Levchenko (2013) measures contract intensity, i.e., the required degree of enforceability of contractual claims, for each of 28 manufacturing industries provided in Nunn (2007) as “[…] the fraction of each industry's inputs not sold on organized exchanges or reference priced” (Levchenko, 2013, p. 1164). These measures are based on the product classification in Rauch (1999) and one particular U.S. input-output table at one point in time. While we acknowledge the advantages of this method, it suffers from several shortcomings: first, by using an input-output table from one country at one point in time only, it is implicitly assumed that institutional intensities measured in the U.S. are also valid for all other countries at other times. Second, institutional intensity measurement is on the aggregate industry level rather than on the goods level. Third, the trade-based product classification in Rauch (1999) must be converted from an outdated Revision 2 of the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), adopted in 1974, to the 3-digit Revision 2 of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), adopted in 1968. Both have since been superseded by updated revisions, current versions in use for both being Revisions 4, respectively. In general, any conversion of these classifications is problematic, as Muendler (2009) explains in further detail. Fourth, primary production is excluded. Fifth, the measure concentrates on contract enforcement, which is just one aspect of rule of law.====We contribute to this research by substituting industry-specific contract intensity measurement with determining rule of law intensity at the goods level. To do so, we first use nearly one hundred million disaggregated bilateral trade flows between 1995 and 2010 in Frankel and Romer (1999) regressions to obtain estimates of geographically predetermined goods-specific export shares for each country. These shares enable us to calculate the rule of law intensity of a country's total exports. Our novel measure covers all traded goods, including primary goods; does not rely on the technological or institutional circumstances of one specific country at one specific point in time but rather uses information from a global set of countries over fifteen years; and extends beyond contract intensity. Importantly, our measure of the rule of law intensity of a country's total exports is the first in the literature to unambiguously distinguish specialization in institutionally intensive exports from openness ====.====We proceed by demonstrating that our measure of the rule of law intensity of a country's exports—when applied to any of our three goods categories—can be decomposed into two terms: (i) the covariance between goods-specific export shares and rule of law intensities and (ii) the share of the respective goods category (primary, fragmented or other) in a country's total exports. We argue that the covariance terms express the extent of specialization in rule-of-law-intensive exports within each goods category and that they do so perfectly independently from openness ==== and the simple export shares of the three goods categories with respect to total exports.====Armed with our novel measures, we propose a unified empirical cross-section framework that allows for two conclusions. First, we confirm earlier findings in the literature: geographically predetermined openness to trade improves a country's rule of law. Second, we investigate the role of export patterns. We find that the only pattern that matters for a country's rule of law is a country's specialization in rule-of-law-intensive fragmented goods. In consequence, the positive association between a country's predisposition to export rule-of-law-intensive goods and its overall rule of law stems from one well-defined subset of goods only, i.e., the fragmented goods. This result suggests a positive aspect of participating in the globalization of production. As a corollary, our results do not support the existence of an institutional resource curse, i.e., that a dependence on the exports of natural resources undermines the rule of law. Our goal is to emphasize that geographical pre-determination can play a role in analyzing institutional level effects in the cross-section. For that purpose, we are convinced of the exogeneity of our regressors, in particular our measures of institutional intensity based on geographical pre-determination. On the other hand, despite our efforts to minimize omitted variable bias, our cross-section approach, of course, limits claims to causality.====The remainder is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the scarce literature examining trade channels of cross-country differences in institutional quality. In Section 3, we introduce our new measures. Section 4 outlines the estimation strategy. In Section 5, we present our results. Section 6 shows robustness checks, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

We focus on buying transactions to avoid the cases where investors are forced to close their positions. Our results first show that insider transactions are associated with significant and positive excess returns above the SSE 180 and SZSE 100 market indexes. We also simulate random investors and compare their performance with the insiders and find that random investors outperform insiders. On average, insiders do not seem to have specific market timing skills in their purchase decisions, since they are not able to beat pure random investors. We further investigate the main drivers of the performance of insiders. Our results show that (1) the market return, the Sharpe ratio, unsystematic risk and GDP are the most influential factors, (2) the explanatory of the variables’ set is larger for SZSE than for SSE, and (3) the drivers’ estimates decrease as the holding period increases.","Insider trading has long been a source of controversy in financial market research. In Manne (1966)'s seminal book, the author argues that insiders should be allowed to trade and benefit from their participation. Their activities would improve the company's decision making process as well as its overall value in the market. However, a set of insider trading laws have been implemented in many different countries, thereby challenging the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) popularized by Fama (1970). The main objective of such reforms is to increase fairness in the market by sharing the profits made by insiders with outsiders. Yet, this comes at the cost of market efficiency. If the strong form of the EMH holds, then, all publicly and privately available information is already encompassed in the stocks’ prices. There is no incentive for insiders to try to outperform the buy-and-hold benchmark by improving their market timing. As such, as outlined by De La Brunière et al. (2020), on which we partly ground, tracking insider transactions is irrelevant and useless. Yet, as demonstrated by Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), if insiders lose incentive to process private inside information then, EMH's strong form may never be achieved, as the lack of private information processing does not allow its incorporation in the current stock price. Leland (1992) argues in favor of that point. As such, insider trading laws may be seen as a way to reduce insider returns but also as an impediment to the efficient formation of prices. On the contrary, a lack of insider trading regulation can generate perverse behavior for insiders as they may decide to engage in risky positions inside the business or to stop disclosing some relevant information.====There is however a need to disentangle between legal and illegal insider trading. Fortunately, in most jurisdictions, corporate legal insider trading is not banned: there is only a reporting requirement to the market authorities (the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S., for instance). On the contrary, illegal insider trading is severely punished and totally forbidden. As indicated by Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002), among the 107 countries in which a financial market is actually operating, 87 have addressed the issue by introducing insider trading laws. Since the attempts to engage in illegal insider trading are hidden from the public, the research community cannot analyze the returns made by this category of insiders, if the country's authorities fail to identify such illegal transactions. It is even more the case for China given the only recent advent of market supervision regarding insider trading. China has first addressed illegal insider trading by prohibiting it in the Company Law of 1994, the Criminal Law of 1997 and the Securities Law of 1998. With the subsequent creation of the Chinese Securities Law in 2006 and the implementation of stricter regulation, we can expect that the incentive to engage in illegal insider trading in China is lower, given the associated penalties.====In this paper, we focus on corporate legal insider trading. By corporate legal insider trading, we mean trades that are reported as conducted by insiders. These trades are perfectly legal since the insiders engaging in these activities respect the implemented regulation that requires them to report their trades when they are executed. When they are identified, illegal insider transactions are spotted with a significant delay. As such, it is impossible for outsiders to replicate their trades to benefit from this information, which is why we exclusively investigate legal insider trading in this paper. Furthermore, research on illegal insider transactions can only analyze the cases that have been identified, leaving the undiscovered cases out of the investigation.====This research study specifically focuses on the Chinese Stock Market on its two main venues, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). The motivations to investigate this market are manifold. First of all, according to the World Federation of Exchanges, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) is the fourth largest stock market by market capitalization, estimated at a four trillion U.S. dollars in 2018 and the world's second largest economy as outlined in Huang (2021). Second, as highlighted by Shen (2009), despite the fact that stock markets in China are quite young, with a creation in the beginning of the 1990s, they have been able to profit from the learning journey conducted in other markets, notably the U.S. The Chinese regulator indeed mimicked several regulatory elements that are found in other jurisdictions. For instance, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has been introduced in 1999 as an almost exact copy of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Third, this market introduces a major difference as compared to others since most of the companies were state-owned, and as such, some shares could not be traded. Even if this fact is less true today with the privatization of many firms and the implementation of the split-share reform in 2005, which enhances the ability to trade stocks for private investors by converting non-tradable shares into tradable ones, the consequences of this recent past may still be very influential. As outlined by Shen (2009), around two thirds of the total stock certificates were either state shares or legal person share prior to 2005. As opposed to public shares, these securities are only rarely traded in financial markets. Since a set of shares cannot be traded, the smooth price discovery and price formation mechanisms may not be guaranteed, leading to more frequent and more important market inefficiencies. With the implementation of the split-share reform, this number drops significantly. Yet the legacy of the split share structure may still have an impact on the market. Fourth, the Chinese market is not an entirely open market for foreign investors and as such, most of its trading is domestic, as opposed to most of the countries that were studied from an insider trading perspective. Finally, as outlined by Huang (2021), China is still an emerging market, making it more prone to market misconduct such as insider trading than more developed jurisdictions. Yet, despite all these motivations, the performance of insiders, whose profits are supposed to skyrocket in inefficient markets, has never been thoroughly examined in the Chinese stock market. This paper precisely fills that gap.====This paper contributes to a very broad literature on insider's trading performance. As it is often believed that insiders have more information and the obligation to report insider transactions, many investors try to mimic insiders’ actions in order to get a higher return. Manne (1966) raises a debate by indicating that, if the insiders were allowed to conduct transactions and benefit from their activities, it would alleviate the agency problems faced by managers and shareholders. This would improve the company's decision-making process, thereby increasing the company's overall value (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). The first research studies on insider trading performance focused on the U.S. market and confirmed that abnormal excess returns are a reality (Lorie and Niederhoffer, 1968, Jaffe, 1974, Finnerty, 1976). Other studies reach the same conclusions on different markets (Aktas et al., 2008, Dissanaike and Lim, 2015, Zhu and Wang, 2015, Ojah et al., 2020, Del Brio et al., 2002, John and Narayanan, 1997, Contreras, 2020, Gurgul and Majdosz, 2007, Chauhan et al., 2016). On the contrary, some research studies show that the insiders’ outperformance vanishes as the market becomes more efficient and the regulation tougher (Rozeff and Zaman, 1988, Qiu et al., 2018, Pham, 2020).====Partly grounding on De La Brunière et al. (2020)'s methodology to analyze the performance of insiders, our analysis is conducted on the companies listed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange 180 index (SSE 180) and in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange 100 index (SZSE 100). We first investigate whether insider traders in the Chinese stock market have better market timing skills than random investors. Our dataset covers the period ranging from 2014 to 2019 in order to rule out the effects of time and regulatory changes that occurred prior to 2014 in China. The simulation results are mixed. As opposed to De La Brunière et al. (2020) who find very extreme results, i.e., all the simulated random investors beat the insiders or the opposite, we find that insider's performance is often similar to the one of random investors. As such, they do not seem to have significant market timing skills, as opposed to what may be observed on the French stock market. Yet, these conclusions need to be taken with caution since we analyze a much larger sample of stocks and a different time period. When we compare the whole distributions of returns, random investors significantly outperform insiders. This effect is more valid for periods exceeding one month.====An additional contribution of the present study is the investigation of the main drivers of insiders’ returns. The existing literature highlights that firm-specific factors are the main influential variables (Cohen et al., 1976, Lakonishok and Shapiro, 1986, Vuolteenaho, 2002, Dutt and Humphery-Jenner, 2013), and more particularly the book-to-market ratio and liquidity proxies (Daniel et al., 2001, Artmann et al., 2012, Menike et al., 2015, Aveh and Awunyo-Vitor, 2017, Haugen and Baker, 1996, Baele et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2010, Tandon and Malhotra, 2013, Chen and McMillan, 2020). Some influential macroeconomics determinants are also identified in some markets: inflation rate, GDP (Menike et al., 2015) and unemployment rate (Niewińska, 2019). In order to analyze the determinants of insider returns, we conduct a least angle regression algorithm (LAR), that grounds on the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) selection method, on a large set of potential candidates. Our results indicate that the returns obtained by insiders are associated with different determinants, depending on the venue where the firm trades. For SSE 180, the market return and the unsystematic risk are the most influential factors. For SZSE 100, it appears that the set of candidate variables explains more variations than in the SSE 180 case. Unsystematic risk, Sharpe ratio, market return and GDP are the most influential factors. Globally, we observe that the magnitude of the parameter estimates drops when the holding period increases, pointing to a larger short term effect of some of the variables, while the general explanatory power of the models increases. All in all, we conclude that our set of variables succeeds in determining part of the insiders’ return, while we conjecture that the other part might be associated to insider-specific variables that are difficult to obtain.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a presentation of the background of the study. Section 3 presents the database and some descriptive statistics. Section 4 presents and discusses our empirical findings.==== The final section concludes.",Corporate legal insider trading in China: Performance and determinants,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014481882100048X,23 September 2021,2021,Research Article,60.0

Our results are obtained with the standard model of hospital competition where a distinction can now be made between two different dimensions of quality while using fair general demand and cost structure. In our setting, hospitals can choose to invest either in the quality of health care services which reduces exposition to the risk of medical error, or in another dimension of quality which is independent to the risk of medical malpractice (appropriateness, patient-centeredness, amenities, etc.). We derive the conditions under which an intensified competition can not only raise or decrease hospital quality, but can also lead to a substitution between the two dimensions of quality. We also investigate how hospital competition and ==== may interact to help improve quality of care by deterring negligent behaviors of providers of care. Lastly, we use a model of strategic pretrial negotiation under asymmetric information to examine the effect of hospital competition on the resolution of medical disputes through its effect on quality.","The effect of hospital competition on quality has received extensive attention (Colla et al., 2016, Gaynor and Town, 2011, Gaynor et al., 2015). The rationale for policy makers of promoting competition is that under fixed price, competition may lead hospitals to attract additional patients by raising quality levels. This is based on the assumption that intensifying competition increases the effect of quality on demand. Theoretical models have identified several necessary conditions for competition to lead to more quality and have determined the effects of introducing hospital specialization, providers intrinsic motivation and altruism, and sluggish demand (Brekke et al., 2011, Brekke et al., 2012a, Brekke et al., 2012b). For instance, they find that the incentive to attract new patients through an increase of quality, is highest for hospitals operating under high price cost margin (i.e. high marginal benefit of an additional patient). Conversely, in countries where hospitals may operate under negative profit margins (for example Norway), an increase in competition could risk leading to a deterioration of quality. In fact, all these theoretical developments show either a positive or a negative association between competition and quality. The empirical evidence is also mixed on this association with some evidence of zero association. For more details and thorough review of the literature of the effects of hospital competition on quality, see Bloom et al. (2015), Brekke et al. (2018), Cooper et al. (2011), Kessler and McClellan (2000) and Kessler and Geppert (2005).====When modelling the association between competition and hospital quality, quality is always considered as a uni-dimensional notion. These models do not account for a multiplicity of dimensions of quality, for instance: safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timely care, efficiency, and equitability, according to the Institute of Medicine's classification (2001). By addressing quality as a uni-dimensional notion, these models do not allow for competition to affect differently the plural dimensions of hospital quality. Yet, it can easily be conceived that, under certain circumstances, hospital competition could lead to opposing effects on different dimensions of quality. For instance, competition could lead to an increase in interventions with high safety and performance indicators (such as low length of stay, low readmission and mortality rates, low medication errors’) but poor timely care (appropriateness) and patient-centeredness. To our knowledge, remarkably little is developed to address this issue in the theoretical literature of the effects of hospital competition on quality. In contrast, there does exist some other theoretical contributions that consider more than one hospital quality type, but outside the standard hospital competition framework (see Eggleston, 2005, Kaarboe and Siciliani, 2011, Mak, 2018, Sherry, 2016).====The aim of this paper is to build on the standard model of hospital competition with regulated prices by introducing two different dimensions of hospital quality. In contrast to Donabedian's classification of quality indicators into structure, process, and outcomes (1988), we distinguish two dimensions of quality. The first quality measure refers to indicators which reduces the risks of medical error, and the second quality measure concerns all the dimension unrelated to medical error. This classification Going back to the Institute of Medicine's classification, our second measure of quality includes appropriateness, patient-centeredness, as well as amenities (decor, entertainment features, quality of food or room service). For example, cataract interventions are characterized by very rare complications and short length of stay, (i.e. high performance and safety indicators, and low risk of medical malpractice). Yet, when these interventions are carried out on patients with high initial visual functioning, medical service rendered can be low or null indicating poor appropriateness. This example illustrates the limits of models with uni-dimensional measures of quality under competition when focusing on medical malpractice behaviors.====In explaining the determinants of the hospital quality choice, competition may not be the sole determinant of quality whatever its nature. One usually considers that the medical malpractice system can help improve quality of health care by deterring negligent behaviors of providers of care. We have a strong conviction that hospital competition and the judicial malpractice system may interact to help improve hospital quality. Studdert et al. (2011) give some evidence of a close relationship between quality of health care and negligence lawsuit risk. This is because tort law provides some rules by which one patient can litigate to recover damages for personal injury from the provider of care (Bertoli and Grembi, 2018). In details, the patient makes a claim with the court that the hospital has harmed them. Next, the lawsuit specifies the hospital's acts and the damage those acts imposed on the patient. It also specifies the amount of financial damages to compensate victims beared by the negligent hospital. Such a negligence occurs when the hospital causes harm to a patient that could reasonably have been prevented. Consequently, in order to obtain a financial compensation from hospitals, patients must prove that they were harmed, and that the actions of the hospital was responsible for the harm. In other terms, they must show that the hospital's behavior did not meet the standard quality of health care as the law recognizes that many of medical adverse events may occur irregardless of hospitals actions. This process consumes large amounts of resources. For example, the hospital and the patient may hire experts to testify about the case, issues of negligence, medical causality and the extent of the damages incurred by the patient. Here, the risk is that some patients will prefer to drop the case, even if this action in turn cancels any incentives to improve the quality of care. Furthermore, some medical malpractice cases will be settled in advance of a trial, quite often with a lower financial reward from the hospital to the patient.====Despite the resources devoted to the legal system, the court system is imperfect (Farber and White, 1991). We give an example. Assume that a patient suffers an adverse event, but not through negligent behavior of the hospital. The patient may sue the hospital only because of the injury itself. Then, an imperfect court system could allow a financial compensation to this patient even though negligence did not occur. This situation may arise when patients are opportunistic or, more certainly, when they are unable to distinguish whether or not their injuries are caused by negligence. Conversely, an imperfect court system could also hinder financial compensations to patients while hospital negligence really occurred. So, even when the hospital undertakes enough activity to prevent harm, it may loose its litigation because of an imperfect court system. However, we keep in mind that if a medical accident occurs, the hospital is less likely to be found liable if its chosen quality level is high enough. As a consequence, the expected amount of damages incurred when harm takes place, and transferred from the hospital to the patient, should decrease with the level of hospital quality of care. To complete this analysis, we also study a situation with perfectly functioning courts. If courts do not make any errors then they will award damages only to patients negligently injured. It follows that hospitals will take all actions to prevent harm under the condition that it would on average cost less to prevent that harm than the costs of the harm itself. In this context, we identify the necessary conditions for hospital competition to lead to more quality, and the influence of the legal norm or quality standard on each hospital's quality choice.====Finally, we take a closer look at the effect of hospital competition on the interaction between the hospital and the patient once a medical accident has occurred. Indeed, we have some evidence of medical malpractice cases settled in advance of a trial while other cases go in trial (Danzon and Lillard, 1982, Danzon, 1985b, White, 1994). Further, we expect that legal expenses differ according to each issue (out-of-court settlements are much less costly and time consuming), as well as the amount of payment from the hospital to the patient (Avraham, 2007). So we use a model of strategic pretrial negotiation under asymmetric information ==== Bebchuk (1984) to examine how the degree of hospital competition may have an influence on (i) the probability that the case is defended at trial or settled, and (ii) the amount of the out-of-court financial compensation paid by the hospital to the patient in order to compensate the harm. These results bring new insight about the consequences of the association between competition and quality on the medical disputes.====By introducing a distinction between quality indicators according to whether or not they affect the risk of medical malpractice, our model enables for the first time to explore new properties of quality in a competitive market with fixed prices. Notably, (1) the effect an increase a dimension of quality such as patient-centerdness or amenities may have on the risk of medical malpractice. Or, (2) how the judiciary treatment of malpractice cases may impact quality investment.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we remind the basic framework of hospital competition in a market with regulated prices. In Section 3, we present a more general model where two types of quality are introduced. In Section 4 we investigate the effect of competition on hospitals’ quality choices under the assumption that courts are imperfect, meaning that they could award damages to patients whether or not the hospital is really negligent. Section 5 provides an analysis of the effect of competition on quality under the assumption that the court system is perfect (awarding damages only to patients negligently injured). In Section 6, we examine how the intensity of hospital competition may impact the resolution of medical disputes.

We combine the Mallows model averaging (MMA) method with both the dummy variable (DV) and forecasting approaches to investigate the famous citric acid cartel case during the 1990s. The path of but-for prices generated from the MMA method with DV specification lies in-between those generated from the forecasting and DV methods, supporting the theoretical properties of the MMA method that weights over different forecasts generated from various candidate models. The findings indicate that the but-for prices generated from the MMA method could serve as a useful robustness check for cartel damage estimations.","It is widely known that infringement from a cartel might greatly damage the relevant market involved, because it decreases consumer surplus and causes deadweight loss by affecting the interactions between demand and supply. Among all the possible damages a cartel might generate, a price-fixing overcharge is a direct wealth loss for buyers resulting from a collusive agreement among cartel members. Indirect buyers farther down the distribution channel of the cartel are also hurt. This explains why antitrust enforcers of many countries spend tremendous efforts to prosecute these illegal domestic and international cartels, and the annual sum of civil fines for cartel participants easily exceeds millions or billions of dollars in any given country.====When market participants are risk-neutral, the decision to practice collusion is directly influenced by the level of potential fines (Besanko and Spulber, 1989, Souam, 2001).==== In order to discourage the incentives of practicing cartels, antitrust authorities regularly employ economic penalties against antitrust violation. This also corresponds to the previous observation that the annual sum of civil fines enacted upon a cartel could be enormous. However, quantification of the size of fines is not arbitrary, as antitrust enforcers need to measure the magnitude of cartel overcharges that are used as a base for any sanction.====This research focuses on the performances of various reduced-form price equations to predict but-for prices (the price level when the cartel does not form), which are inevitable for estimating a cartel overcharge. Indeed, price equations are the most common statistical methods used in antitrust litigation as documented by Baker and Rubinfeld (1999, p. 391). One particular merit for applying the price equation approach to estimate the magnitude of cartel overcharge is that information from other markets is not needed. In fact, many cartel studies based on price equations adopt “before and after” approaches that compare prices during the alleged cartel period with prices before a cartel agreement was reached or after a cartel's breakdown. See Connor, 2001, Connor, 2004, Clarke and Evenett (2003), Harrington, 2004a, Harrington, 2004b about the applications of before and after methods in antitrust studies.====There are two approaches commonly used for the before and after paradigm: the “dummy variable (DV) approach” and the “out-of-sample forecasting approach”. The first difference between these two methods is that the DV approach uses the whole time series for estimation, while the forecasting one uses only the data outside of the alleged cartel period. The second difference is more obvious - that is, one additional dummy variable for characterizing the period of the cartel is included in the DV model specification during the estimation stage, but it is not used for the forecasting approach.====There is a common feature shared by the DV and forecasting approaches, which can be categorized as price prediction regressions; i.e., they both need to forecast a “but-for” price during the legally established infringement periods in order to quantify the overcharges by comparing the difference between the but-for price and the cartel one. Operationally, the estimated parameter of the cartel dummy in the DV approach is not used for price prediction under the DV approach scenario. The cartel dummy is utilized to control the effects of cartels on the estimation of the other important coefficients in the price equation when we use the whole sample series. In fact, both price prediction methods employ the same set of parameters, except that they are estimated with different model specifications and data periods. See Salkever (1976), Fisher (1980), Rubinfeld, 1985, Rubinfeld, 2000, and Nieberding (2006) for discussions concerning the relative advantages of these two approaches. Moreover, given that the but-for prices are usually predicted via the use of dynamic models, we see many recent cartel studies adopt lagged prices as additional explanatory variables, including White et al. (2006), McCrary and Rubinfeld (2014), Boswijk et al. (2019).====In order to give a more concrete comparison between these approaches under the dynamic model scenario, we take the famous citric acid cartel case as an example. In the following empirical studies shown in Table 1 of the paper, the forecasting method uses the first 17 observations of the data from Connor (1998, with 87 observations in total) to estimate the coefficients of an autoregressive model of lag 1, or AR(1) model, while the corresponding DV approach uses a total of 87 observations to estimate the parameters of the AR(1) model plus an additional coefficient of DV. Since there is the presence of lag 1 price, the number of observations used for the AR(1) forecasting model is 16, while the corresponding AR(1) DV approach is 86 as clearly shown in Table 1 of the paper. However, both methods apply these same set of AR(1) parameters (constant plus the coefficient of lag 1 price) to generate but-for prices starting from the 18th observation onward. The coefficient of DV within the DV model is not used for generating but-for prices. It is only a control variable to ensure that the estimates of the other coefficients in the DV model are consistent.====This paper points out an important issue not properly considered when estimating cartel damages based on the dynamic price model - that is, previous studies do not systematically address the fact that we do not know how many demand and supply shifters and lagged prices should be included in the price regression. Therefore, we are unable to realize the extent to which the choice of the control variables and lagged prices could affect the accuracy of the predicted but-for prices and how serious this could affect the subsequent estimation of overcharges. Since the issue of model uncertainty is so important to cartel litigation, we should sincerely deal with the robustness check emphasized in Friederiszick and Röller (2010) in court proceedings. Indeed, model uncertainty has been addressed in the field of law. Cohen-Cole et al. (2009) particularly deal with the potential deterrent effect of capital punishment with model averaging methods where they treat the “true” model of a phenomenon as being unknown. Theoretically, the first step of the model averaging procedure is the formulation of a space of candidate models. The second step is to estimate each model in the model space. Third, these estimated models are then averaged with the averaging weights representing the probabilities that each of the models is the true one. One may employ the Bayesian approach of Raftery (1995) to evaluate these weights.====In this paper we present an easy-to-implement ordinary least squared (OLS) based forecast combination procedure based on the Mallows model averaging (MMA) criterion for the cartel literature, because Hansen (2008) demonstrates that the MMA estimator outperforms the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Hannan-Quinn (HQ) principle, and other averaging methods in terms of forecasting performance. Wong and Tsay (2021) consider the asymptotic properties of the MMA estimator under a mixed-frequency setting, while Liao and Tsay (2020) extend the coverage of the MMA estimators to the vector autoregressive (VAR) model.==== One of the distinguishing features of this paper is to combine the MMA method with both the DV and forecasting approaches, respectively, to investigate the famous citric acid cartel case during the 1990s. The path of but-for prices generated from the MMA method with DV specification lies in-between those generated from the forecasting and DV methods. This phenomenon is reasonable, because the MMA approach weights over different forecasts generated from various candidate models. This also indicates that the but-for prices generated from the MMA method could serve as a useful robustness check for cartel damage estimations.====The rest of the paper runs as follows. Section 2 introduces the dynamic price equation and the class of before and after approaches and also illustrates the MMA estimator. Section 3 presents the detailed studies of the citric acid cartel.

This study uses data on property-liability insurance policies from a German insurer encompassing the years just before and just after the Directive, to provide evidence of the impact of licensing on insurance intermediation quality. Because many agents left the market once licensing was required, we compare the pre-Directive quality of agents who exit the market with those who remain, and the pre- versus post-Directive quality of agents who remain in the market. Estimation results show no significant effects of licensing on agent quality, either through exit of low-quality agents or through changes in post-Directive quality. Results are most consistent with an increase in consumer search activity after the enactment of licensing.","Entry restrictions and minimum qualification requirements in professional service occupations have a long history in the market economies of the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), and apply to a wide range of professions from health and financial services, to teaching, real estate, beauty and food services.==== In public policy debates, occupational licensing is often justified as necessary to improve or maintain high quality of service provision within the licensed profession. The economic frame for this argument relies on information asymmetries that make it difficult for consumers to determine professional service quality. Yet the prevailing view of professional licensing in the economics literature runs counter to this argument. Most empirical studies conclude that the main beneficiaries of licensing are the regulated professions: licensing raises barriers to entry, and consequently raises wages and prices. Most studies find little or no positive effects of licensing on quality of services received by consumers.==== However, the difficulty of measuring quality is a noted weakness in the literature, and quality is often measured as input quality rather than as output or outcome quality. Thus, the evidence on the quality effects of licensing is far from definitive.====This study provides new evidence on the quality effects of licensing for insurance agents. Insurance is sold using a variety of distribution channels, only some of which are mediated by professional agents. When utilized, agents play an important role in insurance purchase transactions, and are generally the only contact a customer has with the insurance company. Agents offer information and advice on insurance options, risks, and risk management, potentially improving the matching of consumers with insurance products (Eckardt, 2007). Because insurance quality is difficult for consumers to observe, in many cases even after purchase, the quality of agent services is an important public policy concern, and professional insurance agents (those that provide advice or matching services) face licensing requirements in many countries (Tennyson, 2011a). Although the quality of insurance intermediation services has been widely studied====, to our knowledge ours is the first study of the effects of licensing on insurance intermediation quality.====The context for our study is the German insurance market after the 2007 implementation of the EU Directive on Insurance Mediation (IMD, or Directive).==== The IMD imposed minimum standards of professionalism and competence for insurance agents and brokers throughout the EU. The law regulates both agent entry into the market and the conduct of intermediation, through minimum entry standards and ongoing behavioral standards. Behavioral standards include requirements to provide information about their license, their relationships with insurance companies, and consumers’ rights under insurance contracts. The customer's desires and needs must be taken into consideration when providing advice, specific product information must be reviewed, and recommendations must be based on a sufficient number of insurance products. Entry standards include mandatory registration in the professional trade Register and the meeting of four qualification requirements: (1) passing a test organized by the German chamber of industry and commerce, (2) hold professional liability insurance, (3) having a clean criminal record, and (4) a solid financial condition.====The IMD created the first licensing requirements for insurance agents in Germany. Before its implementation, there had been no legal standards or professional regulation of the practice of insurance agents in Germany. The potential for licensing to increase transparency and quality in the German agent market certainly exists, as substantial deficiencies in intermediation practices in the pre-licensing regime had been documented.==== However, licensing was not adopted to address any specific problems in the German market, but to comply with the EU Directive. Thus, introduction of agent licensing in Germany constitutes a unique quasi-experiment that produces an exogenous increase in formal barriers to entry and higher minimum quality standards for the profession.====We study the quality effects of agent licensing using data on insurance agents' portfolios of contracts that we obtained from a German insurance company. Our panel dataset is comprised of individual property-liability insurance policies in force each year for the period 2004–2010. Reported variables include the duration of the policy, characteristics of the agent who sold and serviced the policy, and customer characteristics. The structure of the dataset facilitates comparison of pre-licensing (2004–2006) and post-licensing (2008–2010) outcomes for agents employed through the full study period, and comparison in the pre-licensing period of agents who exited after licensing was required to those who did not. Our empirical analysis tests for two effects predicted by quality assurance theories of occupational licensing: that licensing will lead lower-quality agents to exit the market, and that quality provided by agents who remain in the market will increase after licensing.====This research is important in the context of the EU’s more recent Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) of 2016====, which broadens and strengthens professional requirements for insurance agents. If the initial licensing regulations in the IMD did not lead to higher quality insurance agents, there remains a potential for additional professional requirements to assure high quality intermediation services. Some observers have argued that the initial IMD entry requirements were not stringent enough, and research on the implications of the behavioral requirements of the law conclude that these requirements were also not especially binding (Heinrich et al., 2008; Schwarzbach et al., 2011). On the other hand, if licensing substantially decreases the number of agents or raises the costs of agent advice, this raises the possibility of an “advice gap” – in which consumers who receive advice get better advice, but not all consumers have access to advice (Ring, 2016).====Our estimation results suggest that the IMD licensing requirements led less productive agents to exit the market, but there is no evidence that these agents provided lower service quality. There is also no evidence of service quality improvements after the introduction of licensing. An apparent impact of licensing was an increase in consumer search behavior, since we observe a large and statistically significant increase in the rate of customer-initiated contract cancellations after licensing in both the agent-serviced and direct-sales distribution channels. Because there are no apparent quality effects of licensing, and because licensing greatly reduced the number of intermediaries in the market, the gains from these search activities are uncertain, but could increase consumer welfare if insurance consumers search or switch contracts at less than optimal rates in normal market circumstances (Schlesinger and von der Schulenburg, 1993; Israel, 2005; Honka, 2014).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the literature on entry restrictions into professional service occupations. Section 3 outlines the study’s research design, and Section 4 describes the data. Analysis of pre-licensing quality of agents who exited versus those who remained after licensing is reported in Section 5. Pre-licensing versus post-licensing quality for agents who remained in the market is analyzed in Section 6.

We follow Jensen and Meckling’s (1976) and Myers’ (1977) intuitions that leverage may result in excess value appropriation by creditors while at the same time acting to discipline ==== appropriation. Creditors’ holdup refers to the appropriation by the incumbent debtholders of a large part of the additional value created by an incentivized controlling shareholder. This paper introduces a negotiation framework between controlling and outside shareholders in which releveraging and private benefits are decided while the process of value creation initiates a transfer of value to the creditors. The admissible contracts of control involve a minimum jump in leverage. This result gives a theoretical foundation for the leveraged recap decisions observed in the market and one-off variations of the capital structure.","Leveraged recapitalizations are observed and well-identified corporate decisions. Typically, a firm decides to releverage its capital structure in a one-off change, and the debt proceeds are distributed to the current shareholders through exceptional dividends or share buybacks. In 2013, KKR received an exceptional dividend from the British retailer Pets at Home, which it bought two years earlier for £955 million, by adding £135 million in new debt. As a consequence of this operation, the ratio of total debt to EBITDA reached the high level of 5.==== Shivdasani and Zak (2007) analyze public firms’ leveraged recap decisions in the 2003–2007 period. Because of the releveraging decision, the S&P credit rating score dropped one “notch”, while the firm’s stock exhibited an average abnormal return of 6.8 %.====Releveraging is frequently analyzed as a univocal transfer of value funded by creditors that is unfavorable to them. However, in the context of value-enhancing events, releveraging should not be highlighted without first identifying a creditors’ holdup mechanism. Here, holdup describes the appropriation by the incumbent debtholders of a large part of the additional value created by an incentivized controlling shareholder. This is particularly true when one-off events such as unexpected acquisition announcements occur and disclose possible gains. This paper introduces a negotiation framework between controlling and outside shareholders in which releveraging and incentivization through private benefits are jointly decided. In the context of value-enhancing events, we show the existence of a nonempty space of contracts of control between the controlling and outside shareholders.====A pure capital structure model focusing only on the conflict between creditors and shareholders considered as a whole would ignore that debt is also the source of a disagreement between the controlling and outside shareholders. This paper introduces private benefits and agency conflict among shareholders to explain jumps in leverage. Our framework considers that the releveraging decision develops in connection with the process of creating economic value in the firm and is not a simple discretionary decision by an incentivized manager. Therefore, we do not build on frameworks that are pegged on exogeneous commitments (DeMarzo and He, 2016; Dangl et Zechner, 2016). This study belongs to the literature that analyzes agency conflicts between managers and outside investors as a key determinant of capital structure. Among others, DeMarzo and Sannikov (2006) and DeMarzo and Fishman (2007) investigate the effects of agency conflicts on capital structure with risk-neutral agents and complete contracting. In their seminal paper, Jensen and Meckling (1976) focus on the one-way wealth transfer from bondholders to shareholders. In a footnote, they explain that they do not consider the opposite symmetric case, in which “==== (footnote 49, page 339). In our framework, bondholders benefit from the controlling shareholder’s effort to create value, and we follow Jensen and Meckling’s (1976) intuition of a two-way transfer of wealth between shareholders and debtholders.====In this paper, we consider that the conflict between shareholders involves two key mechanisms: incentivization and releveraging. Myers (1977) show that shareholders will not finance a valuable investment if such an investment will result in a large increase in the value of existing debt. This “debt overhang” problem has been revisited and extended to “effort” as opposed to “underinvestment” problems (He, 2011): the increase in the value of existing debt acts as a tax and thus reduces incentives for shareholders to make an effort. We explicitly introduce the releveraging decision. In our framework, the issuance of new debt leads to a transfer of value from creditors to shareholders that partly offsets this creditors’ holdup. In that sense, our paper is also in the spirit of the leverage ratchet effect of Admati et al. (2018), who show that shareholders always gain from a one-time debt issuance in case the debt capacity is not exhausted. In the context of value-enhancing events, controlling shareholders and outside shareholders agree on the principle of releveraging since they share the objective of limiting the creditors’ holdup. However, they disagree about the optimal ex post debt level; a higher debt will reduce the after-interest cash flows from which the controlling shareholder may capture private benefits. In our framework, these two categories of shareholders bargain upon releveraging together with the incentive contract. We show that a space of negotiation between both categories of shareholders could result in joint feasible releveraging and incentivizing choices.====Our main result is that the determination of private benefits interferes with the current capital structure of the firm. The paper considers the two rationales ensuing from the shareholder-creditor conflict and the controlling-outside shareholder conflict in a single framework.==== This makes the regulation story more complex, as the game involves three parties rather than two. Indebtedness curbs controlling shareholders’ private appropriation, and at the same time, the private benefit incentive initiates a holdup for creditors. This creditors’ holdup is an opportunity cost for any shareholder, but we show that it is asymmetrically shared between outside and controlling shareholders. The releveraging decision and private benefits choices both depend on determinants identified in the capital structure literature (for instance, Myers, 1977; Myers and Majluf, 1984; Harris and Raviv, 1988; Leland, 1994). We identify a specific effect based on a three-party interaction, as we explicitly introduce a difference between controlling and outside shareholders.====This paper refers to two agency issues. The first is the existence of private benefits as an implicit compensation scheme for the controlling shareholder, and the second is the choice of a debt structure with senior standard debt and equity. These two issues are linked since they are based on the change in the economic process of value creation and are addressed within a financial governance framework. We do not question the theoretical issue of the optimal design of the incentive contract (Dewatripont and Tirole, 1994; Lambrecht and Myers, 2008). We do not follow the “EBIT pie” approach, which states that the value of the firm is continuously shared between financial claimants and nonfinancial claimants (i.e., government) and that the capital structure choice is explained by friction costs such as taxes, bankruptcy costs, and restructuring costs (Fisher et al., 1989; Goldstein et al., 2001). Following the M-M avenue, the latter assumes that the firm’s cash flows are invariant to debt choices. Our framework of an event creating a perpetual cash flow increase due to incentivization and a joint change in leverage refers to Jensen and Meckling’s (1976) agency approach to the capital structure choice.====We analyze the process of bargaining between controlling and outside shareholders when both the incentive scheme and the level of releveraging are addressed in the same negotiation. We explicitly identify the creditors’ holdup problem, which should be integrated into a three-party equilibrium scheme based on incentivization, and we provide an additional explanation for jumps in leverage.====Our study contributes to the literature on the relationship between private benefits and the dynamics of capital structure in several ways. First, we develop a model using the option valuation framework. This justifies referring to a risk-neutral hypothesis, as in Leland (1994), 1998; DeMarzo and Fishman (2007); Morellec et al. (2012); Admati et al. (2018), or Morellec et al. (2018). Second, we emphasize the role of debt leverage in agency conflicts because controlling shareholders often find it easier to modify the leverage ratio than to modify their share of capital. This provides a theoretical foundation for the releveraging decisions observed in the market. Outside shareholders will implicitly accept a trade-off because of the incentive characteristics of private benefits and prospect of additional value creation. Our model is set in continuous time but introduces leverage adjustments in a static two-period timeline. Therefore, it focuses on leverage jumps, which is the key outcome variable. It differs from He (2011)’s dynamic continuous revision of the compensation scheme and the literature on dynamic capital structure trade-offs (Goldstein et al., 2001; Dangl and Zechner, 2016; Admati et al., 2018).====We also add to the literature by explicitly introducing the creditors’ holdup in the setting of the contract of control. Aside from the standard Merton case, which uses the simple framework of zero-coupon debt with a fixed nominal value and maturity, we follow Leland (1994); He (2011); Barsotti et al. (2012); Morellec et al. (2012); Attaoui and Poncet (2013), and Morellec et al. (2018), with bankruptcy risk defined with regard to the continuous coupon payment of a perpetual debt. We contribute to the literature analyzing both private benefits and debt leverage changes. It is limited with the exception of He (2011) and Morellec et al. (2018), who aim to jointly analyze the two types of conflicts of interest among shareholders and creditors. Contrary to those articles, we consider private benefit appropriation by controlling shareholders as endogenous.====Our analysis provides an additional governance explanation for the ratchet effect in capital structure that relies on the creditors’ holdup mechanism. Our framework justifies a bias toward releveraging, as in Goldstein et al. (2001) or Admati et al. (2018), and differs from the contributions of recent dynamic capital structure literature leading to deleveraging (DeMarzo and He, 2016; Dangl and Zechner, 2016). Contrary to He (2011), we show that ==== is a way to avoid the creditors’ holdup problem and give a theoretical explanation for one-off dividend recapitalization decisions. Moreover, releveraging influences the solution to the controlling-outside shareholder conflict and applies enhanced disciplinary pressure on the controlling shareholder. A self-regulation mechanism is identified that constrains the appropriation of private benefits. This self-regulation mechanism will develop differently according to the contractual frameworks of incentivizing benefits. We derive practical and testable implications.","Creditors’ holdup, releveraging and the setting of private appropriation in a control contract between shareholders",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000478,10 September 2021,2021,Research Article,64.0

While widely used, IRT models are often misapplied, and a key element of their estimation, the item parameters, are almost always ignored and discarded. In this paper, we look into the application of IRT models to the estimation of judicial ideology scores by Martin and Quinn (2002). Building off of a replication and extension of Martin and Quinn (2002), we demonstrate that the often-ignored item parameters are, in fact, inconsistent with the assumptions of IRTs. Then, using a post-estimation fix that is designed to ameliorate the problem, we run the model again, generating new scores. We then compare our new ideal points to the existing ideal points and discuss the implications for both ideal point modeling generally and in judicial politics specifically. We conclude by replicating a prominent study in judicial politics that demonstrates how inconsistencies in the estimation of IRT models can be consequential and bring up concerns with the implications for what this could mean for the usefulness of scores estimated via IRT models.","Latent concepts and measurements are ubiquitous in political science, law, and economics. Because the core assumption in any paradigm of thought must be about concepts that we fundamentally cannot observe (Lakatos, 1976), such as preferences, ideology, or aptitude — there are extensive literatures devoted to how precisely we can measure their shadow on the real world, such as by observing people’s choices. Since the highly influential work of Poole and Rosenthal, 1991, Poole and Rosenthal, 2000, numerous scholars have used spatial voting models to estimate ideological preferences from roll-call votes and other choice data; these measures and models are often vital to significant swaths of the literature in American and comparative politics (Imai et al., 2016) and law.====A widely used method to measure these latent traits is the item response theory model (IRT). These models, borrowing from literature developed in education testing and psychometrics, are a relatively fast way of fitting a latent trait model on diverse sets of choice data that arise from different choice environments. IRT methods have been applied to study: public opinion formation (Treier and Sunshine Hillygus, 2009; Tausanovitch and Warshaw, 2014), the ideology of actors in political institutions (Clinton et al., 2004; Martin and Quinn, 2002; Bonica, 2014), aggregation of expert rating models (Clinton and Lapinski, 2006; Treier and Jackman, 2008; Linzer and Staton, 2012) among many others.====Many of these approaches, however, disregard an important output of the IRT model that is vital to understanding the model’s fit. Because of this disregard, IRT models are often used in a way that violates the fundamental assumptions of the IRT models and the estimates of latent traits. In this paper, we argue the main limitation to existing IRT models used in service of ideal point estimation in judicial politics is a misspecification of item parameters.==== We will show that the choice of test questions to measure unobserved aptitude, the purpose of which IRT was created, may not be a good analogy to voting and ideology. In particular, we will show that we need to pay better attention to the ‘item’ part of the IRT models if we are to limit (or eliminate) bias in our measures.====In the sections that follow, we present and discuss the exact formulation of IRT models, how they are used in political science and legal scholarship, and the development of the Martin and Quinn’s (2002) Dynamic Ideal Point Model, the most widely used ideal point model in the study of judicial politics and law. We then demonstrate the bias in their estimates and correct these estimates for the problems we identify. We then follow this by replicating two recent studies of judicial behavior using our new judicial ideology scores. We then show that the specification and construction of judicial ideology scores do indeed impact empirical models of judicial behavior. We follow this with our reservations about assuming that judicial ideology is unidimensional and we suggest improvements that can be made within the political science latent scale modeling literature more broadly.",The efficacy of measuring judicial ideal points: The mis-analogy of IRTs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000442,28 August 2021,2021,Research Article,65.0

As a methodical innovation, we calculate coalition-based screens by forming coalitions of bidders in tenders to flag bid-rigging ====. Using Swiss, Japanese and Italian procurement data, we investigate the effectiveness of our method in different countries and auction settings, in our cases first-price sealed-bid and mean-price sealed-bid auctions. We correctly classify 90% of the collusive and competitive coalitions when applying four machine learning algorithms: lasso, support vector machine, random forest, and super learner ensemble method. Finally, we find that coalition-based screens for the variance and the uniformity of bids are in all the cases the most important predictors according to the random forest.","Bid rigging conspiracies cost governments and taxpayers billions of dollars every year, given that OECD countries spend about 12% of their GDP on public procurement.==== According to the OECD, the elimination of bid rigging could help reduce procurement prices by 20% or even more. Developing proactive methods for uncovering bid-rigging conspiracies is therefore of prime importance for competition and procurement agencies all over the world. Proactive statistical methods to detect bid rigging in public procurement have initially been proposed by, for example, Harrington (2008) and Porter and Zona (1993). The more recent literature discusses the application of a wide range of methods to expose bid-rigging cartels in Brazil (Lima and Resende, 2021), Canada (Clark et al., 2018), Japan (Chassang et al., 2020), Sweden (Bergman et al., 2020) and Switzerland (Huber and Imhof, 2019, Imhof, 2019).====In this paper, we add to this literature by proposing an original method of detection that focuses on coalitions formed by groups of firms. We apply our method to three different data sets from Japan, Switzerland and Italy for which the incidence of bid rigging is known. In all three countries, we find that on average our method correctly classifies nine coalitions out of ten as collusive or competitive. The results remain robust in different auction formats, such as first-price sealed-bid procurement mechanism in Japan and Switzerland and the mean-price sealed-bid auction in Italy. Our suggested method of detection is thus able to flag collusive groups of firms (collusive coalitions) from different bid-rigging cartels: (i) when all firms in a tender rig the contract, as in Japan and Switzerland (Ishii, 2014, Huber and Imhof, 2019, Imhof, 2019); (ii) when collusive firms face competitive firms, as in Italy and in Switzerland (see Conley and Decarolis, 2016, Wallimann et al., 2020); and (iii) when a cartel is active mostly in only one region of a market, and the firms rig only a subset of contracts (see Imhof et al., 2018).====Our method of detection is based on screens, that is, statistics derived from the distribution of bids in a tender. To derive screens for coalitions, we start by selecting three firms and isolate all the tenders in which those three firms submitted a bid. For each tender, we calculate the screens based exclusively on the three bids of those firms obtaining the tender-based screens for a coalition. We then calculate the descriptive statistics of the tender-based screens, including the mean, median, minimum and maximum for each coalition. These statistics, henceforth called ’coalition-based screens’, synthetize the distributional features of bids for a specific coalition. Since we use data from different bid-rigging cases with complete information, we can identify a coalition as competitive and collusive in order to build the outcome variable. We focus on coalitions of three firms since we aim to detect even small bid-rigging cartels. Focusing on coalitions of two firms would impede the application of most of our screens, and with coalitions of four firms or more it would hinder the detection of the smallest bid-rigging cartels formed by three firms.====As in recent studies (Foremny et al., 2018, Rabuzin and Modrusan, 2019, García Rodríguez et al., 2020, Silveira et al., 2021), we use machine learning to train and test models to flag bid-rigging cartels. For this purpose, machine learning is ideal since it focuses on developing predictive models to determine an outcome. Machine learning does not focus on the causal structural relationship, e.g., between collusion and the distributional pattern of bids. In other words, we remain agnostic about the effects of bid rigging on the distribution of bids when using machine learning techniques. However, we discuss the effects of bid rigging on coalition-based screens by illustrating some common important predictors in all the cases being considered. In our study, we combine the coalition-based screens described above with machine learning to predict whether a coalition of firms colluded in bidding or not. To train predictive models and evaluate their goodness of fit in independent test sets, we apply four widely used machine learning algorithms: the random forest (Breiman, 2001), the lasso (Frank and Friedman, 1993, Tibshirani, 1996), the support vector machines (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), and the ”super learner” ensemble method, including random forest, neural networks, gradient boosting, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression (van der Laan et al., 2008).====We first apply our coalition-based approach to the Okinawa bid-rigging cartel from Japan (see also Ishii, 2014, Huber et al., 2020). The four machine learning algorithms offer correct classification rates from 91.9% to 94.9% to classify a coalition as collusive or competitive. In addition, changing the perspective from a tender-based approach to a coalition-based approach increases the correct classification rate of three to six percentage points, corresponding to a decrease of between 27% and 55% in the error rate, defined as one minus the correct classification rate. Secondly, we implement our coalition-based approach on Swiss bid-rigging cartels (see also Huber and Imhof, 2019, Wallimann et al., 2020), and we find correct classification rates from 86.9% to 90.5%. The increase in the correct classification rates using a coalition-based approach amounts to four to seven percentage points when comparing the results of the various models applied to complete bid-rigging cartels, which in Wallimann et al. (2020) amounts approximately to 83%. Our coalition-based approach therefore reduces the error rate by between 23% and 44%, inclusive. Finally, we apply our coalition-based approach to Italian bid-rigging cartels (see also Conley and Decarolis, 2016) and find correct classification rates from 84.8% to 90.1% for flagging collusive coalitions. For the three different countries, we find that the medians of the coefficient of variation, the spread and the KS-statistic are the most powerful predictors for flagging collusive coalitions. While the levels of the medians strongly differ between the cases, the effect of bid rigging on the screens goes in the same direction, and its magnitude is to a certain extent similar. Therefore, benchmarks in screening other markets in other countries should rely on the effect of bid rigging. For example, a decrease by a factor of two in the medians of the spread and the coefficient of variation would indicate potential competitive issues requiring further scrutiny.====We complement our analyses in three steps using the Swiss data. First, we add more summary statistics for the tender-based screens. With an enlarged set of coalitions-based screens, we find no significant improvement in the correct prediction rate, indicating that summary statistics based on the mean, median, minimum and maximum are sufficient to deliver a good performance in predicting collusive and competitive coalitions. Second, we discuss why coalition-based screens for the variance and the uniformity of bids perform significantly better than those for the asymmetry of bids. We find that applying only screens for the asymmetry of bids to the Swiss data (omitting the coalition-based screens for the variance and uniformity of bids) produces a poor correct prediction rate. This might be due to the fact that, by forming a coalition (with few firms), the bid of the designated winner and thus the distance between the winning bid and the second lowest bid from the cartel is not systematically considered. Therefore, the asymmetry in the coalition's distribution of bids decreases. Finally, we investigate the performance of coalition-based screens formed with two firms. The results indicate a decrease in the correct prediction rates, especially for the competitive coalitions.====Our paper relates to other studies using screens for uncovering cartels (see Abrantes-Metz et al., 2006, Abrantes-Metz et al., 2012, Esposito and Ferrero, 2006, Hueschelrath, 2014, Jimenez and Perdiguero, 2012, Huber and Imhof, 2019, Imhof, 2019). Calculating screens for subgroups as in our approach is also discussed by Conley and Decarolis (2016) and Chassang et al. (2020). First, Conley and Decarolis (2016) calculate subgroups to detect cartels in collusive auctions in Italy. In order to identify collusive bidders, we similarly rely on the bids observed in a tender. However, we do not consider firm-specific covariates, such as common owner, municipality or country, to determine subgroups, as proposed in the study by Conley and Decarolis (2016). The advantage of our method is that we do not rely on firm-specific covariates, which could impede screening activity if firm-specific data are unavailable or if there is not enough time to collect them in secrecy without attracting the attention of potential cartel participants. Chassang et al. (2020) show that winning bids tend to be isolated when bidders collude. They calculate the difference between a bidder's own bid and the lowest bid submitted in a tender, therefore focusing on subgroups of two bids to calculate the distribution of differences. However, we do not focus solely on subgroups consisting of only the lowest bid in a tender and one of its opposing bidders.====More broadly, our study can be linked to papers on detecting bid-rigging cartels not relying on screens. One seminal paper by Bajari and Ye (2003) proposes two econometric tests for classifying pairs of firms as collusive. Subsequent papers apply and refine the econometric tests suggested by Bajari and Ye (2003) (see Jakobsson, 2007, Aryal and Gabrielli, 2013, Chotibhongs and Arditi, 2012a, Chotibhongs and Arditi, 2012b, Imhof, 2017, Bergman et al., 2020). Imhof (2017), however, questions the performance of the econometric tests proposed by Bajari and Ye (2003) for detecting the Ticino cartel because econometric tests produce too many false negatives by failing to classify pairs of firms as collusive, whereas the screens perform well in detecting the Ticino cartel. Our research is also associated with papers analyzing the effect of bid rigging (Pesendorfer, 2000, Ishii, 2009, Clark et al., 2018) and to papers investigating the change in bidding patterns when bid rigging occurs (Porter and Zona, 1993, Porter and Zona, 1999).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines our method of detection. In Section 3, we apply our detection method to public procurement datasets from Italy, Japan and Switzerland. We also discuss the observed variance screens and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which are important in flagging bid-rigging cartels. Section 4 performs complementary analyses. In Section 5, we discuss the advantages and policy implications of our approach.

Recently there has been much debate among ==== stakeholders on how changes to these laws will affect consumer choices. We develop an index to measure purchase diversity for alcoholic beverages that considers similarities in product attributes. Following a set of households that moved between regulatory environments during the 2004 to 2016 period, we examine the effect of alcohol availability on purchase diversity. Our key finding shows that consumers further diversify their product selections in states that allow alcohol sales in grocery stores.","Consumers seek variety for novelty and change (McAlister and Pessemier, 1982). To avoid satiation derived from repeated consumption of products and attributes, consumers do activities to achieve the optimal stimulation level from the behavior itself in the absence of external incentives (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1992, Van Trijp and Steenkamp, 1992). Such exploratory behaviors are more associated with psycho-social and feeling-based motivations rather than for rational and economic decision-making reasons (Sharma et al., 2010). However, behaviors in varied consumption are also highly affected by resources and constraints facing consumers. Consumers may choose to maximize their overall utility by increasing the diversity in their choices for goods or services as a response to changes in retail environments (Kahn, 1995, Mohan et al., 2012). Research on demand for variety has examined drivers behind varied choice patterns including convenience (Bronnenberg, 2015) and socio-economic characteristics (Gronau and Hamermesh, 2008, Jekanowski and Binkley, 2000). Our research focuses on how regulation governing the retail availability of alcoholic beverages influences consumer's choice making behavior. We focus on the U.S. market for alcohol given that the retail availability of different beverages varies across states and there are a plethora of choices for beer, wine, and spirits available to consumers.====The regulatory environment for alcohol allows states to establish rules within their borders on the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages. Some states require that alcoholic beverages are sold in specific stores while other states allow alcoholic beverages to be sold in all stores that sell food including grocery stores, convenience stores, big box stores, drug stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. There are 12 states allowing only limited (or no) alcohol sales in grocery stores, 5 states allowing only beer sales, and 16 states that allow the sale of wine and beer in grocery stores. The remaining 18 states allow beer, wine, and spirits to be sold across a wide range of outlets including grocery stores (Rickard et al., 2013, National Alcohol Beverage Control Association, 2016). States prohibiting alcohol sales in grocery stores may limit shopping convenience by requiring separate trips and increased travel costs for households (Food Marketing Institute, 2012). For states permitting grocery store sales of alcohol, it generates the utility of one-stop shopping in purchasing both groceries and alcohol in the same store and within the same trip (Seo, 2019).====In recent years, there have been several state legislative proposals to introduce wine and/or beer (and in some cases spirits) into grocery stores. Such bills have generated much debate over how wider availability of alcohol would affect business owners and consumers (Zimmerman, 2016, Asimov, 2009). One side of the argument maintains that expanding the retail availability for alcoholic beverages increases shopping convenience and increase choices available to consumers. Another side contends that greater availability of alcohol in grocery stores would lead to less assortment for consumers and reduce their visits to specialized stores. Byrne and Nizovtsev (2017) examined the effects of retail restrictions on local economy performance and suggested that restrictive retail laws may have moderate effects on the grocery store sector. However, within this debate and within the current literature, much less attention has been given to evaluating how the availability of alcoholic beverages in grocery stores affects purchase diversity among consumers.====In the next section, we provide more background details on the regulation concerning alcohol retail availability in the United States. We describe our household-level dataset and our development of a diversification index that incorporates similarities between distinct products to capture the level of diversification in household purchases over multiple shopping trips. We then provide a conceptual framework that characterizes consumer behavior in the utility maximization problem to understand the purchase diversity pattern for differentiated products considering the implicit travel and search costs associated with alcohol purchases under different regulatory environments. Focusing on a subsample of households that moved across regulatory environments (presumably for reasons not related to alcohol availability laws) enables us to identify the causal impact of allowing wider alcohol availability in retail stores on consumer purchase diversity. Our findings show that there has been greater purchase diversity for beer, wine, and spirits in states that allow alcoholic beverages to be sold in a wider range of retail channels.",Regulation and purchase diversity: Empirical evidence from the U.S. alcohol market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000326,13 August 2021,2021,Research Article,67.0

In this case, making FTCs more flexible during downturns may be useful. We assess this idea by examining the effects of a law that increased the maximum duration of FTCs in Portugal during the 2012 recession. Our analysis is based on regression-discontinuity and difference-in-differences methods and employer-employee panel data. We find a considerable take up of this measure, as conversions to permanent contracts drop by 20%. Worker churning is reduced, as mobility of eligible fixed-term workers to other firms drops by 10%. Employment also increases but only for younger workers.","Labour market institutions are shaped by multiple parameters that establish how they operate in practice. These parameters include the replacement ratio of unemployment benefits, the amount of severance pay, the Kaitz index of minimum wages, and many other aspects. This paper presents and discusses the case for greater responsiveness of such parameters with respect to the conditions of the labour market. We argue that instead of enshrining parameters in the law and then adjusting them on a case-by-case basis, it may be useful to establish rules determining varying values of these different parameters depending on the macroeconomic context. We argue that this approach may serve as a tool to reduce the employment volatility of business cycles.====To our knowledge this approach – letting labour regulations respond to the business cycle – has only received some attention in the case of unemployment benefits. These have been extended in periods of high unemployment (see Hagedorn et al. (2016) and its references for the evaluations of the U.S. case), as recently in the context of the pandemic recession. However, we argue that it may be fruitful to work towards ‘Taylor's rules’ Taylor (1993), Martins (2021b) for many other labour market institutions than unemployment benefits. Collective bargaining, activation, employment protection laws, and other labour market institutions can also have significant effects OECD (2014) and benefit from greater responsiveness to the business cycle. These are institutions that already exhibit considerable international and, occasionally, within-country variability, through legal reforms.====The specific empirical evidence that we present here, in relation to the more general case above, is derived from the effects of a temporary increase in the flexibility of fixed-term contracts (FTCs, henceforth) in recessions. We consider the particular case of the maximum duration of FTCs, another parameter that exhibits considerable international variation. For instance, in France, such maximum duration is 18 months in the general case, further varying from 9 to 24 months, depending on the nature of the contract OECD (2014). In Spain and the UK, the maximum duration is 48 months, while in other countries with generally more flexible employment laws, including Poland and the US, there is no limit at all.====Of course, FTCs have received considerable attention in the academic literature, in particular in the context of the debates on the costs and benefits of FTCs and, more generally, about labour market segmentation Booth et al. (2002), Blanchard and Landier (2002), Bentolila et al. (2012), Garcia Perez et al. (2019). Although FTCs tend to be associated with a large number of negative outcomes (wages, training, productivity, health, etc.), this may reflect selection effects concerning the different profiles of firms and or workers that participate in such contracts. On the other hand, by potentially facilitating the creation of jobs (compared to the case of sometimes more cumbersome permanent contracts), FTCs may increase employment, particularly for the young. FTCs may also potentially reduce the number of even more informal alternative relationships, such as individual contractors or service providers, who are not regulated by labour law at all. The literature above has also discussed different motivations for FTCs, which we group and describe below, in terms of screening, bargaining/incentives, insurance and uncertainty drivers. However, we do not know of any studies that examine the effects of specific parameters of FTCs, such as their maximum duration, as we do in this paper. Our approach focused on the analysis of specific components of labour regulations can therefore be useful in bridging the gaps between academics and policy makers.====This paper conducts an evaluation of a reform of FTCs implemented in Portugal in 2012, in the midst of a recession. This reform involved an increase in the maximum duration of FTCs, from three years to up to four and a half years. The reform was also designed in such a way that only some workers already in FTCs were eligible. In particular, only those hired sufficiently late to hit the old maximum duration once the new law was in force could be subject to the extended duration, a fact which we exploit for identification purposes. Drawing on matched employer-employee longitudinal data and regression discontinuity Hahn et al. (2001) and difference-in-differences methods, we evaluate the effects of the reform in terms of different outcomes of interest, including contract conversion, employment, and inter-firm (job-to-job) mobility probabilities. We find that all of these outcomes are affected, with large drops in conversions to permanent contract, an increase in employment (although only for young workers), and a decrease in worker churning or mobility to other firms. We also regard these results as supportive of our idea of greater responsiveness in labour regulations with respect to the business cycle.====The structure of the paper is as follows: the next Section presents the FTC reform. Section 3 presents the data sets and their descriptive statistics. The main results on both take up and outcomes of interest are presented in Section 4.

Ramelli and Wagner (2020) and Fahlenbrach et al. (2020) find that the fall in stock prices following the COVID-19 outbreak was less significant for less leveraged firms and those with higher cash ratios. Furthermore, Joseph et al. (2020) show that firms with high cash levels performed significantly better during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). However, higher cash levels mean higher costs for the firm. Moreover, a firms’ cash levels may determine the management's bargaining power in negotiations with labor unions. According to the transaction cost economics (TCE) theory (Williamson, 1979), management should adjust the level of cash to optimize its bargaining position with the unions. In other words, the costs of cash levels are the transaction costs of the contract with the labor union, and it determines the contractual commitment of the parties to some extent.====Labor unions have long been a subject of controversy in the economics literature. In their seminal paper, Freeman and Medoff (1984) present two contrary views on labor unions that could prompt firms to adopt contradictory financial strategies. According to them, unions have a positive side in that they negotiate with employers for better terms and wages for employees. However, these gains are most likely to be at the cost of firms’ profit, which will decrease from increased staff costs. Managements may therefore decide to adopt cash policies for their companies that would give them a better bargaining position in wage negotiation with labor unions. The idea is quite simple: the bargaining power of unions would be lower when the firm has low cash reserves (Klasa et al., 2009).====The negative side of unions is that they act as a cartel and use their bargaining power to raise the wages of employees beyond competitive levels. Furthermore, the wages in unionized firms are becoming more rigid, raising the operating risks of firms (Chen et al., 2011). Cavanaugh (1998) argues that unionized workers acquire property rights over jobs. Thus, they can appropriate a portion of the quasi-rents generated from their employer's relationship specific investments in the firm's assets. Consequently, Cavanaugh (1998) also reports that as union density increases, firms exhibit lower profitability, investment, and employee growth. Additionally, these detrimental effects increase as the degree of asset specificity becomes larger because the assets become more non-redeployable to another user or use, thereby increasing the captured quasi-rents. Managements can respond to their increased risks by adopting more financial flexibility, or, in other words, maintaining higher cash levels. Moreover, by maintaining higher cash levels, managements make more credible their implied promises to employees (Gao et al., 2013).====These two contrasting views on labor unions represent the different effects of unions on firms’ strategic financial policy choice. Freeman and Medoff (1984) argue that the positive impact of labor unions outweigh the negative consequences. Bryson (2014) shows that unions continue to generate a wage premium and reduce despite declining bargaining power. He points out that for the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) a union membership wage premium vary between 10% to 15%, while for five European countries the union wage premium is zero or not significantly different from zero. This effect is mainly due to the fact that unions are also able to determine wage outcome in the non union sectors by collectively bargained rates. Bryson (2014) argue that although the wage premium has declined in developed countries in recent years, it remains sizable and statistically significant for most groups of employees. Thus, the study document that companies strived to improve their bargaining position in recent years.====Klasa et al. (2009) examined the industry data on unionization, to find strong support for the bargaining hypothesis. They suggest that the US firms facing persistent demands from powerful unions hold lower cash reserves to improve their bargaining position and protect their profits from such demands. However, Schmalz (2015) proposes that the causal effect of unionization on cash and debt levels is heterogeneous across US firms. He finds large (small) financially constrained US firms reducing (increasing) their cash levels but increasing (reducing) their leverage. Thus, the empirical evidence that firms strategically hold less cash in unionized firms to improve their bargain position remains ambiguous.====This paper re-examines the effect of labor unions on firms’ cash holdings using unique data and a new conceptual framework that more accurately predicts the relation between unionization and cash holdings. Our framework is based on studies such as Klasa et al. (2009) that indicate that firm managements use cash holding policies to improve their bargaining power when negotiating with unionized workers. In contrast to studies in the literature, we use firm-level labor union data of a large sample of firms across 29 countries for the period from 2004 to 2015. From the firm-level financial position and unionization data, we document that the average firm responds to increases in unionization rate by decreasing its corporate cash holdings. This is consistent with the bargaining hypothesis, according to which companies strategically decrease their cash holdings to counter the rise in employees’ bargaining power due to increased unionization. The reported effect is symmetric in that firms respond to an increase (decrease) in unionization rate by decreasing (increasing) their cash buffers. Moreover, we investigate whether the effects of unionization on cash holdings are heterogeneous across firms. We find that unionization has a very strong negative effect on the cash ratios of labor-intensive, large, high-growth, profitable, and low labor productive firms. Furthermore, we find that a better quality of countries’ institutions intensifies the documented relationship. We argue that the results using the subsample analyses based on countries’ quality of institutions provides additional evidence to the TCE theory. This is because our results show that changes in the firms’ and government's institutional environment affect the bargaining position of the contracting parties. These results support the arguments of Williamson (2000), who states that transactions are more difficult to conduct in countries with low quality institutions.====Next, we conduct an event study using the treatment effect estimation to isolate the endogeneity concerns. We employ the systematic banking crisis that results in increased firm unionization and investigate its impact on cash levels using a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy. We find that during a systematic banking crisis, the cash level of firms’ declines more relative to the control group countries. Hence, the results of the event study support our hypothesis that the increased unionization results in lower cash levels. Moreover, the results provide further evidence to the TCE theory as the existing literature shows that labor unions strengthen because of a financial crisis (Kim and Kim, 2003). Furthermore, crisis periods are associated with high uncertainty which further increases transaction costs. Thus, in crisis periods, firms try to improve their bargain power with the unions by further lowering their cash levels. However, this strategy is risky as recent research shows that firms with higher cash levels are able to improve their competitive position during the recovery phase (Joseph et al., 2020).====To gain a higher degree of certainty that our interpretation of the firm-level results is correct, we address causality and endogeneity concerns, and consequently, exclude other explanations for the identified empirical patterns. Regarding the issue of causality, we use a dynamic model analysis and a placebo test. If our results are accidental or are driven by factors that are unaccounted for, a placebo test will falsify our findings. We re-estimate firm-level models based on random assignments of labor changes to firms. We find that neither of our conclusions is falsified by this test as statistically significant coefficients lie outside the bootstrap confidence intervals. Consequently, the results of the placebo test are consistent with the view that the changes in labor union and cash levels have a causal relationship.====We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we expand the TCE theory by showing that the firm's management attempts to appropriate their position by increasing their bargaining position using cash. Williamson (1994) elaborates that TCE applies to contracting problems related directly, or indirectly, to a wide range of areas including labor organization, corporate governance, and finance. In the law and finance literature, the transaction costs perspective has been applied to explain theoretical decisions regarding contracts with labor unions. Williamson (1979) classifies the transaction as idiosyncratic; however, as far as we know, it has never been used in empirical work.====Second, we build on and complement Klasa et al. (2009) by confirming that unionized firms hold less cash. However, we extend Klasa et al. (2009) by using a cross-country sample of firm-level unionization data. Specifically, our variable covers the changes in employees’ unionization as well as number of employees under collective bargaining agreements. Klasa et al. (2009) argue that firms strive to improve their bargaining position in negotiations with labor unions because labor costs generally account for a large part of a firm's total costs. Thus, our measure better captures the relationship between a firm and its labor unions because an increase in wages affects both the employees in a union as well as those under a collective bargaining agreement. Moreover, the effect of unionization on cash levels depends on the firm characteristics. Furthermore, unionization affects the cash levels of companies through collective bargaining. This is stronger in labor-intensive, large, high-growth, and low labor productive firms because the labor unions of these companies have more power; this also explains the different labor union effects on cash.====Third, a cross-country sample allows us to analyze how the countries’ institutions affect the association between unionization and corporate cash holdings. To the best our knowledge, this is the first study to show that unionization of workers affects the firm's cash holding polices, and that this effect is stronger in countries with high institutional quality. We believe that the bargaining power of unions and employees in countries with low institutional quality is weak, and that therefore companies in such countries do not need to improve their bargaining position against organized labor. In other words, companies ignore the unions in such countries, as can be seen in the literature.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the related literature and develops our hypothesis. Section 3 discusses our sample and empirical design. Section 4 presents the results of the main tests as well as a battery of sensitivity tests. The results of additional analyses are presented in Section 5.

Appellate judges may react to criminal reform by changing their rates of judgements that are favorable to defendants and, depending on the judge type, responses run in different directions and with variable intensity. This study offers detailed estimates of such responses and interprets them in the light of the literature on the determinants of judicial decision-making, which resorts not only on legal factors but also on the ideology, personal attributes and strategic behavior of judges. According to the Brazilian constitution, 10% of the seats in appellate courts must be filled by formerly practicing lawyers and 10% by former prosecutors, both by executive appointment. The remaining 80% are reserved for career judges. In addition to these appointments, appellate panels also rely heavily on judges sitting by designation, who acted as rapporteurs, between 2009 and 2013, in as many as 14% of all criminal appeals in the state court of São Paulo, which is the subject of the analysis. A large dataset of criminal appeals related to drug offenses and the exogenous assignment of cases allow identifying the causal effects of career backgrounds on the response of appellate judges to the shift in drug jurisprudence. Estimates of the effect of judge types on appellate case outcomes, conditional on case characteristics and judging panel-specific effects, confirm that career judges are more likely to rule in favor of defendants, in line with the shift in jurisprudence. Former prosecutors and sitting judges seem to react against the shift, by increasing their rate of rulings against defendants. Former lawyers tend to exhibit mixed behavior, possibly resulting from a combination of liberal attitudes and strategic behavior, in deference to policy preferences of the executive branch.","This paper presents a quantitative assessment of the effect of a major shift in criminal jurisprudence on defendants’ chances of winning appeals in drug offense cases, depending on the career path of appellate judges in the state court of São Paulo, Brazil. Different types of appellate judges are likely to respond in different directions and with variable intensity to changes in law and jurisprudence. This study attempts to quantify these responses in detail, and interpret them in the light of the literature on the determinants of judicial decision-making, which rely on a combination of legal factors, ideology, personal attributes and strategic behavior of judges.====In 2006, Brazil enacted a new drug law (Law 11343 of 2006) to increase the punishment for serious drug trafficking offenses. The new law established (a) an increase in prison sentencing, from 3 to 8 years to 5 to 15 years, along with a tenfold increase in minimum day-fines; (b) a reduction of incarceration by as much as 3 years and 4 months, in cases qualified as privileged trafficking, defined as offenses committed by first-time offenders with a clean criminal record who are not gang members (art. 33, ==== 4====); (c) the prohibition of conversion of incarceration under any circumstances (art. 44). The purpose of Law 11343 was to increase sentences for serious drug offenses on the one hand and, on the other, to provide shorter sentences for minor drug offenses to reduce pressure on the overcrowded prison system. Law 11343 lacked, however, objective parameters for the specification of the offense, i.e., drug use (art. 28) versus drug trafficking. As a result, studies show, based on the official data, that more individuals were sentenced to longer terms, thus contributing to the ballooning of the numbers incarcerated due to drug offenses (from 31,520 in 2005, to 174,216 in 2014, or 9% to 28%, respectively, of the prison population, in Brazil.====). On September 1, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled on the unconstitutionality of the prohibition of conversion of confinement (present both in art. 33, ==== 4==== and art. 44 of the New Drug Law).==== This ruling was a persuasive precedent, but later on, through Resolution No. 5 of February 16, 2012, the Federal Senate amended the code of criminal procedure, thus suppressing the unconstitutional provision.====A basic question that arises is how such a major change in the criminal jurisprudence regime affected defendants’ prospects in criminal appeals. Intuitively, one would expect that defendants would be better off across the board because of the adherence to a new, more flexible precedent on criminal sentencing, which considers alternatives to incarceration. A more interesting question is whether the impact of the shift in jurisprudence depends on the type of judge assigned as the rapporteur. The institutional setting of Brazilian appellate courts offers an opportunity to tackle these questions because these courts exhibit a variety of appellate judge types.====According to the federal constitution, 80% of appellate court seats must be filled by career judges and 10% by former lawyers and former prosecutors, by means of executive appointments. In addition to these appointments, the numbers from 2009 to 2013 show that appellate panels also rely heavily on judges sitting by designation, who acted as rapporteurs in as many as 14% of all criminal appeals in São Paulo.====But why exactly would appointed or designated judges behave differently from career, appellate judges? Gubernatorial appointments are the result of a political process which involves the court, the executive branch, and the institutions with which candidates are affiliated. In order to secure a seat at the bench, prosecutors and lawyers must first be selected by their peer delegates within powerful committees, which define a list of six candidates. A board of appellate judges then votes for three names out of the six and submits them to the state governor for a final decision. Due to the workings of this political process, most accounts emphasize the risks it poses to judicial independence: a viable candidate for an appointment needs to balance the interests of their own institution, of the court and, of the executive branch.==== Criminal policy is sensitive to the executive branch because security is a key issue for the average (conservative) voter, who supports a tough-on-crime stance vis-à -vis drug offenses.====To the extent that gubernatorial appointments represent their parent institutions, former prosecutors are expected to rule more favorably for the prosecution, either out of respect, gratitude, or deference to their own institution. Their views of the criminal system are stricter, and, indeed, the ==== regularly publishes their strict guidelines (called “theses”) for interpreting changes to statutes or jurisprudence.==== Similarly, former lawyers are likely to adopt a stance congruent with the institutional views of the Brazilian bar association (====) and its political agenda, which, in addition to civil, constitutional, and human rights, focuses on safeguarding due process of law==== and protecting access to justice. Both careers have exhibited a strong ==== in Brazil. However, the contrast among such backgrounds is recognized even within high members of the Court.====District judges sitting by designation do not retain the prerogatives of appellate judges and may be removed at the discretion of the Special Council of the TJSP. Their behavior, both in terms of efficiency (i.e., their ability to dispose of cases and reduce backlogs) as well as in terms of agreeing with the court's most preferred policies, can be decisive in terms of their chances of earning a permanent seat on the appellate court.====The empirical strategy involves comparing – before and after the jurisprudence shift – the percentage of cases decided in favor of the defendant in criminal appeals for each type of rapporteur: career judge, formerly practicing lawyer, former prosecutor, or district judge sitting by designation. Besides providing descriptive statistics, the paper establishes a judicial decision making-model, in which the outcome of the appeal depends on the career background as well as on a vector of case and court characteristics, including judging panel-specific effects. The exogenous rule for the assignment of cases among ==== entails a clear identification strategy: within each judging panel, the case assignment (that is, the choice of career background of the rapporteur) is exogenous, implying that non-observed factors related to the case outcome are orthogonal to the “treatment”. Randomization tests demonstrate that the design is appropriate. In addition, the paper shows that when selection effects are weaker, career backgrounds and ideology exhibit stronger effects on case outcomes. This result is consistent with the “integrated approach” to judicial decision making [Coggins (2008)], which considers, in a single model, the roles of both ideology [the attitudinal model, by Segal and Spaeth (2002)] and case selection [the ====, derived from a strategic model of litigation Priest and Klein (1984)] in determining observed case outcomes.====The institutional setup – a significant diversity in the backgrounds of appellate judges – coupled with a major, exogenous shift in jurisprudence on the highly salient issue of drug offenses, with a large dataset on criminal appeals, provides ideal conditions for an empirical study on the impact of exogenous legal changes and their interplay with ideology and strategic behavior of judges.====The new drug jurisprudence eliminates restrictions on alternative sanctions to incarceration, prison sentences, but does not impose a more forgiving treatment. Therefore, the first hypothesis of the paper is that more liberal judges (formerly practicing lawyers) will exhibit a more pronounced response to the shift in jurisprudence because of the initial wedge between their most preferred policy and legal, binding provisions. In contrast, conservative judges (former prosecutors) would exhibit a weaker response, simply because, from their perspective, the initial, legal restriction was not binding.==== Another part of this hypothesis concerns ==== [Freyens and Gong (2017)], defined as a judicial response that runs counter to the direction of the statutory or jurisprudential reform.====The second hypothesis of interest is that selection effects tend to blur the effect of ideology on judicial outcomes. If a specific judge retains jurisdiction over the prospective appeal, then litigants will gauge more precisely their chances of success prior to filing, whereas if the appeal is randomly assigned, then litigants will face greater uncertainty as to their chances of success. More specifically, the hypothesis is that the exclusion of appeals under retained jurisdiction from the sample weakens selection effects and strengthens the impact of ideology.====The third hypothesis concerns district judges sitting by designation. These judges are not appointed by the governor but are chosen by the Special Council of judges of the court. For many decades, the Court of São Paulo has been a conservative stronghold, supportive of a tough criminal policy; therefore, I expect these sitting judges to behave conservatively as well. But because they are not appellate judges, one would expect them to also factor in career concerns, which involve productivity (reducing backlogs) and performing according to sound legal standards. The hypothesis then, is that designated judges will mimic the behavior of more conservative judges (former prosecutors), albeit perhaps not as intensively and thus pushing them closer to neutral, career judges.====The main contributions of this paper are that (a) the unique institutional features of the selection of judges in Brazil entail a peculiar proxy for judicial ideology, which contains two entangled components, namely a strong ==== and a component of judicial politics, inherent to the nature of the appointment process; (b) this is one of the very few studies in the literature to evaluate the role of attitudes and strategic behavior in shaping ruling standards of appellate judges, based on an empirical framework that explores ==== in legal standards, rather than just comparing ==== of say, pro-defendant rulings, between different judge types==== ; (c) there is a well-established literature on the political and ideological motives underlying the behavior of Brazilian Supreme Court justices, but no empirical studies focusing on appellate courts, either at state or federal levels, even though they are responsible for a much larger caseload.====The next section presents an institutional background on the rules for the appointment of appellate judges in the court of São Paulo.

We develop a game-theoretic, continuous-time model of the leveraged firm under Chapter 11 to assess the ==== transfers and welfare impacts of such an amendment to the bankruptcy procedure. After fitting the model to Chapter 11 current outcomes, we show that the redemption option design overcompensates junior creditors, leading to different, but not less frequent, Absolute Priority Rule violations. Since the reform shifts negotiations from a three- to a two-player game, it reduces the scope for concessions in the bargaining process and raises the risk of liquidation. Importantly, the redemption option aligns junior creditors’ interests with those of shareholders, thereby increasing the incentives for risk-shifting prior to bankruptcy.","The resolution of corporate financial distress impacts on claimants’ recovery and on the future performance of reorganized firms. Ex ante, its perceived efficiency determines creditors’ trust in their contractual rights and, ultimately, the soundness of the credit market. In modern economies, the legal bankruptcy procedure plays an instrumental role in resolving corporate financial distress. For firms opting to restructure under the protection of the bankruptcy law, the procedure defines a set of rules under which claimholders can negotiate. It also stands as an enforceable alternative for distressed firms trying to reach an out-of-court agreement with their claimholders through a private workout. As emphasized by Aghion et al. (1992), the bankruptcy procedure is designed to facilitate the bargaining process among claimants to avoid costly liquidation, while at the same time respecting initial contractual agreements as much as possible. In that spirit, empirical studies on the U.S. bankruptcy procedure (reorganization under Chapter 11, or liquidation under Chapter 7) have assessed its performance along the following dimensions: its duration, its liquidation rate, the creditors’ recovery, and the deviations from the Absolute Priority Rule (APR) it entails.====This paper examines the impact, along those same dimensions, of an amendment to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This amendment, which was recently proposed by the American Bankruptcy Institute (ABI), introduces a ====.==== The ABI justifies the reform by pointing out that financially distressed corporations have been relying less and less on Chapter 11, often preferring faster and less costly out-of-court restructuring. Detailed excerpts from ABI (2014) explaining the redemption option can be found in Appendix A. Under the proposed change, a junior creditor is entitled to a share of the ongoing company, called the redemption option value, corresponding to the possibility of a post-bankruptcy increase in value of the debtors’ assets above the amount of the senior claims. Specifically, the junior creditor's share is “the value of a hypothetical option to purchase the entire firm with an exercise price equal to the redemption price [====] and a duration equal to the redemption period” (ABI, 2014, p. 209). The redemption price (i.e., the exercise price of the call option) is defined as “the full face amount of the claims of the senior class”. The redemption period ends at “the third anniversary of the petition date”. In other words, the junior creditor would receive the value of the call option written on the firm's assets with a strike price equal to the senior debt face value and a maturity of three years.==== That value could be paid “in the form of cash, debt, stock, warrants, or other consideration”, and it could be determined “through generally accepted market-based valuation models, including the Black-Scholes option pricing model”.====Following the publication of the ABI report, a burgeoning literature has emerged, examining the ramifications of the ABI's proposals. Recent papers summarize these proposals and explain how changes could potentially reduce the length of the reorganization process (see, e.g., PIMCO, 2015 and Wessels and de Weijs, 2015). Aside from its benefits, the ABI reform could potentially disadvantage senior creditors by limiting their rights to be paid in full before junior creditors, and could also disadvantage junior creditors by limiting their ability to veto an organization plan and delay the reorganization process; according to Adler and Triantis (2017), the ABI reform represents a significant reallocation of the rights the claimants would have enjoyed outside of bankruptcy.====The empirical literature has examined other reforms undergone by the U.S. bankruptcy procedure, most notably the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act==== and the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA). Franks and Torous (1989), Bebchuk (2002), and Adler et al. (2013), among others, find that the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act induced lower bankruptcy costs and stronger ex ante debtor protection, which caused more distressed firms to seek protection under Chapter 11. But these authors also document a lengthy and costly reorganization process, with frequent deviations from the APR. Teloni (2015) shows that the BAPCPA resulted in shorter Chapter 11 cases, and, at the same time, increased the reliance of firms on prepackaged bankruptcy. The author also notes an increase in the fraction of firms that soon refile for Chapter 11. Warren and Westbrook (2008), however, find that the 2005 reform produced little effect on the length of the Chapter 11 procedure.====By contrast to such ex post investigations and to the legal academic literature, we study the potential consequences of the redemption option by relying on a contingent-claims model of the financially distressed firm.==== In the spirit of Annabi et al. (2012), we analyze Chapter 11 negotiations as a non-cooperative game played between three classes of claimants (equity holders and senior and junior creditors). Our model is then adapted to a situation akin to the implementation of the proposed ABI reform: as the distressed firm files for bankruptcy, junior creditors are offered a lump sum value (e.g., the redemption option) and exit the negotiation game, while equity holders and senior creditors bargain over the remaining value of the firm. The evaluation of the redemption option therefore involves comparing the outcome of a negotiation game involving three players, where claimants have different priorities and can veto a reorganization plan, to a negotiation game involving two players, where proposals may have a “take it or leave it” flavour, under the supervision of the Court.====Our main findings are the following. As expected, granting the redemption option value to the junior creditors reduces the duration of the bankruptcy procedure and the total bankruptcy costs. Also as intended, the proposed reform favours unsecured claims at the expense of senior claims. While the overall fairness of the bankruptcy procedure is not improved, the proposed reform operates a shift in APR violations: those at the expense of senior creditors become the most frequent. We find that the redemption option, as it is currently designed, is an overly generous compensation for junior creditors, who are paid in full in most scenarios; the wealth transfers among creditors can nonetheless be reduced by allowing a smaller fraction of the redemption option value to junior creditors.====However, removing one of the claimant from the negotiation process has consequences that go beyond the wealth transfer and the shortening of the procedure intended by the proposed reform. We find that it results in an increase in the risk of liquidation, as senior creditors and equity holders are left in a more difficult position to negotiate a reorganization agreement. Moreover, the redemption option aligns the interests of junior creditors with those of shareholders in that they, too, would have an incentive for risk-shifting prior to bankruptcy. This, in turn, could increase the default risk of firms.====Our paper contributes to at least three strands of literature. First, it adds to the literature on bankruptcy design and its repercussions. A poorly designed bankruptcy procedure would prevent the optimal allocation of capital, ultimately turning into a drag on economic growth, and a threat to financial stability. Alternatively, an efficient reorganization process should allow distressed but viable firms to emerge sounder and continue to add value to the economy (Helwege and Zhang, 2016, Allen and Gu, 2018). For that reason, the current design of Chapter 11 and the debated reform proposals regularly attract the attention of law, economics and finance scholars (White, 1994, Dhillon et al., 2007, Kang et al., 2020, among many others). They also stand as a benchmark that other countries analyze for their own reforms (Tarantino, 2013). Our paper also contributes to the role of debt priority structure in managing risk incentives among claimholders (Black and Cox, 1976, Barclay and Smith, 1995). The bankruptcy law plays an important role in mitigating conflicts of interest among creditors with different degrees of priority (Bigus, 2002). We argue that granting an option-like payoff to junior creditors in financial distress has the unintended consequence of jeopardizing the management of agency conflicts as it was initially contracted in the capital structure. Finally, our paper contributes to the modelling of decision-making in bankruptcy negotiations (Annabi et al., 2012, Antill and Grenadier, 2019). Given that the Chapter 11 procedure entails collective bargaining, non-cooperative games seem appropriate to analyze claimants’ decisions. In addition, our modelling recognizes the non-passive role played by the bankruptcy judge.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the game-theoretic model of Annabi et al. (2012) and presents the modifications embodying the redemption option reform proposal. The solution of the negotiation game, with or without the reform, is detailed in Section 3.

The mainstream rationale for bans of state financing rests on the empirical assumption that monetary financing undermines fiscal discipline. We address the plausibility of this assumption by estimating local projection models for a panel of euro area countries to explore the reaction of the sovereigns’ fiscal position to a monetary policy shock. Our results suggest that fiscal discipline is not waning after an expansionary monetary policy innovation that can be related to non-standard policy interventions, as expressed through an improvement of the primary balance despite declining borrowing costs. While no compelling inferences can be made as to the driving force of this improvement – political pressure channeled through conditionality may be a plausible explanation – our results suggest that empirical claims on the adverse effect of unconventional monetary policy on fiscal discipline are ill-founded.","In general terms, monetary financing can be defined as running a fiscal deficit which is not financed by the issue of interest-bearing debt, but by an increase in the monetary base (Turner, 2015). With monetary financing a long time perceived to fall outside the mandate of modern central banking (Blyth and Lonergan, 2014), the laws governing monetary state financing vary significantly across jurisdictions. Under US law, there is no explicit prohibition of Federal Reserve monetary financing in congressional legislation or the US Constitution. Similarly, in the UK no prohibition on monetary financing is codified at national level. By contrast, Japan prohibits central bank financing of fiscal policy by ordinary law, and the European Union (EU) has even constitutional law in place stipulating a ban on monetary state financing. A heterogenous practice adds to this inconsistent legal governance of monetary financing. While historically there have been precedents in the US of monetary state financing, the Treasury has been barred from receiving direct funding from the Fed since the 80ies. In Japan, explicit allowances exist under the law for exceptions of monetary financing and the EU has experienced an episode of unconventional monetary policy including controversial purchases of government bonds throughout the sovereign debt crisis in recent years. Most recently, the Bank of England announced to directly finance the government's extra spending related to the Covid–19 pandemic.====Heterogeneity in both rules and rule application raises the question of economic plausibility of the ban on monetary state financing. The mainstream rationale of the ban refers to the adverse effects of monetary financing on fiscal discipline, with reliance on monetary sources for the purpose of fiscal stimulus undermining their incentive to pursue sound budgetary policy. This rationale is deeply rooted in economic literature with its anchor in the monetary policy literature that has extensively studied time-inconsistency problems in dynamic settings and potential solutions to it (Svensson, 1997, Walsh, 1995). This economic insight spurred legislation in many countries to make central banks independent from their governments. With independence becoming persistent practice, monetary financing was applied less commonly as governments lost grip on central banks to help them satisfy their fiscal preferences through monetary financing. The economic literature on the macroeconomic desirability of inflation conservative central banks (Rogoff, 1985) added to this insight by offering a rationale that monetary and fiscal policies should be pursued independently from each other. More recently, however, neat separation of fiscal and monetary independence has been put in question by the Covid-19 concerted actions of fiscal and monetary policies. To the extent that fiscal and monetary instruments have been made effectively through their complementarity, there is potential of coordination between central banks and treasuries (Bartsch et al., 2020).====Historical experiences with monetary policy as an instrument for public state financing vary. While monetary financing has been (and continues to be) in the arsenal of permissible tools of monetary policy by central banks in the US and UK, elsewhere it is viewed to contribute to lax fiscal policies. The latter is evidenced by the Japanese episodes of monetary financing (Saravelos et al., 2016), or in the EU, where it has more recently given raise to controversial debate and judicial litigation on the scope of monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB). At its core, the lawfulness of unconventional monetary policy measures during the European sovereign debt crisis has been assessed against the legal benchmark of the ban on monetary state financing under EU law. In line with the mainstream rationale, views in legal scholarship consider the primary goal of this ban in ensuring that Member States are held liable for their fiscal conduct through market pressure (Borger, 2016, Palmstorfer, 2012, Ruffert, 2011). Specifically, the ban on monetary financing has been interpreted to ensure that markets apply their assessment of creditworthiness and charge higher risk premiums if there are doubts about a country's fiscal behaviour (Borger, 2016, 4).====Based on the premise of central banks being independent from the fiscal desires by governments, the banning of monetary financing roots in the malincentives associated with monetary policy reacting to the financing needs by governments. Hence, a recurrent argument associated with the application of the ban on monetary financing is moral hazard concern infused by unconventional monetary policy measures, in particular by sovereign bond purchases, to the effect that they lower incentives to pursue balanced budgets.====The purpose of this paper is to review the legal interpretation that justifies the ban on monetary financing on the grounds of undermining fiscal discipline. We use Jordà's (2005) local projection method to examine the reaction of the sovereigns’ fiscal position to a monetary policy shock. We refer to a panel of ten euro area countries, which were affected by the ECB's unconventional monetary policy measures. Our results suggest that fiscal discipline is not waning after monetary policy innovations that can be related to non-standard interventions, as expressed through an improvement of the primary balance despite declining borrowing costs. Thus, we find no evidence in support of the claim on the adverse effect of unconventional monetary policy on fiscal discipline.====Our study is related to the work of Hachula et al. (2020) who investigate the side effects of the ECB's monetary policy on the euro area economy. They report that the government budget balance improves temporarily in response to expansionary monetary policy shocks that also reflect non-standard interventions. However, the effect of monetary policy shocks on fiscal discipline is not explicitly considered. Additionally, our analysis contributes to a strand of literature dealing with the relationship between countries’ fiscal position and market forces. Mauro et al. (2015), De Haan and Sturm (2000), Theofilakou and Stournaras (2012), de Groot et al. (2015), and Debrun and Kinda (2016), among others, document that fiscal policy is disciplined by market pressure, i.e. fiscal discipline is strengthened in times of high sovereign bond yields that give rise to the consolidation of government debt. Moreover, Tkačevs and Vilerts (2019) find that the fiscal balance deteriorates after borrowing cost decline. Our results are at odds with the findings of these studies to the extent, that we observe that fiscal discipline is maintained after monetary policy innovations that induce a decline in yields on sovereign bonds. While no compelling inferences can be made on the driving forces of our results, they may be a consequence of strong political pressure arising, for instance, from the wish to avoid the usage of rescue packages that are conditional on austerity measures. Thus, although monetary policy eased market pressure, and hence, should have weakened fiscal discipline, these measures were implemented at a time when other policies were put in place that replaced market pressure with political pressure.====Our analysis feeds into the discussion of sound legal governance of monetary financing in the various jurisdictions. It suggests that fiscal discipline is not a plausible ground to ban monetary financing as such. While unconventional monetary policy improves the macroeconomic environment by lowering borrowing cost, it does not systematically undermine fiscal discipline. This should be borne in mind when designing and interpreting legal rules on monetary financing.====The article is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the legal issues surrounding monetary state financing and explores the legal rationale for the ban on monetary financing.

Previous experiments have shown that giving participants the opportunity to select the organization that receives their tax funds tends to increase tax compliance. The aim of this paper is to assess whether this increase in compliance is induced by the sole fact of giving subjects a choice—a “direct democracy effect”. To that aim, we ask participants to a tax evasion game to choose, in a collective or individual choice setting, between two very similar organizations which provide the same social (ecological) benefits. We elicit compliance for both organizations before the choice is made so as to control for the counter-factual compliance decision. We find that democracy does not increase compliance, and even observe a slight negative effect—in particular for women. Our results confirm the existence of a commitment effect of democracy, leading to favor more the selected organization when it was actively chosen. The commitment effect of democracy is however not enough to overcome the decrease in the level of compliance. Thanks to response times data, we show that prior choice on similar options as compared to a purely random selection weakens the preference for honesty. One important field application of our results is that democracy in tax spending must offer real choices to tax payers to improve compliance.","It is now well-established that compliance with the law does not solely depend on the content of the law itself, but is shaped by the process leading to its implementation. According to a large strand of literature in behavioral law and economics, people tend to be more respectful of the same rules when they had a voice in their adoption as compared to when the rule is exogenously imposed on them. Such a direct democracy effect has been observed in a wide range of economically relevant situations like, ====, when people take part in setting goals for themselves (Locke and Latham, 2002); when farmers decide on irrigation rules (Bardhan, 2000), or when workers have a voice in organizing their work (Ichniowski et al., 1997).====Most of the existing experimental literature focuses on the effect of direct democracy on cooperative behavior in social dilemma, and confirms drastic increases in compliance when the rules are democratically chosen before they are implemented. The empirical identification of such a spillover of democracy on compliance behavior faces the obvious challenge of self-selection into the policy when the choice of the rules is endogenous. Dal Bó et al. (2010) are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to disentangle the selection effect and the endogenous effect of direct democracy in the context of fines imposed on deviations in a prisoner's dilemma game. They find a modest selection effect (8% of the overall observed change in behavior when fines are enforced democratically rather than exogenously) and confirm that direct democracy induces a large increase in cooperation: the effectiveness of fines is 40% larger when chosen endogenously.====In this paper, we empirically investigate the direct democracy effect on tax compliance of giving taxpayers a voice over the use of collected taxes. While this question has received less attention in the literature, a few existing studies, starting with Alm et al. (1993), tend to suggest that tax compliance is higher when expenditures are decided endogenously. This echoes recent trends in the policy sphere, where direct democracy becomes widespread as a tool to strengthen citizens commitment to the tax system.==== Such an application of direct democracy is however likely to elicit strong selection effects, as citizens are offered the choice of which public good they want to fund. The aim of our study is to measure the direct democracy effect of such a policy while taking into account the change in preference-driven compliance. Our analysis proceeds in three steps.====The first step of our study, presented in Section 2.1, is based on a new analysis of the individual data from previous experiments. The estimation results on pooled data show an at most weak effect of direct democracy on compliance. We then move to an original experiment (presented in Section 3) designed so as to disentangle the causal effect of direct democracy from self-selection. Our baseline extends the design of Jacquemet et al. (2020) experiment to tax compliance in favor of a randomly chosen organization. To account for preference-driven compliance, we purposefully chose two organizations that are as close as possible from the point of view of subjects’ preferences, we elicit compliance for both organizations before the organization is selected, and we elicit subjects’ preferences about the two organizations at the end of the baseline experiment. In our main treatment of interest, the organization is rather chosen by majority voting in groups of three subjects. The third step of our analysis builds on additional treatments aimed at clarifying the mechanisms that can possibly generate a direct democracy effect. First, we measure the effect of social coordination thanks to a variation of the vote treatment in which free-form communication is allowed between subjects before the voting stage. Second, at the other extreme, we eliminate the social context in a treatment in which the organization is chosen individually by subjects. Third, in all treatments, our design provides counter-factual observations of what compliance would have been would the non-selected organization had been selected. The resulting gap in compliance provides a measure of the commitment effect of direct democracy.====The results, described in Section 4, are threefold. First, we fail to replicate the increase in compliance previously observed when the use of collected taxes is decided by vote. We rather observe a decrease in the level of compliance for the preferred organization, which is mainly driven by female participants’ response to the treatment. Second, based on the gap in compliance, our results confirm a commitment effect of democracy: the gap in compliance in favor of the preferred organization is larger when it has been actively chosen. This change is however dominated by the negative direct democracy effect, resulting in a lower level of compliance when democracy is implemented. More precisely, the main effect of direct democracy in our data is to sharply increase the share of partial compliers, at the expense of a lower share of full compliers. Third, as compared to a simple vote, our results confirm a slight increase in compliance when subjects are able to coordinate before deciding on their preferred organization, but we do not find any difference in compliance between a vote and a single decision-making situation. We discuss the implications of our results and the open avenues for further research in Section 5.",Does voting on tax fund destination imply a direct democracy effect?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000272,27 June 2021,2021,Research Article,73.0

We model how (1) the chief ","In this article, we present a framework for understanding important aspects of Supreme Court decision-making that heretofore have been overlooked or underplayed in analyses of Supreme Court behavior. In particular, we focus on how the rules of opinion authorship for the Court, the utility the justices receive from authorship, and the legal doctrines presented in a case interact to produce strategic authorship opportunities for the justices and, occasionally, unexpected decision outcomes for the Court. Key to the framework is a fresh recognition of the legacy value the chief justice receives from authorship and the role that legal doctrines play in affecting authorship utility among the justices. Introducing the effects of legal doctrines and the authorship utility justices receive from writing opinions within those doctrinal frames helps to explain the voting and authorship behavior of the chief justice and other senior justices on the Court.====To highlight the insights of our approach, we compare our framework with a standard game theoretic model of Supreme Court decisionmaking based on strategic policy-seeking justices. This comparison shows how legal doctrine and authorship utility together alters the strategy of justices and the case outcomes that emerge. In particular, reputational utility from authorship, conditioned by the existing legal doctrines, shape the Court’s decision choices and the likelihood an important decision is authored by the chief justice or another senior justice on the Court. In many situations, our model’s predicted results would be different from the standard strategic voting model. Our model, for example, explains a nuanced game between the Court’s chief justice and a senior median justice and predicts not only the case outcome, but which justice will likely command a majority coalition and author the opinion. More generally, strategic justice voting is dimensionalized in our model beyond mere policy preferences and decision costs typical of models in other theories, adding new insights into other drivers of Supreme Court coalition formation and case outcomes.====We illustrate important aspects of our framework with a stylized presentation of ==== -- a case that challenged the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (popularly known as “Obamacare”). In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts for the first time joined with the Court’s four most liberal justices to form a 5−4 majority upholding the signature policy achievement of the Obama administration, with the Chief Justice himself authoring the majority opinion. The outcome was a surprise to most Court observers. We use our model to explain this unexpected outcome, focusing on (1) the Supreme Court’s rules of opinion authorship, (2) the reputational and legacy value of opinion authorship to the justices, especially the chief justice, and (3) the constraining or enabling nature of legal doctrines. An examination of this historic case through our framework illustrates the more general interaction between the Chief Justice and senior median justices over case outcomes and opinion authorship that goes well beyond the Obamacare case.",Authorial control of the Supreme Court: Chief Justice Roberts and the Obamacare surprise,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000259,16 June 2021,2021,Research Article,74.0

We use an extensive-form game to model decisions that must be made by insurers when their insured party has been injured and sues for damages. If the insurer decides to join the lawsuit, it must decide how much, if anything, it will contribute to the legal expenses of the plaintiff.====We find that that with perfect information and risk-neutral parties there is no loss of tort liability and deterrence: the parties’ actions under a subrogation regime will be identical to what they would have been without subrogation. These results are somewhat counterintuitive, and in some instances may have been contradicted by the actual decisions of insurers, but are quite consistent with one remarkable development: many health insurers now take the initiative to contact the plaintiff's lawyer to inform her that they will make a payment for her services.","Before about 1960 the only persons with a direct interest in the outcome of personal injury lawsuits in the U.S. were the plaintiffs, the defendants and their lawyers. However over the last 60 years personal injury litigation has been gradually transformed by the ever-increasing use of subrogation by plaintiffs’ insurance companies.====The doctrine of subrogation can best be explained by an example. Suppose X, whose health insurer is Y, is injured by a careless driver Z, and sues him for negligence. X obtains a recovery of $500,000, representing $300,000 in medical expenses that were previously paid by Y and $200,000 for her lost earnings. Subrogation enables her insurer Y to step into her shoes and recover its expenditure of $300,000 from the defendant Z who was primarily responsible, leaving X with only $200,000 in damages. Z is still liable for full damages of $500,000, but the insurer Y has taken $300,000 which the plaintiff would have recovered otherwise.==== Subrogation is “an equitable doctrine under which one who has paid a debt for which he is secondarily responsible [the insurer Y, who paid Z's involuntary debt to X in advance] takes over the creditor's [X's] rights and remedies against the party primarily responsible for that debt [Z].”====Subrogation has a long history, with its origin attributed variously to Roman civil law or Talmudic Law.==== In the U.S., subrogation has long been employed without controversy in the area of property casualty insurance.==== It was, however, not generally available to automobile and health insurance companies, because of the common law prohibitions against the assignment of personal injury claims, and the splitting of causes of action based on personal injuries.==== Beginning roughly in the 1960s, automobile and health insurers began to insert rights of subrogation against tortfeasors in their policies, and to press for the right of subrogation in State courts and legislatures.==== An argument often cited was that if the insurers had no right of subrogation, claimants would be unjustly enriched by a double recovery, from both the insurer and the tortfeasor. Here, in the absence of subrogation by Y, Ms. X would receive $300,000 + $500,000 = $800,000 for an injury that cost her $500,000, raising the issue of moral hazard.====When pursuing its subrogation interest, the insurer must decide how much, if anything, it will contribute to the legal expenses of the plaintiff – whether, for example, it will contribute its proportionate share of the expenses, equal to ==== in the above example. If it decides to contribute nothing, or less than its share, there is a short-term gain, but in the long run, other of its insured parties who are injured may conclude it is not worthwhile to sue, thereby depriving the insurer of subrogation opportunities. This incentive problem was recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 2013 case: “Without cost sharing, the insurer free rides on its beneficiary's efforts – taking the fruits while contributing nothing to the labor … [citing a federal case] ‘If … injured persons could not charge legal costs against recoveries, people like [the plaintiff] would in the future have every reason’ to make different judgments about bringing suit, ‘throwing on plans the burden and expense of collection”’==== . Moreover, a general decline in tort litigation could mean less deterrence and more careless behavior on the part of tortfeasors, resulting in an increase of claims made against the insurer. Our model deals with this conundrum.====There has been surprisingly little research by economists on the effects of subrogation on personal injury litigation. However Sykes (2001) and Polinsky and Shavell (2018) have evaluated different possible subrogation arrangements to determine which variation is an optimal contract, in the sense of maximizing the expected utility of a risk-averse consumer of insurance. Sykes, and Polinsky and Shavell, find that if insurance companies have no costs, the entire award from tort litigation should be retained by insurers; the insured party benefits through uniformly lower premiums and by avoiding the risk of litigation. Polinsky and Shavell, however, also find that if insurers have administrative costs, which of course they do, it is optimal for the insurer to pay some fraction of the award to the insured.",Subrogation and its consequences for tort litigation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000260,12 June 2021,2021,Research Article,75.0

We use constitutional adjudication at the Spanish Constitutional Court to test for this distinction. We consider all constitutional review decisions in cases initiated by explicit political actors (","The empirical literature on judicial behavior has expanded considerably in the last decade. The overall statistical results show that the different theories have some predictive power. Formal legal sources matter and judges do conform to precedent and legalist interpretations of the law on many occasions. Judicial preferences also play a role. Particularly, ideology has an important explanatory power when it comes to understanding constitutional review. However, ideology comes into play within a complex set of interactions between politics, social experiences, public opinion, judicial philosophies, and many other considerations that vary across jurisdictions. The attitudinal model finds empirical support in suggesting the important role of ideology (Segal and Cover, 1989; Epstein and Knight, 1998; Segal and Spaeth, 2002; Epstein et al., 2013). But the strategic model also deserves extensive consideration since courts seem to react to varying political and institutional realities (Gely and Spiller, 1990).====In a more recent article, Epstein and Posner (2016) make an important distinction between ideological alignment with a political party and personal loyalty to the presidential appointer. They study voting in the U.S. Supreme Court for the period 1937–2014 and find a loyalty effect- “justices more frequently vote for the government when the president who appointed them is in office than when subsequent presidents lead the government”, even when the “subsequent presidents are of the same party as the justices in question.”====The distinction between ideological proximity and personal loyalty in judicial review and judicial behavior, more generally, is worthy of empirical investigation. The consequences of personal loyalty rather than (or on top of) ideological agreement are also significant. Once the appointer is removed from office, judges are less likely to vote according to the appointing party’s specific interests, making their behavior less predictable from a pure attitudinal model. Adding the personal loyalty dimension teases out different judicial dynamics and improves the predictive power of the attitudinal model.====We use the Spanish Constitutional Court to test the model inspired by Epstein and Posner (2016) and consider the possibility that personal loyalty alongside ideological agreement could play an important role outside of the U.S. reality. There are a few institutional features that make the Spanish institution an interesting candidate for this empirical exercise. First, there is a reasonable empirical literature about this institution, thus making it easier to contextualize the distinction between party loyalty (already documented by previous quantitative studies) and party leader loyalty. Second, we observe strong party leaderships, direct involvement of political parties and their leaders (as prime ministers) in selecting constitutional judges and reasonably long judicial terms in the Court.====At the same time, there are profound differences in the political (presidential versus parliamentary regimes), party (Spain has standard European-style parties, that is, stable, and reasonably well-organized and disciplined political organizations, whereas the U.S. has two traditional loose political coalitions at both sides of the spectrum) and legal (Spain belongs to the Kelsenian tradition of centralized abstract constitutional review while the U.S. has a model of decentralized concrete review) dimensions. Therefore, there is a methodological challenge to assessing the distinction between ideology and personal loyalty beyond a specific U.S. context. Still, some of the relevant institutional characteristics of the Spanish Constitutional Court are common to many European countries and around the world, therefore making our empirical analysis a relevant starting point to think about features of constitutional courts that may be generalizable to a certain degree.====The Spanish party system has been dominated until very recently by two main political forces: PSOE (progressive/socialist) and PP (conservative). PSOE existed before the transition to democracy and, as we can see from Fig. 1, it has ruled Spain for long periods (1983–1996; 2004–2011; since June 2018). The party has been under strong leaders such as Felipe González (1974–1997) and José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero (2000–2012).====The main conservative force was, initially, a centrist coalition, UCD (====), under the leadership of the symbolic politician of the democratic transition, Adolfo Suárez. The coalition collapsed in 1982 and was disbanded in 1983. Soon thereafter, PP (under its original name, ====) emerged as the dominant party in the center-right. The party leaders have been Manuel Fraga (1976–1987 and 1989–1990), José María Aznar (1990–2004), Mariano Rajoy (2004–2018) and Pablo Casado (since 2018). The right, initially under UCD and later with PP, has ruled Spain for significant periods (1976–1982; 1996–2004; 2011–2018).====As we can easily infer from Fig. 1, party leaders who win general elections (and become prime ministers) tend to have long party leaderships (Felipe González and José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero on the left, José María Aznar and Mariano Rajoy on the right). They also tend to resign or go away when the party loses power (Felipe González in 1997, José María Aznar in 2004, José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero in 2012, Mariano Rajoy in 2018). Strong and powerful party leaderships are likely to enhance loyalty from those selected and appointed by the party to serve in different positions, including the Constitutional Court. It seems a viable context to test the model proposed by Epstein and Posner (2016) and investigate the likelihood that personal loyalty, not just ideological agreement, plays an important role in constitutional review.====Out of 63 constitutional judges in the period 1980–2018, nearly half (30 judges) were selected under one party leader and finished their term under a different party leader. As to votes by judges whose political party is no longer led by the appointing leader, there are 914 observations (slightly over 10 % of the entire population of judicial votes). These numbers reflect particularities related to some specific periods and party leaderships (for example, the collapse of UCD in 1982 or the long-term PP party leadership of Mariano Rajoy).====Our findings indicate that in the behavior of Spanish Constitutional judges there is evidence consistent with personal loyalty. Further analysis by nonunanimous decision, a subset of judges, and appointing bodies does not undermine these findings. Notwithstanding, we also detect that such effect is statistically stronger after 2012 in judges appointed by José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero, a period dominated by two major political and constitutional phenomena: the financial crisis, on the one hand, and the Catalan separatist clash, on the other. In both, although more markedly in the second, the role of the Constitutional Court and the consequences of its rulings were very politically relevant. One possible explanation is that party leaders have taken the role of the institution and the political relevance of its decisions and the appointments to the Court more seriously in this period, given the large political salience of the Court’s constitutional powers.====The paper goes as follows: The institutional context of the Spanish Court and the literature review are presented in section 2.

They are responsible for the conduct of monetary policy, and in several countries, they get involved in the supervision of the financial sector. We derive a simple theoretical model to illustrate how culture may influence a politician's choice of regulatory architecture and the assignment of responsibilities when anticipating the impact of that regime on the regulatory agencies’ incentives to cooperate. Using a sample of around 70 countries during the period 1996–2013 we confirm that the extent of supervisory duties that are allocated to the central bank are influenced by national culture. More specifically, consistent with the theoretical predictions, we find that individualism is positively associated, and ==== is negatively associated, with the likelihood of higher central bank involvement in supervision.","Central banks around the world have a special role in both the economy and the public administration domain, which usually is the outcome of a government act establishing the central bank as the government’s main bank. Additionally, the responsibilities that have been assigned to central banks over time provide them with structural power and freedom that few other public authorities and institutions have (Blinder, 2004; Dyson, 2009; McPhilemy and Moschella, 2019). Therefore, it is not surprising that central banking has received a lot of interest from various disciplines, like law (Zhou and Li, 2006; Masciandaro and Quintyn, 2009; Staikouras and Triantopoulos, 2016), economics (Kim and Kim, 2007; Bholat et al., 2019), political science (Masciandaro, 2007; Hayat and Farvaque, 2012), and public administration (McPhilemy and Moschella, 2019; Moschella and Pinto, 2019).====In recent years, one topic that has attracted the attention of scholars from almost all the above disciplines is the architecture of the financial supervisory system. This includes questions like whether there should be one or more regulatory agencies, how to allocate powers among different agencies, and whether and to what extent the central bank should be involved in supervision. The importance of these issues lies in the fact that the regulatory agencies are the ones that must design and implement the laws that govern the stability and efficiency of the financial sector.====In general, studies in this field fall into four broad categories. First, there are both law and economics studies that discuss theoretically the advantages and disadvantages of central bank involvement in the supervision of financial firms (Goodhart, 2000; Beck and Gros, 2012; Staikouras and Triantopoulos, 2016). Second, there are empirical studies that propose indices to quantify the extent of central bank involvement in supervision (Masciandaro, 2004; Masciandaro and Quintyn, 2009). Third, there are studies that examine the impact of central bank supervision on various outcomes like bank efficiency (Gaganis and Pasiouras, 2013), bank soundness (Doumpos et al., 2015), firms’ financial constraints (Mertzanis, 2020) and economic growth (Masciandaro et al., 2013). Fourth, there are studies that investigate the driving factors - i.e., the determinants - of central bank involvement in supervision (Masciandaro, 2006, 2009; Masciandaro and Romelli, 2018).====The present study falls into the last strand of the aforementioned literature. Previous studies have mainly focused on economic and formal institutional factors, like the country-level governance (i.e., regulatory quality, rule of law, etc.), legal origins, market capitalization, past banking crises, and banking sector size (Masciandaro, 2006, 2007, 2009; Masciandaro and Romelli, 2018). There is no doubt that these factors play an important role. However, we hypothesize that informal institutions, like deep-rooted cultural factors, also drive lawmakers’ decisions of whether (or not) to grant supervisory powers to the central bank.====The starting point for our analysis is Masciandaro (2009) who proposes a theoretical model that considers the politician’s objective function in determining the level of unification of the financial supervision regime. First, he assumes that the society assigns to an elected lawmaker the task of designing the institutional regime that guarantees the effectiveness of financial supervision. Then he shows that the decision to grant supervisory powers will depend upon the politician’s objective to maximize the difference between political gain and political cost of action. Within this context, we assert that this policymaker should consider the potential conflicts of interests and coordination issues when the supervisory arrangements bring together different authorities under a cooperative agreement, in contrast to a unified approach where one institution (Central Bank) has multiple mandates and the instruments to achieve them (Lombardi and Siklos, 2016). For example, the literature suggests that regulatory agencies with overlapping or conflicting mandates may engage in turf wars or bureaucratic stand-offs (Taylor, 2015) as well as that independent central banks may not welcome a coordinating policy (Lombardi and Siklos, 2016). Most importantly, Carmichael (2015) highlights that such difficulties in achieving cooperation and information sharing between regulatory agencies because of the inherently territorial human nature. Consequently, a lawmaker who wants to guarantee the effectiveness of the supervisory architecture will consider the expected human values and beliefs about cooperation that are embedded in one’s culture, as these should characterize the individuals in the different regulatory agencies, and subsequently the organizational culture of the agencies.====As we discuss in more detail in Section 2, in the present study we examine the role of two national culture dimensions that appear to be particularly relevant to our work. The first is the dimension of individualism versus collectivism, which relates to group cohesion and ties between individuals, and has apparent implications for conflict handling styles. The second is the dimension of power distance, which refers to the cultural attitude toward power inequalities amongst members of society. In Section 3, we present a simple theoretical model that shows how these two dimensions could shape the willingness of the authorities to cooperate and to avoid turf wars, with implications for the government’s final decision as for the allocation of supervisory power and the adoption of a certain supervisory architecture. We combine these cultural data with information on central bank involvement in supervision from Masciandaro and Romelli (2018) over the period 1996–2013, and we estimate an extended ordered probit model that accounts for the potential endogeneity of national culture with an instrumental variable approach (Wooldridge, 2010). Controlling for other country-level economic and political attributes proposed in the literature, we find that a national culture of individualism (power distance) is positively (negatively) associated with the decision to grant more supervisory responsibilities to the central bank.====The rest of the paper is as follows.

Before Ursula von der Leyen the new President of the European Commission, announced as a priority the issue of environment sustainability (European Green Deal), the European Parliament in February 2019 asked for an adaptation of competition policies to take into account issues of public interest such as environmental sustainability, corporate social responsibility and so on.==== The argument is that “competition law may be an obstacle to competition restraints that would nonetheless promote welfare, by ensuring more sustainable consumption and production for instance [...] When production involves a negative externality, such as a harmful by-product of output (e.g. pollution) or the decentralized use of a common resource, then a restraint of trade among competitors and the ensuing drop in output will necessarily limit the negative externality (see Cosnita-Langlais (2020) page 1)”. In this paper, we contribute to this debate, analyzing possible designs for environmental liability laws, considering how firms’ decisions are constrained by these alternative environmental liability laws, and finally discussing the consequences for (non-conventional) competition policies.====We consider the realistic situation where firms in an oligopoly produce a joint and indivisible environmental harm as the by-product of their output. Aside of expenditures in productive inputs and the precaution cost, the existence of environmental liability law compels firms to bear supplementary costs that reflect their liability burden. The characteristics of this liability cost for environmental harm reflect the specific design of the law: this latter may be described as the combination of a liability regime (negligence vs strict liability) that requires or not a targeted precautionary activity to avoid any liability burden, a damages apportionment rule (per capita vs market share rule) that defines the way total damages for harm done to the environment are allocated among responsible firms, and a damages multiplier (loosely speaking, punitive damages) that expands the effective damages paid above the observed value of the environmental damages suffered. Here however, we consider a basic competition policy focused on consumers surplus and the expansion of aggregate output on the market thanks to firms’ entry on the market.==== Our concern is twofold: On the one hand, do environmental liability laws give efficient incentives to firms for the protection of environment, or at least, is there a specific legal design that dominates the others according to the Social Welfare criterion? On the other hand, to what extent are environmental liability laws constraining competition policy, justifying non-conventional, more lenient actions with the purpose of increasing firms’ expenditures in environment preservation? The analytical framework we use to tackle these issues is based on a symmetric oligopoly ====, where firms produce a homogeneous good for a constant marginal cost. The cost of precautionary measures is modeled as a fixed cost with respect to production, and liability cost as a function of the expected environmental harm specific to the design of the liability law. The expected environmental harm is related both to expenditures in precaution and production, and increases with the industry output at a more-than-proportional rate. This “cumulative effect” (Daughety and Reinganum, 2014) is relevant in contexts where environmental harms are the result of non linear effects, i.e. responses more than proportional to the exposition to dangerous/toxic substances, and/or because harms can only be observed after lagtimes and long latency periods, once a serious environmental deterioration is achieved.====Regarding our first research question, we show that environmental liability laws generally fail in achieving efficient care expenditures. Firms follow suboptimal decision rules in the setting of precautionary measures as well as in the choice of output, and thus reach equilibrium levels that may be excessive as well as insufficient with regards to socially optimal ones. The introduction of optimal damages multipliers under strict liability allows firms to adopt efficient rules in care activity, but the outcome at equilibrium is nevertheless that care as well as output are lower than what is required with regard to Pareto efficiency. Under negligence (with a standard of care) firms face efficient incentives for care activities, but choose excessive levels of output and care. The main implication of this part of the paper is that environmental liability laws, alone, cannot attain the social optimum in a context where care and output decisions are interrelated.====With regards to our second research question, we analyze how the specific design of environmental liability laws is constraining the objective of competition policy. A law based on strict liability associated with the per capita rule, and an optimal damages multiplier, has an appealing feature for a Competition Authority. In implementing the law, Court actions do not impinge on its domain: a standard/conservative competition policy will succeed in increasing consumer surplus thanks to the expansion of aggregate output, and this will be accompanied by an increase in aggregate care expenditures. Moreover, such a policy is welfare improving, and should market structure be closer to perfect competition then the equilibrium would coincide with the social optimum. In contrast, we show that an environmental liability law based on the market share rule under strict liability, or negligence with a standard of care, does not verify this property. Such designs translate to firms a structure of liability cost that develops anti-competitive effects, as this cost increases with the number of firms on the market. Thus, firms’ entry may lead to a cut in individual output and care decisions large enough to produce a decrease of the aggregate output and care levels, despite more firms compete on the market. Nonetheless, Social Welfare under such laws is maximized for a finite number of firms; in contrast, as the market structure becomes closer to perfect competition, the aggregate care and output levels fall short of their optimal values. In all, strict liability with the per capita rule and optimal damages multipliers appears as an “ideal” environmental liability law, a kind of first best design, and is consistent with a standard competition policy dedicated to the improvement of competition on the market. This ideal policy mix requires no specific coordination between Courts and the Competition Authority. In turn, alternative designs for environmental liability law put stronger constraints on firms as well as a Competition Authority, that may justify non-conventional competition policies, limiting firms’ entry, as a kind of second best solution. However, to reach the fine tuning of such orientation, a Competition Authority needs specific information on Courts’ behavior as well as care technologies. To sum up, the key point for a Competition Authority is the knowledge of the impact of liability law on firms production costs, since this cost depends on the liability regime as well as the sharing rule of damages between firms.====The former results are obtained under the implicit assumption that firms make positive profits at equilibrium. In this perspective we also show that under the market share rule firms make a higher profit than under the per capita rule (for any given number of firms, and the optimal damages multiplier). This means that regarding the issue of firms’ entry, both rules exert different private incentives on firms, that may potentially translate into rule specific consequences at the long run equilibrium: the zero profit condition is met with more firms on the market under the market share rule than under the per capita rule. However, we show that in such a long run equilibrium the aggregate output, the aggregate care expenditures as well as the level of Social Welfare obtained under the per capita rule are always larger than under the market share rule.====Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 introduces the model and solves the social optimum. Section 4 analyzes the equilibrium of the industry under Cournot competition, when strict liability is associated with either the ==== or the ==== rule. We study whether the combination of a damages multiplier and firms’ entry have the potential to recover the social optimum. Section 5 considers the implications of a shift from strict liability to the negligence rule. Section 6 affords some robustness checks, and discuss the implications for competition policy. Section 7 concludes.",Should environment be a concern for competition policy when firms face environmental liability?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000144,3 May 2021,2021,Research Article,78.0

This article conducts ==== to examine the impacts of the regulation of a common defensive tactic in China that requires shareholders to hold shares for a certain period before they can nominate directors (“the holding-period requirement”). The Chinese Securities Investors Service Center (CSISC), which is a quasi-government organization under the charge of the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, initiated regulatory actions against this type of defensive tactic claiming that it violates mandatory rules in Chinese corporate law, which caused on average a -0.31% abnormal return to stocks of over two hundred corporations that had adopted similar tactics. The impact of the first event on the sample stocks was statistically significant, suggesting that the defensive tactics were beneficial to firm value and the regulatory decisions had negative impacts on firm value. Corporations with similar defensive tactics also experienced a -0.25% abnormal return on average after the court ruled that this type of defensive tactic violated Chinese corporate law. Evidence suggests that the events had a larger impact on corporations with dispersed ownership structures and small market capitalization. These results suggest that employing mandatory rules to regulate the holding-period requirements in China is likely to harm shareholders’ interests.","Scholars have long debated whether defensive tactics benefit shareholders and how to regulate them. While some scholars point out that these tactics tend to increase agency costs and reduce the number of hostile takeovers, others argue that they may enhance competition for the control of the corporation, raise the premiums that shareholders of target corporations can receive, and also maintain the stability of the operation of the corporation (Coffee, 1984, p.1175; Easterbrook and Fischel, 1981, p. 1169; Strine, 2006, p.1764; Lipton, 1979, p.104; Cremers and Sepe, 2016, p.83; Bebchuk et al., 2002, 2009). Hostile takeovers play an important role in the Anglo-American corporate governance system (Armour and Skeel, 2006). Given the difference in ownership structure and market activities, the same takeover regulation that is appropriate in the United States or the United Kingdom may become “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” when it is transplanted to civil law jurisdictions because it may allow controlling shareholders to use defensive tactics as a “deceptive disguise” to entrench themselves in the corporation (Ventoruzzo, 2008). Similar concerns also arise in China, where the anti-takeover law is in its incipient stage of development.====One approach to regulate defensive tactics would be through mandatory rules in corporate law. Scholars have noted that, rather than allow shareholders complete autonomy in deciding the rules of internal governance, certain rules in corporate law are mandatory. Jeffrey Gordon famously proposed the “opportunistic amendment hypothesis,” suggesting that corporations may amend charters in the midstream, which harms the interests of minority shareholders and enhances the controlling positions of the board of directors or the controlling shareholders (Gordon, 1989). However, the adoption of many defensive tactics can be considered midstream changes that enhance the power of corporate insiders at the expense of outsiders. Many defensive tactics are still considered valid by most developed states (Romano, 1989; Catan and Kahan, 2016). Whether mandatory rules should be employed to regulate defensive tactics remains an important issue.====In China, one of the most common types of defensive tactics is the holding-period requirement. If a listed corporation has adopted the holding-period requirement, a shareholder can only nominate directors after it holds the shares for a certain time period. This arrangement is similar to the “time-phased voting” arrangement in the United States in the sense that both of them give more control to the shareholder who holds the shares for a longer time period. The “time-phased voting” arrangement has been gaining influence in recent years though it still remains under-studied (Dallas and Barry, 2015).====This article examines the impact of mandatory rules on the holding-period requirement in China with event studies. The China Securities Investor Services Center (CSISC), a nonprofit corporation under the charge of the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), sent a letter on April 18, 2017 to a listed corporation, Shanghai Hile Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (Hile Bio-Tech), requesting it to amend its corporate charter to delete a defensive tactic that requires a shareholder to hold the shares for 90 days before it can exercise its right of nominating a director. The CSISC believed that such a provision violated mandatory rules in Chinese corporate law, while Hile Bio-Tech insisted that the provision was valid. CSISC then sued Hile Bio-Tech on June 26, 2017, requesting the court to declare certain defensive tactics void. On April 28, 2018, the Fengxian People’s Court of Shanghai ruled that this type of corporate charter was void for violating mandatory rules in Chinese corporate law.====This article employs two event studies to analyze the effects of the holding-period requirements. The first event date is set at April 18, 2017, which was when the CSISC issued the letter to Hile Bio-Tech. The shareholder letter may be viewed as a signal that the CSISC would take regulatory actions against other corporations with similar defensive tactics. The second event occurred when the court declared this type of defensive tactic to be in violation of the mandatory rules in corporate law on April 28, 2018.====The empirical results show that the CSISC’s action on April 18, 2017 caused a -0.31% abnormal return on average to corporations with similar defensive tactics. The abnormal return is statistically significant and negative, which indicates that investors in the capital market believed that employing mandatory rules to regulate these defensive tactics would harm the interests of shareholders. Corporations that had adopted similar provisions also experienced, on average, an abnormal return of -0.25% to their stocks on the date that the court declared these provisions void. These results suggest that at least some of the holding-period requirements currently adopted by Chinese firms likely increase firm value, while China’s current regulatory approach may be detrimental to shareholders’ interests.====I also examined firm-level factors that may have affected the impacts of the events. Evidence suggests that the events had a stronger impact on corporations with dispersed ownership structures. In addition, corporations with a smaller market capitalization were also more significantly affected by the events. The empirical findings of this article contribute to the literature on defensive tactics and have important policy implications in China and elsewhere.",Does regulation of defensive tactics with mandatory rules benefit shareholders?

Yet despite the agreement among policymakers, court administrators and scholars about the pressing nature of the problem====, we are aware of no systematic quantitative study characterizing the impact of the pandemic on the output and performance of the courts of law.====In this paper, we provide the first full-fledged empirical inquiry into the effect of the Covid19 pandemic on the success of courts at performing their primary function, the resolution of disputes and disposition of cases. To this end, we draw on comprehensive data on the activity of labor courts in Brazil. In Brazil, the impact of the pandemic has been especially severe.==== At the same time, the court system as a whole, and labor courts in particular, have been subject to a series of pandemic-instigated policy responses that have fundamentally affected their operations. Brazilian labor courts possess jurisdiction over all labor law-related disputes, with the overarching majority of filed claims pertaining to infringements of employee-employer agreements, especially with regard to unlawful termination of employment and unpaid compensation. As such, labor courts constitute a crucial component of the Brazilian judicial system. Moreover, empirical insight into the effect of the pandemic on the administration of Brazilian labor justice provides valuable clues about the effects of the pandemic on the courts of law in other jurisdictions worldwide.====The assessment of the consequences of the pandemic, however, presents an empirical challenge. A naïve pre- versus post-pandemic comparison of court outcomes, for example, will not adequately capture the effect of the pandemic when court activity is subject to inherent temporal trends. We therefore adopt a difference-in-difference (DD) approach. To construct the missing counterfactuals depicting the changes in the labor court outcomes in the absence of the pandemic, we rely on the changes in the outcomes of the same set of courts observed during the pre-Covid19 epoch. That is, prior to March―the month of the onset of the pandemic in the year 2020―the trends in the outcomes in the Brazilian regional labor courts during the Covid19 epoch, defined as the 12-month span from November 2019 to October 2020 (the latest month of data availability), closely resemble those registered one year earlier. This feature renders the same set of regional labor courts that we observe also during the pre-Covid19 epoch, defined as the 12-month span from November 2018 to October 2019, a suitable control group for purposes of our analysis.====Our DD estimates show that the Covid19 pandemic, above all, drastically adversely affected the adjudicative efficacy of Brazilian labor courts. We find that the pandemic-caused average drop in the monthly clearance rate in adjudication is of the size of about one-fifth of the mean monthly clearance rate during the pre-pandemic era. Consequently, the pandemic led to a surge in court backlogs in adjudication, with the estimated increase in the number of pending cases per judge equal to about a quarter of the mean monthly pending cases per judge recorded during the pre-pandemic era. Thus, the pandemic is expected to exert a lasting deleterious effect on the ability of the courts to deliver justice in due time.====At the same time, the pandemic has impacted the modes with which the courts dispose adjudication cases. As one would have expected, the share of adjudication cases disposed via trial hearings decreased sharply as the courts implemented an initial ban on all in-person court activities. The pandemic, however, has at least on average not affected the share of adjudication cases disposed via in-court settlement or lawsuit withdrawal. Interestingly, we also do not find evidence of an impact of the pandemic on court outcomes in enforcement. Neither the clearance rate in enforcement nor the volume of pending enforcement cases per judge exhibit a detectable change as a result of the pandemic. Similarly, even though the pandemic resulted in an increase in the relative demand for judicial enforcement versus adjudication, we do not find evidence that the pandemic altered the relative reliance on judicial enforcement as means of securing the execution of court-sanctioned payments among the disputing parties. As we emphasize in interpreting our results, this last finding is an especially important and, in many respects, a reassuring one. At least during our observation window, the pandemic has on average not increased the need for judicial enforcement that could have conceivably arisen amidst the pandemic-instigated economic downturn, a period when the losing parties pressed for cash may be tempted to purposely avoid the execution of court-ordered damage and compensation payments.====In addition to offering the baseline DD estimates of the average effect of the pandemic, we provide two further sets of estimates. We first explore an event-study approach to provide insight into the month-by-month effect of the pandemic. The response of the Brazilian labor courts to the pandemic has evolved with the evolution of the pandemic itself. Intuitively, one would therefore expect that the effects of the pandemic on court outcomes varied over time. As we demonstrate, the estimates based on a dynamic specification indeed reveal important insights into the temporal effects of the pandemic that would remain hidden if one focused solely on the static DD estimates. Our analysis shows, for example, that the negative effects on the clearance rate in adjudication were largest in the first few months after the start of the pandemic, but gradually diminished in magnitude as time unfolded and the courts implemented various response measures. Similarly, while the static DD estimates do not show an effect of the pandemic on the share of in-court settlements, the estimates based on the dynamic specification uncover that the initial effect on the share of in-court settlements was, in fact, negative, while the effect several months into the pandemic turned to positive. We interpret these findings in light of the existing theories of litigation.====Finally, we investigate the heterogeneity of the effect of the pandemic with respect to the intensity of the pandemic. Since its onset, the Covid19 pandemic has in Brazil exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation with regard to its severity, with different regions adopting different response measures at different points in time. The specificities of local conditions at a given point in time plausibly influenced the functioning of the courts in that locality at that point in time. To measure the intensity of the pandemic, we utilize official Brazilian monthly regional data on new Covid19 infections and Covid19-related deaths. We then estimate a specification where the DD effect of the pandemic is allowed to vary with pandemic intensity. Our findings suggest that the effect of the pandemic on court outcomes exhibits important heterogeneity with respect to pandemic intensity. We find, for instance, that the adverse effect of the pandemic on adjudicatory efficacy has been larger for those labor court region-months that have exhibited stronger pandemic intensity. Similarly, the average effect of the pandemic on the share of in-court settlements is positive in the labor court region-months characterized by a higher incidence of new infections or a greater virus death toll. But we once more do not find evidence of an effect of the pandemic on the core judicial enforcement outcomes.====Our paper adds to and links two primary strands of literature. On the one hand, we contribute to the emerging literature on the consequences of the Covid19 pandemic for the courts of law. The Covid19 crisis has stimulated a global policy and academic debate about the numerous ways in which the pandemic has already affected, and will likely still affect, the operations of courts and the delivery of justice (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The existing contributions on the topic, however, have been primarily descriptive in character. In particular, the research has not illuminated the impact of the pandemic on the administration of justice using comprehensive court data and rigorous quantitative analysis. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to accomplish this task.====At the same time, we contribute to the growing empirical literature on the administration of justice and the functioning of courts. Motivated by the ubiquity of court delays and the corresponding social costs incurred by numerous jurisdictions worldwide, an important subset of this literature has focused on the determinants of the efficacy of courts at performing their core role, the disposition of cases (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). A related subset of research has investigated court-level factors affecting the use of different modes of court case disposition (e.g., ====; ====). In contrast, judicial enforcement of final verdicts, a distinct and often especially vital facet of court activity, has received much less attention (====; ====). Our paper advances the corresponding literature by empirically examining the impact of the Covid19 pandemic on all three of the above-noted aspects of court output and operations.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

First, we construct, on the basis of the applicable legal provisions, a set of novel indicators measuring whether and to what extent each occupation is regulated. We then provide a long-run descriptive assessment of the extent of regulated occupations, showing that the share of workers involved has steadily increased over time reaching about one fourth in 2018 (more than one half among workers with a college degree). Finally, we show that these occupations are characterised by lower mobility and by a significant wage premium (particularly for the most highly regulated ones).","The study of the regulation of occupations has a long and distinguished tradition in economics, dating back to the days of Adam Smith.==== Originally motivated by concerns over public health and safety, the extent of regulation has significantly increased over time. The still scant evidence suggests that as of today about 29% of US workers and 22% of EU ones are employed in regulated occupations (Kleiner and Krueger, 2013, Koumenta and Pagliero, 2019).====Despite the magnitude of the phenomenon and its large potential impact on employment, competition and quality of services provided, the extent and effects of occupational regulation are still under investigated in the economics literature (Kleiner, 2000, Gittleman et al., 2018).==== The present paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon with three main objectives. First, we build a set of novel indicators that measure, for each occupation, whether it is regulated or not (i.e., extensive margin), the year from which it has been regulated, and the type and extent of regulation (i.e., intensive margin). Second, we provide a long-run descriptive assessment of the extent of regulated occupations in Italy and of the characteristics of the workers involved. Third, we examine the impact of regulation on the labour market, analysing, in particular, the effects on occupational mobility and on wages over the period 2004–2018.====According to our indicators, in Italy there are nearly 150 regulated occupations, as defined on the basis of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). About 50% of these occupations have been regulated before 1950. In terms of employment, in 2018 about 5.5 million individuals are estimated to have worked in regulated occupations in 2018, corresponding to 24% of overall employment (53% among those with a college degree). The corresponding figures for the ==== – i.e., a subset of regulated occupations that are subject to stricter entry requirements and restrictions on market conduct – are, respectively, 10% and 31%. Moreover, we find that employment in regulated occupations has increased steadily over time, raising by over 30% from the first half of the 1990s.====We further show that occupational mobility is considerably lower in regulated compared to non-regulated occupations both in terms of job-to-job mobility and of non-employment-to-job mobility.==== Our estimates suggest that over half of the raw gap in mobility is due to regulation while the rest is explained by compositional differences. Regulation mostly affects job-to-job mobility and, to a lesser extent, entry from (exit to) a status of non-employment. As far as the different dimensions of regulation are concerned, entry into regulated occupations is mostly restrained by the length of education and training requirements. We also find a large wage premium for incumbents in regulated occupations that amounts to about 9% (nearly 18% in ====). Interestingly, the wage premium is larger for the lower quantiles of the individual wage distribution. Moreover, it is significantly larger for women and lower for younger workers who face more difficulties in challenging the advantage of more established incumbents. The wage premium is mostly driven by the length of education and training requirements and by restrictions on market conduct (e.g., on prices, advertising, etc.).====We contribute to the literature in several ways. First, licensed occupations are usually examined only on the extensive margin, i.e., whether a specific occupation is regulated or not. In this paper, instead, we also measure the extent of regulation under several different dimensions, thus showing that the intensive margin matters as well. Second, the existing evidence usually adopts a (static) cross-sectional perspective, whereas we examine licensed occupations in a longitudinal dimension, providing an assessment of their long-run evolution. Third, we provide a more comprehensive analysis of labour market effects of regulation, by looking not only at wages but also at labour market fluidity defined as cross-occupation mobility. Finally, we fully exploit the richness of the data at our disposal to provide a comprehensive description of all licensed occupations, whereas previous studies either focused on a single profession or analysed the regulated professions as a whole, without distinguishing the peculiarities of each occupation.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we provide an overview of the existing literature on regulated occupations; in Section 3 we describe the Italian institutional setting and its policy evolution; in Section 4 we introduce the data and the variables used; in Section 5 we provide some descriptive statistics of the phenomenon; in Section 6 we study the impact of regulation on job mobility and wages; and in Section 7 we draw some concluding remarks.",Regulated occupations in Italy: Extent and labour market effects,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818821000119,13 March 2021,2021,Research Article,81.0

Consistent with existing empirical studies, our model optimally yields three payment methods: Full cash, full equity, and a mix of cash and equity. The optimal level of cash in the transaction stems from the interplay between the magnitude of leverage deficit of one or both firms and the scale of synergies, in particular financial, that can be reaped from the acquisition. Finally, we emphasize the key role played by the capital structure of the target firm.","The choice of payment means in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) is diverse. Eckbo et al. (2018) and de Bodt et al. (2018) report that the annual fraction of full cash and full stock deals amounts to 70% in period 2000–2014, whereas the remaining 30% of transactions are mixed offers of both cash and equity. Yet, existing theories largely focus on full-cash or full-stock payment and do not predict mixed payment as an optimal outcome.==== The only exceptions are Eckbo et al. (1990) and de La Bruslerie (2012), who show that mixed offers can be optimal under double-sided information asymmetry.====Inspired by the empirical studies that document a link between the method of payment and the firm's leverage prior to acquisitions (Karampatsas et al., 2014, Harford et al., 2009, Uysal, 2011), we build upon a standard trade-off model of capital structure to characterize the conditions for each type of payment – full cash, full stock, and mixed – to be optimal. The central mechanism of our model is that acquisition is an opportunity for both firms to rebalance the capital structure of the combined entity.==== This rebalancing process determines the optimal cash-equity mix. Indeed, the acquiring firm issues debt to pay cash to acquire the target firm as long as tax benefits outweigh bankruptcy costs.==== This optimal amount of cash then depends on the leverage deficits of both the acquirer and the target as well as on the synergies stemming from the acquisition. The acquirer relies on issued equity when the level of cash is not enough to fully pay the target.====Specifically, we first show that the existence of operational synergies may be a second-order concern to complete the deal when the acquirer is underlevered prior to the acquisition. In this case, the acquirer can raise debt to the point where the combined firm is optimally levered for cash payment, and full cash is feasible when the acquirer is deeply underlevered. Consistent with DeAngelo et al. (2011), this result explains why firms remain underlevered, as it allows them to pay in cash when facing future investment opportunities through acquisitions.====Second, when the acquirer is overlevered, we show that firms combine to realize financial synergies, which originate from lowered default probabilities and hence incremental net tax benefits (Leland, 2007). In this case, the fraction of equity in the payment is high, and full equity becomes optimal when the acquirer is heavily levered. Faccio and Masulis (2005) find that financially constrained bidders choose stock-financed deals more frequently. Harford et al. (2009) show that the acquiring firm is unlikely to issue new debt and pay with cash if its leverage is above its target level. Bruyland et al. (2019) document that high default risk acquirers rely on shares to pay for their transactions. We show, however, that using stocks may deter the acquiring firm from completing the deal to avoid loss of corporate control.====Third, while the existing empirical literature focuses solely on the capital structure of the acquirer to explain the method of payments in acquisition (for instance, Harford et al., 2009, Uysal, 2011), we emphasize that the capital structure of the target should also play a key role. Indeed, the leverage deficit of the target firm affects the equity price before the transaction as well as the level of total synergies that can be reaped from the acquisition. This result is consistent with the findings of Almeida et al. (2011) and Erel et al. (2015).====Fourth, the optimal cash-equity mix depends notably on the magnitude of the leverage deficit before the acquisition. This result corroborates the empirical evidence in Uysal (2011), who documents that overlevered firms have 5.1% less cash in their offers, while the effect of underleverage on the percentage of cash is the opposite. We show that the proportion of cash is substantial when the acquirer is underlevered and the target is financially distressed due to overleverage.====Finally, we show, under the liquidity default, that the correlation between the two firms is an important determinant of the optimal mix. Firms that belong to negatively correlated industries are likely to use more cash as a means of payment for the transaction. This is due to the additional debt capacity that stems from a reduction in the overall risk because of the negative correlation. However, the effect of correlation on the optimal fraction of cash is mixed, when we consider an optimal default boundary.====Our analysis complements the work of de La Bruslerie (2012). He builds upon a contractual approach and double-sided asymmetry to derive an optimal cash-equity mix. He excludes, however, any financial constraints on the grounds that they lead to a “corner solution for full-cash (full-debt) financing”, if raising cash through debt is limited.==== Our study also relates to Agliardi et al. (2016), who rely on a trade-off model to study M&A activities. They do not, however, focus on the payment method.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

I analyze a model in which initially the defendant has complete information about the case whereas the plaintiff knows nothing but can learn any fraction of the information, at no cost to himself, through discovery, after which the defendant can disclose any fraction of the remaining information at a constant marginal cost. The plaintiff may underutilize discovery so as to have a chance of privately identifying the defendant's type while still outwardly maintaining his belief that the defendant may have a weak case. For a defendant with a strong case, incomplete discovery can make it excessively costly to signal his strength through a high level of disclosure and excessively risky to signal his strength through a low settlement offer. I show that, in that situation, the availability of discovery actually decreases the probability of settlement.","The standard explanation for why settlement talks sometimes break down, despite the fact that both parties know that there will be additional legal fees if the case goes to court, is asymmetric information. The natural follow-up question is: “why aren’t the procedures of discovery and disclosure sufficient to resolve it beforehand?” Indeed, the idea is often advanced that one of the most important purposes of discovery is to facilitate settlement (Huang, 2009). There is little cost to the party that utilizes the rules of discovery to force the other side to reveal its information, so it is not clear why a party would not discover as much as possible. But in reality, they usually do not (Brazil, 1980, Shepherd, 1999). For example, in Brazil's (1980) survey of lawyers, 155 out of 176 said that they had at least once decided not to pursue information through discovery for tactical reasons. When the 155 were asked in what fraction of cases that occurred, the mean response was 25%.====The idea that I put forward here is that the plaintiff may undertake positive but incomplete discovery to improve his chances of responding optimally to the defendant's settlement offer while still outwardly maintaining his belief that the defendant might have a weak case and thereby affect the defendant's settlement offer. It is well known, in settings in which there is either zero or complete discovery, that whichever of the two that the party responding to the settlement offer chooses, the party making the offer demands the entire expected surplus, and therefore if discovery is at all costly, it will not be utilized (Farmer and Pecorino, 2005). The main contribution of the present paper is to investigate the setting in which discovery allows for the party responding to the offer to learn any fraction of the available information and, importantly, the amount of information needed for him to (privately) assess the merit of this particular case is initially unknown by both parties. In this setting, it turns out that the responder (here, the plaintiff) can sometimes capture some of the expected surplus. For some parameterizations, he can choose the maximum level of discovery that still induces the defendant types to pool on a middling settlement offer, and if he happens to privately become informed that the defendant is a weak type, then he will be able to reject the offer and go to court. In contrast, if there were no discovery available to the plaintiff, then the defendant types would pool on a middling offer and the plaintiff would always accept.====The reason that disclosure may be underutilized is simpler – the defendant, rather than the plaintiff, decides how much to disclose, so he will internalize the positive marginal cost. In the disclosure stage, the defendant types will either pool on zero disclosure or they will separate, with the weak type providing zero disclosure and the strong type providing the least-cost separating level of disclosure. Because separation in the disclosure stage would lead to separation in the settlement stage, the plaintiff can only capture some of the expected surplus if he induces pooling in the disclosure stage by keeping the least-cost separating level sufficiently high. In order to do so, he might have to undertake even less discovery than he would if there were no disclosure stage. In fact, if the cost of complete discovery is less than or equal to the total cost of going to court, then the plaintiff will be forced to undertake less discovery than he otherwise would. Under that assumption, when the availability of discovery decreases the probability of settlement, the availability of disclosure increases the probability of settlement despite the fact that it is not utilized in equilibrium.====With divisible information and the plaintiff's evaluation of the merits of the case realized privately, as the initial asymmetric information of the model disappears, a new one arises: the defendant does not know whether or not the plaintiff has become informed. To the extent he thinks the plaintiff is informed by the settlement stage, a defendant with a strong (weak) case has an incentive to capitalize on (concede to) that fact and make a low (high) offer, and by doing so may signal his type, purely through how confidently he bargains, to a completely uninformed plaintiff. This force for separation is completely distinct from the standard one that the defendant types have different outside options (i.e. expected payoffs at court). Similarly, in the disclosure stage, to the extent that a defendant with a weak case thinks the plaintiff will be informed by the start of the settlement stage, he has an incentive to concede to that fact and not pay excessive disclosure costs. Notice that, for both stages, the fact that the plaintiff has stayed uninformed is what makes him need to infer the strength of the case, and at the same time the fact that he could be informed is what makes the inference work. The final step back is to the discovery stage in which, for some parameterizations, the plaintiff will ensure that the defendant types pool in both the disclosure stage and the settlement stage, which keeps the settlement offer at a middling level.====There are a few papers with results that contrast the ones in Farmer and Pecorino (2005) that an uninformed offeror will do complete discovery if the cost is small and, more relevant to the present paper, that an uninformed responder will do zero discovery if there is any cost.==== In Farmer and Pecorino (2013), the uninformed offeror may prefer no discovery to complete discovery even if it is costless, because the former allows him to credibly maintain the threat to spend a large amount of money to win the case in court. In Lee and Bernhardt (2016), in the extension in which successful discovery reduces court costs, an uninformed responder may prefer positive but incomplete discovery, because there is a tradeoff between improving his outside option and paying the direct cost of discovery. However, in their paper, the level of discovery is exogenous. In Farmer and Pecorino, 2017a, Farmer and Pecorino, 2017b, an uninformed responder (for example, the defendant) may prefer costly, complete discovery to no discovery, because he may be able to achieve an expected utility greater than that from going to court even when the information asymmetry is resolved before the offer is made. The reason is that the defendant experiences a utility cost if he accepts an offer that he considers “unfair,” so the lowest acceptable offer may be one that he considers “fair” and provides him with some of the expected surplus.====In Mnookin and Wilson (1998) and Lee and Bernhardt (2016), the information that is available to be discovered is divisible. In fact, in the latter one, an increase in the amount of information obtained through discovery increases the probability that the plaintiff becomes informed, which is how discovery is modeled in the present paper. Two major differences between those papers and this one, however, are that here (a) the realization of the process of discovery is private information, and (b) an uninformed responder to a take-it-or-leave-it offer endogenously undertakes positive but incomplete discovery. There are two papers with assumptions that are in line with the one in this paper that the plaintiff's evaluation of the case is his private information. Hay (1995) assumes that, apart from the evidence about the case, a party's effort to prepare their case is private and could affect the outcome at trial. He writes “The [work product] rule normally spares a party [====] from questions by her opponent concerning her assessment of the evidence.” Chopard et al. (2010) differentiate their model of litigation with the assumption that the parties have private, unequal endowments in terms of skill or ability to predict the outcome at trial. Further, they argue that the results in Osborne (1999) “suggest that the focus be shifted to some neglected aspects of the discovery process, such as the difference in parties’ skill or ability to produce pieces of information used at trial.”====A more general contribution of this paper is to study the signaling games that arise in bilateral bargaining environments when, from the sender's point of view, there is a possibility that the receiver is informed. In Judd and Riordan (1994), the most relevant paper from the price-as-a-signal-of-quality literature, each consumer views the firm's price as a signal of how much he values their product but also draws on his personal experience with the product.==== In Cotton, 2009, Cotton, 2016, a politician views the size of each lobbyist's bid for access as a signal of the strength of their case but also draws on the information presented to him by the lobbyist who actually wins. In Barbos (2013), an evaluator views which tier the agent applied to as a signal of the project's quality but also draws on his own evaluation. Feltovich et al. (2002) augment Spence's (1973) game by giving the receiver an exogenous additional signal.====Finally, this paper contributes to the literature on bilateral contracts with information acquisition (Sobel, 1993, Lewis and Sappington, 1993, Shavell, 1994, Cremer and Khalil, 1994, Cremer, 1995, Kessler, 1998, Nosal, 2006, Dang, 2008, Kaya, 2010, Lester et al., 2012). These papers do not address the situation where the party that makes the offer is informed and the party that responds is uninformed but can acquire private information before the contract is offered. This situation generates a different kind of information acquisition problem where the initial acquisition decision can affect the informational content of the offer.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I present the model. In Section 3, I solve for and discuss the unique (modified) undefeated perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the model.

Yahagi Ken,"Faculty of Political Science and Economics, Waseda University, 1-6-1, Nishiwaseda, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 169-8050, Japan","Received 3 July 2020, Revised 11 January 2021, Accepted 21 January 2021, Available online 10 February 2021, Version of Record 16 February 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.irle.2021.105982,Cited by (4),"This paper provides a law enforcement framework through which to consider principal-agent relations among citizens, an elected official, and a law enforcer. This paper investigates how citizens’ interests are reflected in political competitions in terms of the use of financial incentives, e.g., the allocation of fine revenues, to control the intrinsically motivated law enforcer. This paper points out the limitation of using financial incentives to fully internalize society members’ interest in the enforcer's behavior from a normative perspective. Even if appropriate financial incentives are available, these cannot be chosen under political competitions.","Several agents participate in the modern law enforcement process, which involves principal-agent relations. First, local/state governments are agents for citizens and must take into account and pander to citizens’ interests under the voting processes. This is one of the main features of the modern democratic society.====Second, law enforcement authorities are agents for elected governments and are responsible for detection, apprehension, and conviction activities. Additionally, law enforcement authorities respond to several incentives. Some extrinsic (monetary) incentives are institutionalized. Law enforcement institutions are permitted to retain all or part of the gains obtained from enforcement that should be used for general funds and public services for citizens.==== For example, forfeiture laws in the United States allow law enforcement authorities to keep some of the seized cash and property, which can then be used for general funds (Edgeworth, 2008, Holcomb et al., 2011).==== The tax collection reform adopted in Brazil allows tax officials to retain some of the total fines and tax revenues collected from tax evaders (Kahn et al., 2001). Saskatchewan in Canada provides financial incentives for authorities when engaging in traffic safety enforcement (Harvey, 2020).====Law enforcement authorities also respond to intrinsic (non-monetary) motivations. This involves pro-social and punitive preferences regarding engaging in public services or punishing wrongdoers (Prendergast, 2007, Besley and Ghatak, 2005, Besley and Ghatak, 2008, Besley and Ghatak, 2018, Dharmapala et al., 2016, Friebel et al., 2019, Dickinson et al., 2015), professionalism (White, 1959), personal preferences regarding characteristics such as gender or race (Donohue and Levitt, 2001, Dedman and Latour, 2003, Makowsky and Stratmann, 2009, Makowsky et al., 2019), and so on.====Based on these motivations, we propose a formal framework to explore how these economic actors interact under their principal-agent relations and discuss the welfare implications. We introduce an enforcer that engages in detection, apprehension, and conviction activities and has only intrinsic motivations for their performances and lacks concern for the seriousness of offenses. Under this relation, we consider that citizens can give the enforcer financial incentives, i.e., some proportion of the fine revenues that should be used for citizens’ welfare-enhancing general public services, to reflect their interests toward the enforcer's action. In this respect, we focus on rewarding financial incentives as long as the enforcer achieves better performances; additional financial incentives (i.e., fine revenues) may be applied to the rent.==== However, when there exist conflicts of interests among citizens, i.e., those who violate the law and law-abiding citizens, this financial incentive is determined in the political competition. This framework incorporates some important aspects of Garoupa and Klerman (2002), who investigate fine revenue maximizing enforcers, and Langlais and Obidzinski (2017), who investigate democratic enforcement policy making process.====First, this paper investigates distortions caused by political competition under the influence of the motivated and independent enforcer by comparing politically chosen financial incentives with the socially optimal level. If the harms are too large (major offenses) or too small (minor offenses), then there exists no distortion. In the case of major offenses, political equilibria allow all of the fine revenues to go to the enforcer's rent because most citizens will demand strict enforcement. In this case, social welfare also requires severe enforcement in order to reduce harms; this political outcome is socially optimal. In the case of minor offenses, citizens do not allow the enforcer to have financial incentives in political competition because most citizens will commit an offense and require lax enforcement. In this case, social welfare also requires lax enforcement to take into account offenders’ welfare; this political outcome is socially optimal. However, if the harms are not too large or too small (intermediate offenses), then political competition promotes distorted financial incentives because the majority of citizens’ preferences are different from the social welfare maximizer's goals. For small offenses for which the harms are not negligible but are still rather limited, those who commit an offense become the majority and prefer lower financial incentives because paying the fines is welfare reducing for them, which causes under enforcement. For large offenses that inflict greater external harms, although most citizens will not commit such an offense, whether they demand higher financial incentives depends on the intrinsic motivation of the enforcer. If the enforcer has more/less intrinsic motivation, then the proposed financial incentive will be lower/higher than the optimal level. In our setting, if the enforcer is more intrinsically motivated, although this enforcer does not care about social harm, this enforcer will actively engage in the duty and provide more fine revenues for citizens. Then, law-abiding citizens tend to care about keeping the fine revenues rather than harm reduction, and they are then likely to propose lower financial incentives, which causes under-punishment. On the other hand, in the case of the less intrinsic motivated enforcer, law-abiding citizens will propose higher incentives to extract more efforts without considering the above trade off, which leads to over-punishment.====Since the above results are concerned with the distortions caused by citizens’ preferences in the political competition, we need to extend these discussions to consider the effects of the intrinsic motivated enforcer. Then, we compare the above outcome under the influence of the independent enforcer with the use of the financial incentive and the most efficient outcome that maximizes the sum of every economic actors utility without their principal-agent relations This approach also addresses the problem of whether only fine revenue allocation overcomes the self-interested actions of the motivated enforcer, which may indicate the limitations of the use of rewarding financial incentives. In case of major offenses, the presence of the motivated enforcer who lacks concern for the seriousness of offenses will cause under-punishment because providing only financial incentives is not enough to fully internalize social harms in the enforcer's costly action. In the case of minor offenses, the presence of the motivated enforcer will cause over-punishment because the enforcer actively engages in the duty based on intrinsic motivations, which thus makes it difficult to internalize the welfare of those who violate the law by only rewarding incentives. However, in the case of intermediate offenses, although optimal financial incentives that maximize social efficiency are available eve if there exists motivated enforcers, as the previous results indicated, political outcomes promote deviations from choosing the optimal financial incentive rules.====These results address the limitation of the use of fine revenues as financial incentives to fully internalize society members interests from social welfare perspectives.==== At the same time, the introduction of inefficient financial incentives emerges as a consequence of political competition, depending on conditions such as the seriousness of negative externalities, the distribution of illegal benefits, and each jurisdiction's characteristic features, as well as the presence of the intrinsic motivation of the enforcers. This might be helpful for understanding how different attitudes toward financial incentives among jurisdictions emerge.==== Our paper provides a framework different from that of Friehe and Miceli (2017) that accounts for the regional differences in crime rates.====Some studies have examined the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Benabou and Tirole (2011) consider a signaling model to investigate how the presence of reputational concerns influences optimal monetary incentives.==== Adriani and Sonderegger (2019) extend Benabou and Tirole (2011) and investigate how the characteristics of one's peers, which might depend on the quality of the belonging group, affect the incentives to engage in costly signaling.==== In contrast to these previous analyses, we focus on a specific setting in the law enforcement process, i.e., agents’ behaviors that deter offenses, to enhance public safety and financial incentives, which can be endogenously determined by the enforcer's performance and citizens’ preferences.====Regarding the effects of the presence of intrinsic motivations on legal processes, Mazyaki and van der Weele (2019), by extending the model of Benabou and Tirole (2011), explore how deterrent effects of both monetary and esteem-based incentives can reinforce one another, and they show how this causes multiple equilibria. Mungan (2016) also investigates the interaction among criminal stigmatization, reputational losses, and legal sanctions and shows that although an increase in formal sanctions can reduce stigmatization or reputation loss, this reduction cannot outweigh the increased deterrence caused by raising the formal sanction. Regarding the effects of intrinsic motivation on law enforcers behavior, Ash and MacLeod (2015) show, theoretically and empirically, that state Supreme Court judges are intrinsically motivated to provide high-quality decisions and, at the margin, they prefer quality over quantity; this suggests the presence of crowding effects between intrinsic and extrinsic incentives.==== Dharmapala et al. (2016) also consider the presence of punitively motivated law enforcers and show that punitively motivated individuals will self-select into law enforcement jobs that offer the opportunity to punish but with a lower salary. ==== We employ different approaches and extend these previous analysis with the use of extrinsic incentives, which can be chosen under democratic voting process.====In contrast to the optimal law enforcement theory, e.g., Garoupa (1997a) and Polinsky and Shavell (2000), there are studies that adopt the rent-seeking approach, in which the government does not always pursue social welfare enhancement.==== In particular, this paper follows the important arguments provided by Garoupa and Klerman (2002) and Langlais and Obidzinski (2017). We extend Garoupa and Klerman (2010) by noting how fine revenues should be used to control motivated enforcers and how fine revenue-motivated enforcers can be endogenously emerged under political competition. Additionally, in contrast to Langlais and Obidzinski (2017) and related papers, e.g., Mungan (2017) and Obidzinski (2019), we introduce office-motivated politicians and intrinsically motivated enforcers.==== The main difference is that even if those who do not commit an offense are the majority, this does not always lead to over-enforcement. This is because, in our setting, citizens may have an incentive to propose lower financial incentives to keep the revenues provided by more intrinsic motivated enforcers in exchange for giving up harm reduction, which indicates that less severe punishment can be consistent with those law-abiding citizens’ interests. Furthermore, our paper points out that it is not always possible to fully internalize society members’ interest in independent enforcers action under the democratic voting process.====Although this paper focuses on only rewarding incentives to control enforcers, there are some studies that employ the use of sticks. Friehe and Mungan (2020) consider how liability payment enforcers must pay in case of a wrongful stop that does not result in a conviction, which can be chosen under the democratic voting process. They show that the liability level that results in a voting equilibrium is smaller than optimal, which indicates that excessive policing practices emerge in equilibrium. Mungan (2020) employs rewards for accurate searches and liabilities for inaccurate searches to affect enforcers’ behavior and shows that when enforcers’ incentives can be altered via these extrinsic incentives, taste-based discrimination and statistical discrimination reduce deterrence.====This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, basic law enforcement models such as those from Garoupa (1997a) and Polinsky and Shavell (2000) are extended by incorporating some features of motivated agents. Then, we introduce the modified political competition model based on Langlais and Obidzinski (2017) to consider a fine revenue as an extrinsic motivation to control intrinsically motivated enforcers. Section 3 analyzes the political equilibrium and discusses the findings from a normative viewpoints in terms of distortion caused by voting process and the presence of motivated enforcers.

A “==== effect” prevails: the chance to reorganize after filing for bankruptcy varies with the composition of the chambers. We also confirm the existence of a limited (but not marginal) appointment bias, suggesting that bankruptcy cases are not fully randomized across judges. Several variables accounting for the judges’ profiles are found to be significant. The presence of female judges increases the chances of a successful plan (for continuation). We find a similar influence of the judges’ managerial skills and of the highest academic profiles. However, a mismatch between the judges’ profiles (mostly oriented toward big businesses) and bankrupt firms (closer to small and medium-sized enterprises) undermines the probability of reorganizing. We also focus on the two main filters for reorganization: ==== the decision to open an observation period, and ==== the court supervision of such a period. Our findings provide normative recommendations to better align lay justice with litigants’ needs. The results from France can be extended to other mixed bankruptcy systems.","The literature on corporate bankruptcy has extensively explored the features (costs, duration, and recovery) of reorganization versus liquidation (Bris et al., 2006; LoPucki and Doherty, 2004). In that vein, several studies have also surveyed the determinants of both outcomes. Among them, the design of bankruptcy procedures has been thoroughly scrutinized, especially regarding how creditors’ rights are protected after bankruptcy filing (Baird, 1986; Franks et al., 1996; La Porta and Lopez-de-Silanes, 2001; Brouwer, 2006; Stef, 2017). Other scholars have analyzed the influence of debt enforcement (Wihlborg et al., 2001; Wang, 2012) and of judicial efficiency of Russia’s regional courts (Lambert-Mogiliansky et al., 2007) on the chance to reorganize. Notwithstanding, these studies mostly rely on macroeconomic indicators to measure the “quality of justice,” which excludes a microeconomic examination of individual bias.====Few studies have investigated judges’ role – as individuals - in the bankruptcy process, and even fewer have relied on actual rulings. Rachlinski et al. (2006) examined behavioral bias among U.S. bankruptcy judges, but the data used for that research originate from experimental questionnaires that may be subject to declaration bias. A recent study (Iverson et al., 2019) addresses this question more directly by examining the accumulated experiences of U.S. judges in their bankruptcy districts. In this work, the judges’ characteristics are outlined by seven individual variables.==== Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, research on Europe is even more scarce, especially studies on how lay justice performs regarding corporate bankruptcy. Lazega et al. (2006) analyzed the network structures among commercial judges in France, but the authors did not relate these judges to the cases/disputes they supervised. Probing this latter issue is of utmost importance in the context of lay justice. Indeed, the heterogeneity of profiles between commercial judges is more pronounced than that between professional judges. Hence, one might suspect that a firm’s chance to reorganize also depends on the profile of the judge that supervises it.====The spirit of lay justice stems from the early ==== era, following the principle that conflicts between merchants should be solved by merchants themselves (Jean, 2007). Today, several European countries have converged toward a balanced system (====) whereby the bankruptcy chambers are composed of professional and non-professional judges (the latter also being called lay or commercial judges). Mixed bankruptcy chambers notably prevail in Belgium and Germany (Sénat, 1998). In France however, the commercial courts charged with bankruptcy cases are exclusively made up of commercial judges,==== which is an extreme application of lay Justice. Thus, France appears as a notable exception in Europe regarding the arbitration of commercial conflicts and the way corporate bankruptcies are supervised (Legendre, 2013).====Lay justice has several pros and cons that observers have delved into quite extensively (Diesen, 2001; Ipsos MORI, 2011; UJCB, 2016). On the one hand, professional judges have better knowledge of legal issues and of the “spirit of the law,” which makes their decisions better rooted in jurisprudence. Their common academic background makes them more homogenous, which is an additional guarantee of equal treatment for litigants. Further, professional judges can also be considered outsiders with a minimized risk of collusion with the cases they oversee. Last, the legal system does not have to invest in substantial training programs to familiarize them with legal concepts and procedures. On the other hand, commercial judges benefit from better knowledge of the practices within the business community. One might view them as insiders. ====, this should make them more reactive to changes altering the economy. The level of technicity in complex cases may also justify their (partial or complete) presence on panels of judges. However, such proximity with the business community can create conflicts of interest and collusion that might undermine the overall quality of judicial services.====This paper does not aim to question the advantages and disadvantages of the French system against alternative ones. Rather, we determine to what extent supervision from commercial judges (with heterogeneous résumés) influences firms’ chances of survival after filing for bankruptcy. We refer to this as the “==== effect.” A CV effect (if any) means that the chance of reorganizing does not depend exclusively on financial, economic, or social considerations, but also on subjective factors that reflect judges’ individual characteristics. Such factors are expected to vary from one judge to another, which calls into question Aristotle’s principle of fair justice (Renoux, 1993). Nevertheless, from a normative perspective, the identification of CV-variables influencing (positively or not) the likelihood of reorganization is of utmost importance for research. Namely, it helps identify pragmatic measures to improve the effectiveness of non-professional bankruptcy systems. Practically, this can take the form of training programs targeted at lay judges to reinforce their skills. Such investigation may also provide additional arguments to address the gender imbalance within the courts.====Our contribution is two-fold. First, we inspect a mechanism that has hardly been addressed by the literature on corporate bankruptcy—the link between judges’ profiles and the consequences of their decisions on the ultimate outcomes of bankruptcy. Second, unlike previous empirical works based on experiments or interviews, our data ====directly account for judges’ real decisions, and ====use genuine résumés, which eliminates the risk of biased responses.====The original data used for this research originate from the Paris Commercial Court (====). We hand-collected data from 230 bankruptcy files opened between 2006 and 2012 (terminated in 2019). A second data collection phase applied to 134 judges working for that court in the same time period. We used publicly available information to reconstruct their CVs. The merging of both datasets helps relate bankrupt firms with the panel of judges charged with their supervision. We run logistic regressions to scrutinize the influence of the judges’ profiles on the probability of reorganization (versus liquidation). We estimate five models, including two robustness checks. For all regressions, we confirm the existence of a CV effect.====The paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 introduces commercial justice in France. Section 3 presents our data, the sample structure, and provides a set of descriptive statistics. Section 4 tests for the existence of appointment bias that may alter the distribution of bankruptcy cases among the judges. Section 5 proposes regression analysis to link the judges’ profiles with the probability of reorganization. Sections 6 and 7 refine the analysis by focusing on two successive filters for reorganization.

In this context, we investigate how the fact that the choice whether or not to commit an harmful act is framed as a decision under ambiguity can modify the standard Beckerian results regarding the optimal fine and the optimal resources that should be invested in detection and conviction.","In the public law enforcement framework ==== Becker (1968), individuals are assumed to perfectly assess the probability of being fined if they commit an offense. However, in real life situations, potential offenders generally only have a vague idea of their own probability of getting caught and possibly, convicted. They have beliefs regarding the probability of detection and may exhibit optimism or pessimism. For instance, in the context of tax compliance, taxpayers tend to overestimate the probability of facing an investigation by the tax authority (Alm et al., 1992, Andreoni et al., 1998). In other situations, people are somewhat optimistic about their chances of not meeting with misfortune such as a car accident or illness (Jolls, 1998).====In our context, the way individuals estimate the probability of being detected will affect their decision whether or not to obey the law. This probability of detection and conviction is ambiguous while potential offenders know full well the amount of the sanction. The main justification for this hypothesis is that sanctions are often detailed in sentencing guidelines or penal codes, while information about the probability of detection cannot be given. Furthermore, uncertainty over the size of sanctions raises issues regarding the principle of equality before the law (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, article 7). Imagine Mr. A and Mr. B commit the same crime under the same circumstances. If Mr. A is sentenced to 5 years while Mr. B is sentenced to 3 years, the difference seems quite unfair.====Most theoretical contributions based on the standard public law enforcement model (Polinsky and Shavell, 2007) assume that the probability of detection and conviction is known by potential offenders. The aim of our paper is to investigate how ambiguity regarding this probability can modify the classical results regarding the optimal fine and the resources a benevolent public law enforcer should invest in detection and conviction.==== Ambiguity, as defined by Snow (2010), is uncertainty about probability, created by missing information that is relevant and could be known. There exists several alternative models of choice under ambiguity (Etner et al., 2012). In this contribution, we adopt the Choquet expected utility framework and we represent the potential offender's beliefs on the probability of detection with a neoadditive capacity. Our framework is closed to Chateauneuf et al.'s (2007).====We consider successively two different objective functions for the authorities, denoted the ==== and the ==== social welfare functions. These headings refer to Salanié and Treich (2009). They distinguish the ==== regulator who “maximizes social welfare computed with citizens’ beliefs” from the ==== regulator who “maximizes social welfare computed with the regulator's own belief”.==== Whether a regulator should adopt one approach or the other is subject to a debate in public economics (Pollak, 1998, Viscusi, 2000, Salanié and Treich, 2009, Johansson-Stenman, 2008).==== In particular, Johansson-Stenman (2008) supports that the regulator should take into account the discrepancy between the perceived and the objective risk as “the perceived risk affects individual utility directly”. This argument is in favor of the “populist” social welfare function. The author also refers to Becker and Rubinstein (2004) analysis of terror, where fear is inserted in the utility function. On the contrary, one reason to favor the paternalist approach is that the law enforcer may not observe these costs (such as the dis-utility of fear), or that what matters for society is what citizens are actually paying and not what they subjectively expect to pay.====In our public law enforcement setting, we look at the two social welfare functions (populist and paternalist), and we derive, in each case, the optimal enforcement policy.==== The key difference between the two approaches is whether the discrepancy between the objective and the perceived probability of fine should be taken into account by the law enforcer. Indeed, this discrepancy might generate a perception bias cost (gain) when individuals are pessimistic (optimistic). A paternalistic public law enforcer does not take into account the discrepancy between the expected and the actual expected fine, while the populist law enforcer does.====Our results call for the degree of pessimism of potential offenders in determining deterrence policy to be taken into account. Indeed, recommendations on deterrence policy can be widely affected by beliefs. Assume that individuals are pessimistic: they overestimate the probability of detection and conviction. We find that optimal fines may be lower for two reasons. First, fines may be considered as costly transfers if society takes mental suffering into account. Second, the subjective probability of detection is higher than the objective probability. Regarding the optimal means to invest in detection, our results go in different directions depending on the objective function of the law enforcer. When the law enforcer is populist (he/she takes into account the perception cost), we show that it may be socially desirable to raise the probability and to lower the magnitude of fine accordingly (in order to keep the deterrence level constant) if the marginal cost of detection is sufficiently small. In such a case, the fine is not necessarily maximal. When the law enforcer is paternalistic (he/she ignores the perception cost), the optimal fine is always maximal (as fines are costless transfers). And it is possible that the means invested in detection are lower than those in the absence of ambiguity only under certain conditions. In such a case, the objective probability of detection appears to be a less efficient deterrence tool due to the weight of the beliefs.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related literature. In Section 3, we present the model of public enforcement of law under ambiguity. In Section 4, we study the optimal fine. In Section 5, both the monetary sanction and the probability of detection and conviction are endogenous.

Due to the ==== nature of appointments, it has been suggested that arbitrators may strategically render decisions in biased ways with the goal of encouraging reappointments. Although criticism against arbitrator bias has attracted significant attention, so far limited empirical evidence has been provided to support such concerns. This paper introduces a dynamic perspective to examine concerns of bias arising from ==== appointment. I find that contrary to conventional views held by critics of investor-state arbitration, on average, arbitrators tend to decide against their reputation from prior decisions in ICSID arbitration, which implies an effort to establish a reputation for being neutral and unbiased. This finding challenges one of the premises of proposals to replace arbitration with an investment court.","Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) has become a focal point of backlash and controversy over the past few years. At the center of this controversy is the power of ==== arbitral tribunals to decide on matters of public interest that fall within sovereign states’ regulatory space. Investor-state arbitration is fashioned on the model of commercial arbitration which resolves mundane commercial disputes between private parties. However, unlike commercial arbitration, investor-state arbitration resolves disputes brought by foreign investors against sovereign states, and gives arbitrators the power to rule against government regulations in key areas such as health, environment and public welfare. The public function of investor-state arbitration thus sets high expectations for the impartiality and independence of arbitrators, who are subject to increasing scrutiny and criticism in recent years.====Investor-state disputes are usually resolved by a three-member arbitral tribunal, with one arbitrator appointed by each party, and a third presiding arbitrator appointed by mutual agreement between the parties. It is often argued that arbitrators, as ==== appointees, may be incentivized to vote in biased ways that enhance their career and financial prospects (Olivet and Eberhardt, 2012, Sornarajah, 1997). For example, as investor-state arbitration can be initiated only by investors, arbitrators may favor claimant investors over respondent states to enhance the attractiveness of investor-state arbitration to potential claimants and increase reappointments as the total number of cases grows (Van Harten et al., 2007, Ly et al., 2005). Other ISDS critiques focus on the lack of impartiality and independence of party-appointed arbitrators (Slaoui, 2009, Paulsson, 1997). These arbitrators are considered likely to favor their appointing party out of gratitude or self interests to generate more future appointments (Derains, 2012, Branson, 2010, Paulsson, 1997, Rogers, 2013).====In part due to such concerns, voices favoring ISDS reform have grown more pronounced. In 2017, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) gave one of its working groups the mandate to identify concerns about ISDS and investigate possible reform of the ISDS system.==== Among the working group's top priorities are issues of arbitrator bias and the effects of an ==== appointment process.==== Many countries registered concerns over perceptions of the existence of pro-investor and pro-state arbitrators, which they tied to the ==== nature of ISDS (Roberts, 2018). An enthusiastic advocate for the creation of an investment court with tenured judges, the European Union has included in its recent trade agreements provisions to establish a multilateral investment court, members of which will be appointed exclusively by states and paid a monthly retainer fee.==== Investment court proponents have argued that tenured judges, free from incentives related to possible reappointments, would be more impartial and independent compared to arbitrators appointed ==== (Van Harten, 2010, Van Harten, 2008, Sornarajah, 2008, Potesta and Kaufmann-Kohler, 2016, Larsson et al., 2019).====While the investment court proposal has generated a lot of attention and theoretical discussion, so far there has been limited empirical evidence in support of a primary concern behind the proposal: arbitrators are biased due to ==== appointment, i.e. the appointment of adjudicators for individual cases by the disputing parties. Investment court proponents attempt to improve adjudicator impartiality and independence by completely removing ==== appointment, which has long been considered a main attraction of international arbitration vis-à-vis national courts or other forms of dispute resolution (Waibel, 2016).==== Before embracing such a systematic reform of the ISDS system, we need to first understand the extent to which bias arising from ==== appointment exists.====In this paper, I focus on bias that may derive from the ==== nature of arbitrator appointment in ISDS. Because arbitrators are appointed for individual cases, they may try to develop a certain type of reputation in order to generate more reappointments from an appointing entity that prefers that type of reputation. For instance, investors might be more likely to appoint arbitrators with pro-investor reputations, and arbitrators hoping to obtain more reappointments from investors might thereby strategically vote in an attempt to shape a pro-investor reputation. Similarly, states might be more likely to appoint arbitrators with pro-state reputations, and arbitrators hoping to capitalize on this might strategically vote in a way that strengthens a pro-state reputation. On the other hand, the disputing parties may be more likely to agree on a presiding arbitrator with a neutral reputation. Thus, arbitrators more interested in becoming tribunal president might strategically vote in a way that strengthens a neutral reputation. This type of bias, which derives from arbitrators’ reappointment interests, is more specific to arbitration (in so far as judges are not selected by parties) and thus particularly important to considerations of reforming investor-state arbitration to more resemble a judiciary.====In this paper, I empirically examine whether arbitrators vote in biased ways due to reappointment incentives, and if so, in which direction their reputations develop on average. I compiled a data set of arbitrator votes and appointments from all publicly available arbitration cases registered with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) before January 1, 2016. I focus on ICSID arbitration cases because ICSID is the major forum to resolve investor-state disputes. In addition, different from other arbitration institutions, ICSID publishes most of the arbitral awards it administers, and provides detailed arbitrator appointment information in each case.====Using the ICSID data set, I first explore whether different appointing entities possess specific reputation preferences. An arbitrator's previous decisions and awards are known to be one of the most important factors that appointing entities look at when making appointment decisions.==== Based on their previous voting patterns, I construct measurement of arbitrators’ reputations and find that whereas investors or states are more likely to appoint arbitrators with stronger reputations for being pro-investor or pro-state, respectively, entities with the authority to appoint presiding arbitrators are more likely to appoint those with stronger reputation for being neutral.====Next I investigate whether on average, arbitrators are establishing a specific type of reputation over time due to reappointment incentives. To examine this question, I look at the relationship between an arbitrator's reputation from prior decisions and their subsequent voting behavior. I find that as an arbitrator's reputation for being pro-investor becomes stronger, she will be more likely to vote in favor of states in the next case. On the other hand, as an arbitrator's reputation for being pro-state becomes stronger, she will be more likely to vote in favor of investors in the next case. This finding suggests that arbitrators may try to establish a reputation for being neutral and unbiased in ICSID arbitration by avoiding a series of decisions that might seem biased against one side.====Distinguished from previous studies that have focused on static (i.e. time-invariant) arbitrator bias (Kapeliuk, 2010, Kapeliuk, 2012, Franck, 2009), this paper considers a dynamic approach towards arbitrator behavior. Examining how arbitrators behave in response to different appointment incentives in ICSID arbitration helps us evaluate concerns about arbitrator bias associated with ==== appointment and related reform proposals. This paper also adds to earlier literature which considered incentives from investor or state appointments only, by also considering incentives arising from other entities with authority to make appointments.====Methodologically, this paper develops new empirical strategies to measure arbitrator reputation on a time-variant basis. The paper also introduces a placebo test that addresses the false positive risk in estimating dynamic effects. Relying on an original data set, this paper documents informative patterns in arbitrators’ appointment and voting behavior. Normatively, this paper proposes that dynamic bias deserves greater attention when evaluating the institutional design of investor-state dispute settlement. The fact that reappointment incentives may have resulted in arbitrators making incorrect decisions so as to dispel any suspicion of bias reveals a potentially problematic aspect of ==== appointment that nonetheless is different from the type of bias suspected by most ISDS critiques.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Part 2 provides a brief overview of ICSID arbitration and related literature; Part 3 presents a theoretical account of possible strategic behavior arbitrators may develop in the face of different reappointment incentives and uses this theory to generate testable hypotheses. Part 4 introduces the data set that I compiled for this project. Part 5 reports the empirical results, and Part 6 provides concluding remarks.",Are arbitrators biased in ICSID arbitration?

Private creditors, which had massively invested in LICs (especially in Africa), have been so far relatively spared. But would they keep lending to these countries if a new wave of debt write-offs were to occur? Building on the two largest debt relief programs for LICs, namely the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), we investigate whether debt relief leads international private creditors to withdraw or to resume lending to beneficiary governments. Using a difference-in-differences approach, our results suggest that debt relief has fostered borrowing from private creditors, and identify the absence of reputational effects and the short-term horizon of private creditors as the key drivers that made renewed access to the credit market possible.","Over the past few years, various reports from the Bretton-Woods institutions (BWIs) have stressed the worrying evolution of public indebtedness in low-income countries (LICs) (IMF, 2017, IMF, 2018, World Bank, 2020). One reason for this is the paradoxical change in LIC financing. Because of the administrative burden and limitations of traditional IMF-WB style concessional finance, some LICs have turned to the international financial markets, where they face much higher interest rates and shorter loan duration. In addition, the recent pandemic is painting an even gloomier picture of the situation, with most scholars and experts agreeing that the Covid-19 crisis is likely to worsen public finance and to raise current public indebtedness to unsustainable levels, especially for LICs. These various threats have thus revived debates about the need for a new debt relief scheme. Yet despite improvements in domestic resource mobilization, developing countries need, more than never, external financing in order to ensure a sustainable development path.====It may therefore be legitimately asked how new debt write-offs would impact beneficiary countries’ borrowing capacity, especially toward private lenders. It is this question that the present study addresses, adopting a historical perspective focused on developments in borrowing from external investors in the aftermath of the two largest debt relief programs for LICs. Many low-income countries have indeed been granted debt relief by bilateral creditors and international financial institutions under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiatives since 1996, and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) since 2005. Have these initiatives led international private creditors to change their perception of beneficiary countries, either reinforcing their risk-aversion or prompting them to resume lending? This paper sets out to answer this question with an empirical assessment of debt relief's impact on external private financing and identifies the circumstances under which this might have happened. In other words, our study aims to appraise whether debt relief “irresistibly attracts banks as honey attracts bees” (as initially formulated by Dornbush with respect to the sovereign risk)==== or, conversely, deters them from providing further financing. These questions are particularly timely and important in light of the recent debates regarding a possible (or inevitable) HIPC III in a near future.====Historically, Rawling's Ghana refused HIPC debt relief in the first place, because of fears of subsequent increases in interest rates (although it was the only African HIPC country to do so). The same concern lay behind the refusal of Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India to have their debt rescheduled following the 2004 tsunamis. Yet can the increase in borrowing costs and the narrowing of financing opportunities be deemed rational following debt cancellation? In actual fact, debt relief probably sends a mixed signal.====On the one hand, debt relief would not be expected to build investor's confidence because countries unable to repay their debt in the past could be seen as risky borrowers, leaving private creditors exposed to the risk of sovereign default and with little legal coverage in the event of a new debt relief scheme. Indeed, under the Enhanced HIPC initiative (HIPC II) some private creditors had their claims being cancelled by unilateral decisions stemming from the main G7 official creditors. Even though some of them resorted to various legal systems to challenge such decisions, the enforced cancellation of a contract between a private and a public entity might have major implications for future financial relationships.==== Legal struggles in recovering claims for private creditors might therefore deter them from resuming lending to debt relief countries (assuming that the creditors’ memory is sufficiently long for these events to affect their decisions). On the other hand, debt write-offs improve debt sustainability by creating fiscal space, thereby enhancing borrowing capacity. Investors might therefore be tempted to take advantage of this and lend over the short run in order to secure interest and capital repayments before new debts start piling up. The question is therefore which signal prevails over the other, as in the title of Bulow and Rogoff (1989): “Sovereign debt: Is to forgive to forget?”.====The surge in bond issues by African countries on the international financial markets over the past decade seems to provide an initial answer: investors like countries without debt. In 2011, Graham Stock, Director of JP Morgan's Research Department on Emerging Countries, explained that the increase in commodity prices, high Chinese demand, and the growing quality of institutions on the continent was improving the appeal of African bonds to investors seeking portfolio diversification with attractive returns.==== He went on to say that the debt relief initiatives had significantly improved debt sustainability in these countries, as they had reassured investors about the debtor's capacity to pay over the short and medium run.==== But the story is not that straightforward, because some bond-issuing countries were not LICs or HIPCs (Kenya and Gabon, for instance). The observed surge might then be due to the “irrational exuberance of the markets” in a situation of historically low interest rates in OECD countries. This increase could also be explained by Africa's improved economic prospects attracting new investors such as emerging countries, particularly China, India and Brazil. However, despite increasing access to external private financing, the majority of LICs and HIPCs still keep resorting massively to official financing, which accounts for nearly all external public debt disbursements (see Fig. A.1 in the appendix). Nevertheless, although official creditors switched, at least partly, from loans to grants after the 1982 debt crisis, this trend has been reversing since 2006 due to commitments to increase Official Development Assistance (ODA) in a situation of tension in public finance in donor countries. It is thus likely that bilateral creditors, who had already agreed to cancel a significant part of the claims they had on HIPCs, were then looking for higher returns. Therefore new loans would come with tightened financing conditions such as lowering the level of concessionality (namely by “blending” grants and loans). Such a shift might also have contributed to driving beneficiary governments to seek alternative financing sources, which though more expensive are less burdensome in terms of conditionality.====Bearing in mind the specificities of these LICs and recent developments in the external financing architecture, the present study makes use of a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to investigate whether debt relief provided under the Enhanced HIPC initiative and the MDRI has fostered access to international credit markets for beneficiary governments. Building on comparisons with developments in 65 non-benefiting developing countries (non-HIPCs), this methodology attempts to provide an estimate of the effect of debt relief on external private financing, as compared to a situation where countries would not have participated in these initiatives. Yet since the debt relief initiatives being studied cannot be randomly allocated, the usual endogeneity issues arise and undermine the identification of a genuine causal effect stemming from debt cancellations. We therefore interpret with caution the results highlighted throughout the paper, given that overcoming endogeneity issues in the evaluation of macro-scale programs is tricky. Nevertheless, we provide a large set of robustness checks intended to minimize estimation bias of the debt relief effect on new private financing. These tests encompass sensitivity estimates to control group composition, alternative measures of dependent variables, and the inclusion of various controls and fixed effects. We also apply the synthetic control group method which confirms the findings stemming from the DiD specification.====Our results support a more salient increase in external private borrowing for countries that benefited from debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC initiative and the MDRI. These findings suggest that debt relief initiatives, and the MDRI in particular, helped beneficiary governments in accessing international credit markets and borrowing from foreign private banks. As well as the impact of debt relief on debt flows, we also seek to identify some of the channels that might have prompted this renewed market access and look at the evolution of interest rates charged on new unconventional borrowing by HIPCs. Results do not show any absolute or relative increase in interest rates associated with this new financing but do support a genuine lowering in interest rates for all developing countries (both HIPCs and non-HIPCs). Going further on the mechanisms, the second part of the paper emphasizes the short-term memory of private lenders, who appear not to have sanctioned HIPCs that defaulted on private debts during the debt relief process. This idea is supported by the analysis of commercial creditors’ lawsuits against HIPCs. According to our results, while private creditors seemed reluctant to lend to HIPCs in years when the latter were facing commercial lawsuits, they did not discriminate against HIPCs in the long run irrespective of whether or not these had been subject to legal action from their private creditors. This seeming amnesia on the part of lenders was probably encouraged by the international context in which the renewed access to credit market occurred. Indeed, our findings show that throughout the post-debt relief period the enlarging of financing opportunities mainly took place at the time of the financial downturn experienced by the OECD economies at the end of the 2000s. This leads us to suppose that private foreign banks, motivated by appealing capital returns in developing countries, withdrew from industrialized economies and again turned toward LICs, among which those that had been granted debt relief were favored because of their renewed borrowing capacity. Lastly, additional results suggest that the potential withdrawal of multilateral financial institutions in the wake of the debt relief initiatives probably obliged HIPCs to seek other external financing sources, and therefore turned to private creditors allowing them both to assert their sovereignty and to break free from conditional financing.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a brief background about financing of LICs and the potential effects of debt relief on unconventional borrowing. Section 3 details the data and the methodology used to assess the effect of the debt relief initiatives on external private financing. Section 4 presents the main results and robustness tests. Section 5 investigates the circumstances under which market access by HIPCs has been made possible. Section 6 concludes.",Does debt relief “irresistibly attract banks as honey attracts bees”?

On two occasions in 2007, a railway company caused a fire to break out in the State of Washington. The two fires burned down some of the neighboring properties’ timber. These two incidents led to two companion court cases that made it all the way to the Washington Supreme Court. The court rulings, both made on May 31, 2012, held that the railway company was not liable for timber damages under Washington’s timber trespass statute, despite having acted negligently. As a consequence of these decisions, ","In an economy characterized by costless market transactions and well-defined property rights, the outcome of the dispute is independent of the initial allocation of the rights.==== Underlying this theoretical construct is the idea that the parties will negotiate until they maximize their surplus, given the initial allocation of rights. However, when a court assigns liability, there may be economic effects. This is particularly true when the ex ante rights are not well-defined and market transactions are costly. Therefore, changes in liability assignments can affect the valuation of goods. In fact, “courts directly influence economic activity” when they assign liability to a disputed issue where market transactions are costly and the initial rights are unclear (Coase, 1960, 19).====Various economic models show how liability assignments affect economic activity (====, Calabresi and Melamed, 1972; Brown, 1973; Diamond, 1974; Shavell, 1980a, b; Landes and Posner, 1980; Shavell, 2007). However, there is still only a limited literature on empirically testing how liability assignment affects economic activity (====, Hill and Kiewiet, 2015; Beltrametti and Marrone, 2016). In a related literature, scholars study how United States Supreme Court decisions affect equity prices (====, McWilliams et al., 1993; Hersch, 1994; Stratmann and Verret, 2015; Christensen and Hausman, 2016). Here, scholars study the effect that liability assignments have on the valuation of firms. This paper contributes to both literatures in that it empirically estimates the impact that liability assignment has on the valuation of a commodity and of a firm.====There is a challenge in estimating the effect of liability assignments on prices due to the fact that the liability rule may already be embedded in the price. We attempt to overcome this identification issue by studying the effect of a court decision that clarified liability assignments associated with damage resulting from accidental fires. We argue that the outcome of the court decision had an element of surprise as the parties may have anticipated a different outcome in light of the situational facts of the case. The specific case we study involved sparks from railroads that set neighboring property and timber on fire. In that case, the court, rather than applying a timber trespass statute or waste statute, chose to strictly construe a statute to hold that the timber owners’ only remedy was common law negligence. Considering how courts in neighboring states had previously interpreted similar situations, the actors may have assumed that the railway companies would be strictly liable for such damages.====We test the effect of the change in expectations about liability assignments by analyzing how the court’s decision impacted the winners and losers of the decision. We first test the hypothesis that the timber owners were negatively impacted by estimating the loss they incurred for their timber sales now that the auction winners had to assume additional fire liability. We then test the hypothesis that railway companies were positively impacted by estimating the change in their market value following the court decision.====On two separate occasions in 2007, the operations of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC railway company (“BNSF”) accidently sparked fires that burned down neighboring property to their railway in Washington State. Along with other property damage claims, the plaintiffs sued for triple damages for their burnt timber.==== To correctly establish liability under Washington State’s timber trespass statute, two U.S. District Courts certified questions to the Washington State Supreme Court on whether BNSF violated Washington’s timber trespass statute and therefore owed triple damages for the timber. The two cases, ====. (hereafter, ====) and ====. (hereafter, ====), became companion court cases in the State of Washington’s highest court.==== The court decisions, dated May 31, 2012, stated that BNSF would not be liable for ==== damages to the plaintiff’s timber under Washington’s timber trespass statute or Washington’s fire act. The plaintiffs were only awarded a common law remedy for negligence by the railway.====To test how the court’s assigned liability affected the price of timber, we estimate a triple interaction model and a triple difference model that analyzes timber auction prices associated with higher risk of catching fire, before and after the court case, in three Western states: Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Oregon and Idaho are used as control states.====To estimate how the ruling affected the value of railroad companies, we conduct an event study to test how the liability assignment affected the value of the railway companies operating in Washington State.==== Overall, our findings show a decrease in the value of timber associated with higher risk of fire damage, and an increase in the value of railway companies operating in Washington State following the two court decisions. In particular, timber prices fell in areas of high burn probability, as well as in areas with close proximity to railroads. These findings are consistent with economic models showing how court rulings affect economic activity.====Section II describes the context of the two court cases.

For example, recidivism is affected by the availability of jobs for re-entering offenders (Galbiati et al., 2017, Yang, 2017, Schnepel, 2018), the length of time that a former felon spends searching for a job (Engelhardt, 2010), the experience of incarceration in the life cycle (Apel and Sweeten, 2010, Western, 2002) and the amount of education that an individual has received (Lochner and Moretti, 2004).====While the collateral consequences of a criminal record are observable in terms of labor market and recidivism outcomes, the social implications of a criminal record could be just as severe, but less observable. To start, many housing applications are denied due to criminal records, effectively resulting in geographic sorting of individuals with criminal records.==== Such close proximity to other individuals with prior criminal tendencies could increase the likelihood that an individual engages in future criminal acts (Bayer et al., 2009). Additionally, a prior criminal record can impact a person's ability to advance beyond a criminogenic phase, as criminal backgrounds are a determining factor in college admissions. Finally, having a known criminal conviction can lead to shunning or isolation from the community, which has been associated with addiction, depression and criminal behavior (Raphael, 2010, Blossom and Apsche, 2013). In sum, while criminal records can offer some information about an individual's tendencies, they also put significant boundaries in front of an individual who is attempting to pursue an alternative, less criminal path.====To counteract some of the negative ramifications associated with the stigma of a criminal record, policies have attempted to suppress this information. For example, in an effort to reduce barriers to employment for people with criminal records, the recent practice of “banning the box” requires employers to delay asking about an applicant's criminal record until late in the hiring process. In fact, 34 states, the District of Columbia and the federal government have all enacted similar policies. The allure of such a program is considerable, as it has the potential to eliminate the negative ramifications associated with criminal records. However, the “ban the box” policy is essentially costless for formerly incarcerated individuals.==== As noted in Agan and Starr (2018) and Doleac and Hansen (2018), the “ban the box” policy obfuscated the signal that could have been obtained from knowing a potential job candidate's prior criminal record, which is what is predicted by the theory proposed in Mungan (2018). In its place, employers appear to depend on statistical discrimination in determining the likelihood that an individual has a prior criminal record. In sum, it appears that policies such as “ban the box” do not achieve their desired purpose, as low-skilled minorities face reduced likelihood of employment in locations adopting these policies.====Another, costly, mechanism for removing one's criminal record from the public record exists through the use of expungements. Expungement refers to the legal practice of having one's criminal record sealed such that it is inaccessible to the public through a formal request to the court. Although there are many variations of this practice,==== the commonality among these instruments is that they make a person's criminal record less visible. There are at least two important benefits to expunging one's record. First, their criminal record is not visible to a potential employer. Second, the individual's criminal file is not accessible by the general public, thereby enabling a person to mitigate both the pecuniary and social costs associated with having a criminal record. Thus, expungements may increase specific deterrence (i.e., reduce incentives to recidivate) because a person who has an expunged record has more to lose by committing crime (in the form of social sanctions) than a person who has a visible criminal record.====However, expungements raise a number of concerns. First, if expungements were free for first time offenders, one would expect them to reduce general deterrence, since they reduce the expected costs associated with committing a first offense. Thus, allowing expungements is likely to generate a trade-off between specific and general deterrence. From a theoretical perspective, this trade-off vanishes if one can charge a person a price for expungements that equals his reservation price (see Mungan (2017)). There is no general deterrence effect, because the person is indifferent between not expunging his record and suffering social sanctions and expunging at a cost that equals the expected social sanction associated with having a criminal record. But, the specific deterrence effect is still present, because a person with an expunged record still has more to lose than a person with a visible record, and thus is less likely to commit crime again. However, research in behavioral economics has shown that the mere fact of introducing a price incentive for morally reprehensible acts may decrease the frequency of desired behaviors instead of increasing it (see Gneezy and Rustichini (2000a) for an experimental analysis of the signal that a price may convey about the social appropriateness of a behavior). Mungan (2017) provides theoretical support for the proposition that expungements can decrease specific deterrence without increasing general deterrence if priced appropriately. In this paper, we empirically identify the effect of expungement on criminal behavior and show how this effect varies with expungement cost.====Empirical investigations of the impact of expungement on criminal recidivism are complicated by numerous factors, which is likely the reason that empirical investigations using observational data do not exist (see Prescott and Starr (2020)). To start, wealthier people are often more likely to utilize expungements, because in many cases there are significant costs and barriers to obtaining them. Since criminal conduct and income are likely related through observable and unobservable channels, it would be difficult if not impossible to disentangle the impact of income versus expungements on the likelihood an individual recidivates. Also, the discretion of the court might permit expungements for certain crimes, but not other crimes. For example, drunk driving might be an expungeable offense, whereas distribution of drugs might not be. Once again, this could result in the discretion of the court not permitting expungement for crimes that have a higher likelihood of being associated with minorities.====In scenarios where we cannot identify the causal effect of a particular policy on criminal outcomes using observational data, it is natural to turn to laboratory experiments. Indeed there is precedent for examining criminal behavior and legal instruments using lab experiments. For example, Anderson et al. (2017) note that a decreasing penalty structure could optimally deter criminal activity, but that increasing penalty structures are ubiquitous in the criminal code. As such, they explore declining versus escalating penalty structures in the lab. Although the examination of law enforcement on criminal activities has been studied using observational data (e.g. Kessler and Levitt, 1999), identifying causal estimates are difficult (see DeAngelo and Hansen (2014) for example). So, to examine the impact of law enforcement strategies on deterrence, numerous experimental studies have been utilized (Schildberg-Hoerisch and Strassmair, 2012, DeAngelo and Charness, 2012, Friesen, 2012). Lastly, and most closely related to the current work, Pager (2007) experimentally demonstrates that criminal records “mark” their owners with a negative job credential, which renders illegal behaviors more appealing for individuals with a criminal record compared to those with no criminal record.====In this article we use a laboratory experiment to study the effects of expungements on general and specific deterrence. We compare the criminal behavior in a treatment without expungement with treatments with expungment options priced at different levels (low, medium, high). Our analysis generates multiple conclusions. First, offenders are less likely to expunge when expungement price is high. Second, the proportion of crimes in the first stage is lowest in the treatment where expungement costs are highest. Third, the overall proportion of offenses in the second stage is not statistically different between our treatments, although the few that commit crime in the first stage in the overpriced treatment have a higher probability of recidivating in the second round.====Overall, our experiment shows that, from a general deterrence perspective, it is better to implement expungements at high prices. We present a potential explanation for this result. We argue that the price to expunge one's criminal record may be interpreted by some subjects as a proxy of the moral reprehensibility of the offense. In this case, subjects who have strong social preferences may find the idea of committing an offense less attractive as the price of the expungement increases. However, our results suggest that this relationship is non monotonic since we find no difference in crime rates between the treatment with a moderate price and the treatment with a low price for expungement, which is in line with Gneezy and Rustichini (2000b).",The price of expungements,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301897,30 December 2020,2020,Research Article,90.0

Although the results from these studies uniformly suggest that police spending is cost justified, it is worth exploring whether police-like alternatives can deter crime even more cheaply. Unarmed private security personnel that conspicuously patrol a neighborhood have the potential to cheaply leverage the ability of police to be informed of crimes while also providing direct deterrence on their own. In the Fall of 2013, a neighborhood in Oakland, CA mounted a campaign to provide observe and report security patrols to augment the publicly provided policing in the area. While the initial effect of the additional security was a drop in crime, it quickly evaporated, calling into question the value of security forces that do not have the ability to apprehend criminals directly.","The empirical micro literature demonstrates that police have a large deterrent effect on crime. Although Levitt’s (1997) important contribution was later shown to be in error (McCrary, 2002; Levitt, 2002), subsequent credible work finds that elasticities of crime with respect to police are likely substantial at least over very short periods (Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004; Klick and Tabarrok, 2005; and Draca et al., 2011). These short-term elasticities are largely borne out over the longer term in designs that, while perhaps not sharing as dramatic a shock for identification purposes as the short-term studies, likely involve more policy relevant settings (Evans and Owens, 2007; MacDonald et al., 2016). The criminology literature on hot spot policing likewise provides persuasive evidence from randomized field experiments as well (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995; Braga et al., 1999; Braga and Bond, 2008; Ratcliffe et al., 2011). In a benefit cost framework, these estimates imply that police provide considerable social value with Chalfin and McCrary (2018) suggesting that an additional dollar spent on police leads to more than $1.60 in social benefit, implying that many jurisdictions may be substantially under-policed.====That said, depending on the mechanism by which police generate deterrence, it might be possible to generate these benefits at substantially lower cost. If the mere presence of a conspicuous monitor generates deterrence, uniformed security guards are likely to be much cheaper than police due to reduced training costs as well as the possibility of hiring personnel outside of the civil service and/or police union framework. Security guards acting in an observe and report capacity might also effectively leverage police manpower, serving systematically as additional eyes and ears on the street.====The work on Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) at least hints in this direction (Brooks, 2008; Cook and MacDonald, 2011). In BIDs, neighborhoods voluntarily pay more in taxes to supply additional public goods, including increased security. These analyses have generally found that the spending leads to reductions in crime, but it is not generally possible to sort out the effects of each individual portion of the spending, which in addition to supplying security guards also generally includes spending on sanitation projects and security cameras. Also, the degree of community support required for the creation of the BIDs may raise some endogeneity concerns due to changes in unobservable civic engagement.====To focus on a plausibly exogenous shock that arguably isolates the effect of observe and report type security patrols alone, we examine the introduction of unarmed patrols in the Lower Rockridge neighborhood of Oakland in late 2013. These patrols were financed by a crowd funding campaign after a resident was the victim of an armed robbery at a carpool station in the neighborhood. Using geo-coded crime data from 2007 to 2016, we examine the effect of these patrols on crime using difference in difference and synthetic control methods. Although the initial effect of these patrols was to lower crime, this decline disappeared within six months.====These results suggest that conspicuous monitors are insufficient to generate the deterrent effect associated with police. Presumably, as criminals learn that the monitors do little more than is done by regular residents alone, their criminal behavior resumes unimpeded. The hope that lower cost observe and report security patrols might prove to be lower cost substitutes for police officers is not borne out. For private security to generate comparable deterrence, it appears as though something like the armed patrols with arrest powers studied in MacDonald, Klick, and Grunwald (2016) might be necessary.====In the following sections, we discuss the value of estimating the deterrence effect of alternative security patrols as substitutes for police patrols. We also provide background for the private security patrol intervention in Oakland, describe the data, research design, results, and conclusions.",The ineffectiveness of ‘observe and report’ patrols on crime,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014481882030185X,29 December 2020,2020,Research Article,91.0

In contrast to rigid contracts, flexible contract terms may be perceived in a self-serving manner and, therefore, the contract parties might form subjective entitlements. This reference-dependent perception of flexible contract terms leads to a trade-off of the contractual form. While flexible contracts are, in theory, deemed preferable to rigid contracts, frustrated subjective entitlements may lead to perfunctory performance and shading behavior that is absent in rigid contracts. The results of our replication are mixed. Our findings imply further support for ====’s contracts as reference point hypothesis. However, our replication does not provide reliable evidence for the idea that competition creates objectivity and enhances perceived fairness of the contract terms.","In a recent influential paper of their academic corpus, Hart and Moore (2008) develop the idea that contracts serve as reference points in trading relationships. An ex ante contract might shape contract parties’ subjective entitlements regarding ex post outcomes of a trade: parties might feel entitled to different outcomes within the negotiated contract. Importantly, parties do not form any entitlements regarding outcomes outside of the contract, because ex ante competition during negotiating of the contract supposedly provides objectivity to the contract terms and market participants perceive the initial contract as fair.====Contract parties’ subjective entitlements can lead to a trade-off between contractual rigidity and flexibility in a situation where uncertainty about the trading environment resolves over time. A ==== specifies a price ex ante, bearing the risk of making ex post trade impossible when costs turn out to be high. By contrast, ==== only fix an interval of possible trading prices and appear, in principle, advantageous as parties can adjust to the state of nature when uncertainty resolves. However, Hart and Moore (2008) argue that flexible contracts come with the downside that parties suffer from a ==== and therefore might form reference points at distant ends of the specified price interval. Subsequently, if a party’s perceived entitlement is frustrated, she is aggrieved and ==== by providing perfunctory rather than consummate performance. As a result, rigid contracts might be more attractive than flexible contracts.====Hart and Moore (2008)’s theory is one of the most important developments in recent years in the field of contract theory. The idea can explain long-term contracts and employment contracts that fix wages in advance and leave discretion to the employer. The paper started a literature stream that tries to shed new light on the theory of the firm with the help of behavioral insights, the investigation of shading behavior through reference points being at its core. This is an instance where laboratory experiments can fruitfully serve as a wind tunnel and empirical and theoretical work naturally go hand in hand.====Fehr et al. (2011) provide the first direct test of the Hart and Moore (2008) model by conducting a laboratory experiment. In their baseline treatment, participants take on either the role of a buyer or the role of a seller. Buyers determine the contract type and the contracts are auctioned off to the sellers. Uncertainty is introduced as the sellers’ production cost is initially unknown. Then uncertainty resolves and – given trade is possible – either the transaction is carried out at the ex ante fixed price (rigid contract) or the buyer can choose the final price within the ex ante determined interval (flexible contract). Finally, sellers can decide whether to shade and reduce the product’s value for the buyer. Results in Fehr et al. (2011) largely confirm the model’s predictions, including the hypothesis of increased shading rates in flexible contracts.====Since then, researchers have modified the experimental setup in order to investigate several research questions regarding the underlying theory and the influence of various aspects of the decision environment (Fehr et al., 2009, Fehr et al., 2011, Fehr et al., 2015, Fehr et al., 2019, Erlei and Reinhold, 2016). In addition to their baseline treatment, Fehr et al. (2011) run a robustness check to study whether competition indeed provides objectivity to the contract terms. Leaving the experimental setup otherwise constant, they remove the competitive auction. After buyers determine the contract type, contracts are randomly allocated to the sellers and the auction outcome is randomly drawn from the results obtained when auctions were present. Fehr et al. (2011) find that when the transaction is governed by rigid contracts, the removal of ex ante competition leads to significantly increased shading behavior.====Also Fehr et al. (2009) study the role of competition in providing objectivity to the negotiated contract terms. Crucially, they implement the removal of competition slightly differently in their experimental setup: the seller is informed about the draw of the auction outcome before determining the contract type. In direct comparison to the baseline data in Fehr et al. (2011)====, shading rates in rigid contracts spike. Shading rates are about twice as high compared to the baseline data and, in fact, sellers under rigid contracts turn out to shade even more often than sellers under flexible contracts. This finding is important as it suggests that we investigate a contracting situation where details of the experimental setup might have considerable influence on observed shading behavior.====Fehr et al. (2015) investigate the influence of informal agreements. Buyers can make non-binding price announcements and, by doing so, shape seller’s expectations. Fehr et al. (2015) find that this opportunity moderately reduces shading rates in flexible contracts. Moreover, in another variation the researchers allow buyers to revise the contract ex post by granting the unilateral right to replace the existing contract with a new one. The results suggest that writing a simple (rigid) contract and revise it ex post if needed, rather than anticipating and including future contingencies in a (flexible) contract from the outset, can under specific circumstances be beneficial for parties. The study also collects additional baseline data with exactly the same setup as in Fehr et al. (2011) and finds similar results, especially very similar shading rates.====While communication in Fehr et al. (2015)’s study happens unilateral from buyer to seller, in a very recent working paper Fehr et al. (2019) extend communication between the parties to free-form. In contrast to nonbinding unilateral price announcements, the evidence from Fehr et al. (2019) indicates that free-form communication increases the potential for aggrievement on the seller-side. The study also replicates the baseline treatment from Fehr et al. (2011) with the difference that they employ a perfect stranger matching, i.e., participants meet each other at most once during the course of the experiment. In this baseline treatment, sellers are almost twice as likely to shade under rigid contracts as in Fehr et al. (2011) (10% compared to 6%).====Finally, another recent paper by Erlei and Reinhold (2016) explores the role of reciprocity during contract choice, i.e., buyers unilaterally selecting the contract type may trigger different responses from buyers. When Erlei and Reinhold (2016) externalize contract choice to a random device, their results indicate that by shading sellers indeed punish buyers for choosing rigid contracts. As the researchers also conduct a baseline treatment, their results also speak to the core idea of the underlying theory. In this regard, the study presents mixed evidence. Erlei and Reinhold (2016) find evidence for reference point effects. Moreover, results regarding many of the experiment’s outcomes (e.g., auction outcomes and the relative frequency of contract types) are similar to Fehr et al. (2011)’s results. But Erlei and Reinhold (2016) also observe substantially different shading behavior in the baseline treatment: shading rates under rigid contracts appear to be three times higher (19.5% compared to 6%). In their baseline treatment, Erlei and Reinhold (2016) deviate in two respects from the setup in Fehr et al. (2011), which may influence results. First, the clock auctions used to auction off contracts to the sellers are conducted simultaneously (rather than consecutively). This design difference implies that sellers need to focus on one of the auctions first, which increases the chance of the leaving the other contract to another seller. That is, competitive forces are slightly reduced. Additionally, Erlei and Reinhold (2016) do not provide aggregate information at the end of each period, thereby changing speed and (maybe) direction of learning.====Reference-point driven shading behavior is the most critical aspect for the trade-off between contractual forms. Experimental results so far provide matching evidence on many of the contractual situation’s outcomes in support of Fehr et al. (2011)’s original findings. However, baseline shading behavior in rigid contracts, which should not occur at all according to Hart and Moore (2008)’s theory, differs widely between prior studies. In those studies shading rates range from almost negligible 5% to substantial 19%. Many of the prior studies also changed details of the experimental setup, which complicates recognizing the source of such fluctuating shading rates in rigid contracts. Therefore, we replicate Fehr et al. (2011)’s original theory test to shed additional light on the validity of Hart and Moore (2008)’s model. We directly replicate their baseline treatment and the no-competition robustness check, with a strong focus on shading rates. We then use our data and the data from Fehr et al. (2011) and Fehr et al. (2015) to feed our replication analysis and receive a more complete picture.====The results of our replication are mixed. In the replicated baseline treatment, we find that sellers under flexible contracts shade more often than sellers under rigid contracts. With regard to this result, our replication analysis suggests replication success. In the no-competition treatment, we do not find that removing competition during the contracting stage increases shading rates. This result differs from the result of Fehr et al. (2011). Moreover, our replication analysis does not unambiguously suggest replication success regarding this finding. Some auxiliary results suggest (1) that shading behavior is contingent on reference-dependent measures of aggrievement both in the baseline treatment and the no-competition treatment, (2) that flexible contracts are associated with lower auction outcomes after learning effects have been accounted for, and (3) that shading behavior under rigid contracts is both increased and more heterogeneous as compared to Fehr et al. (2011)’s results. With regard to the Hart and Moore (2008)’s theory, our results imply further support for their contracts as reference point hypothesis. However, our replication does not provide supporting evidence for the idea that competition creates objectivity and enhances perceived fairness of the contract terms.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 summarizes the experimental design of the original study. Section 3 reports the details of the replication study.

This study contributes to this debate by examining the relationship between foreign direct investment net inflows and three judicial institutions of property rights protection: judicial contract enforcement, judicial independence, and judicial impartiality. I evaluate this relationship by applying the system-GMM estimation approach to a sample of 150 countries covering the period 2000–16. I find robust evidence of positive relationships between FDI net inflows and both judicial independence and judicial impartiality. On the other hand, judicial contract enforcement appears to be weakly related to FDI net inflows. The results are robust to alternative specifications and estimation methods, including the instrumental variables approach. While the findings of this study reinforce the notion that host country institutions matter for foreign direct investment, they, more importantly, underscore the merits of unbundling institutions to understand their impact on multinational firm activity.","With the continuing expansion of multinational enterprise (MNE) activity, there has been an exponential growth in global foreign direct investment (FDI) during the last few decades. In 2017, global FDI inflow reached two trillion dollars.==== This number corresponds roughly to 277 US dollars per capita. However, there is a sizable variation in FDI inflows across countries. For instance, while Chile received, on average, 717 dollars of FDI per capita annually over the last two decades, the same figure was barely above 200 dollars for Argentina. It appears that MNEs are selective with respect to the countries in which they invest. If this is indeed the case, then what explains this selection and the ensuing variation in the spatial distribution of FDI?====In the theory of international trade, firms invest in certain countries for reasons that have to do with the standard elements in the comparative advantage framework. These reasons could be paraphrased in terms of motivations to exploit market opportunities, scarce resources, and capabilities in foreign locations. Nevertheless, the benefits associated with these motivations are susceptible to various risk factors stemming not only from the macroeconomic environment but also from the institutional environment. For instance, in 2006, the Russian government forced Royal Dutch Shell and its partners to hand over the majority stake in the $22 billion Sakhalin II oil and gas project to Gasprom, a state-owned Russian energy firm, for just $7.5 billion (Lustgarten, 2007). Facing a threat of a major lawsuit in Russia, Shell did not have a choice but to comply. Not surprisingly, recent survey evidence suggests that multinational firms are concerned most about outright expropriation or exploitative regulation by host-country governments (Kim et al., 2019). Thus, a more comprehensive treatment of MNEs’ behavior, one that accounts for the institutional environment, is needed to explain the FDI location.====Given the role of institutions in safeguarding property rights, recently, there has been a growing emphasis on the institutional environment as a key determinant of international trade and investment (for instance, see Belloc, 2006; Busse and Hefeker, 2007). Despite the recent efforts, however, we have a limited empirical understanding of how various institutions are related to FDI. In particular, only a few studies have so far examined the relationship between FDI and specific aspects of the legal system in host countries. On the other hand, as the legal origins literature argues, there are cross-country differences in judicial institutions, and these differences have significant economic consequences (Chang and Smith, 2012; Glaeser and Shleifer, 2002; La Porta et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2018). Accordingly, this study attempts to examine whether FDI, as measured by the per-capita FDI net inflow, is related to the judicial institutions of property rights protection, namely, judicial contract enforcement, judicial independence, and judicial impartiality in a host country.====Note that once an MNE makes a sunk-cost investment in a foreign country, what Klein et al. (1978, p. 298) call “appropriable quasi-rents” are created.==== This shifts the bargaining power in favor of the local private trading partners as well as the host government, all of whom may attempt to reap a larger share of the quasi-rents. Thus, a foreign investment incurs transaction cost originating from two sources. One source has to do with frictions in transactions between private economic agents. Contracting institutions are utilized to reduce this sort of transaction cost and facilitate mutually beneficial trade between private entities. In particular, MNEs often choose to govern their business relationship with local actors through contracts. Nevertheless, the usefulness of contracts in eliminating opportunistic behavior and protecting property rights is limited to the extent contracts are enforceable in a timely and cost-efficient manner. This paper examines the relationship between FDI and the efficiency of ====, i.e., the cost and the time it takes to resolve a contractual dispute through the judicial system. I expect that FDI increases in countries with efficient judicial contract enforcement.====The other source of transaction cost is related to the state’s coercive power that could be used arbitrarily by either state officials or politically connected private elites to expropriate private property. In this case, institutions designed to constrain the executive power of the government and protect private citizen’s property rights against the state power and other elites reduce transaction costs and encourage investment. While the literature offers several conceptualizations of the institutions that constrain the political elite, in this paper, I focus on two rarely investigated institutional properties of the judicial system: ==== and ====. Judicial independence refers to the absence of undue political influence in the judicial system. The judiciary would be independent to the extent that other branches of the government, powerful interest groups, and elites are not able to influence the selection, career outcomes, perks, and compensation of judges and prosecutors (Feld and Voigt, 2003; Hanssen, 2004). Judicial impartiality, on the other hand, refers to the attitude of fairness in judgment. Although judicial impartiality is conceptually related to judicial independence, a necessary condition for judicial impartiality, there are important differences between the two concepts. Whereas judicial independence rests mainly on the separation of powers within the government, judicial impartiality depends on the judiciary not harboring personal prejudice or bias towards the matter at hand. For instance, the prevalence of bribing practice would remove the chances of fair treatment even when the judiciary is perfectly independent. An independent and impartial judiciary can impose a cost on arbitrarily altering political and economic institutions and protect private property rights from extortion and expropriation by the government or other powerful interest groups (La Porta et al., 2004). Thus, countries with independent and impartial judiciary would attract higher levels of FDI.====While these conjectures are quite intuitive, the relationships may not show up in the data, or they may not be robust because, as I will discuss, there are alternative mechanisms, both formal and informal, that may protect property rights. I analyze these relationships by exploiting a large sample of panel data in a system-GMM framework. The results demonstrate a positive relationship between per-capita FDI net inflow and both judicial independence and judicial impartiality. On the other hand, judicial contract enforcement is related to per-capita FDI net inflow only for countries outside the OECD. These findings are quite robust to several alternative specifications and estimation techniques, including instrumental variables estimation.====There are several implications of these results. First, the results demonstrate the importance of both judicial independence and judicial impartiality in the MNEs’ global activity and hence the need for a deeper understanding of the impact of nuances in countries’ judicial systems and practices. Second, the findings have implications for the literature on the consequences of countries’ legal origins (see, e.g., Bradford et al., 2020; La Porta et al., 1997, 1998; 2008; Zhang et al., 2018). Consistent with this literature, I find that there is a considerable cross-country heterogeneity in terms of judicial institutions and that this heterogeneity matters for the location of FDI. Third, the findings contribute to the current debate on how institutions may be sources of comparative advantage (or disadvantage) in international trade (Belloc and Bowles, 2017; Greif, 1993, 2012; Nunn and Trefler, 2014). Assuming that institutions affect transaction costs, my findings suggest that judicial institutions are related to the investment attractiveness of countries, possibly through their impact on the transaction cost of foreign investment.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews background literature on the relationship between institutions and FDI. Section 3 describes the empirical specification and the estimation approach. Section 4 describes the sample, data sources, and measures.

For small incremental innovations, PAEs prefer the injunctive regime because negotiated license fees are higher. For higher value innovations, license fees are lower in the injunctive regime and PAEs would prefer the fee-based regime, contrary to the presumption that injunctive regimes necessarily favor PAEs.","Prior to mid-2006, an important aspect of U.S. patent infringement cases was the possibility of a court-imposed injunction forcing the infringing firm to stop using the patented technology. The threat of such “injunctive relief” would sometimes induce firms accused of infringement to agree to seemingly excessive settlements rather than risk a costly disruption of business arising from an injunction. For example, in early 2006, smartphone producer Research in Motion (RIM) settled a questionable patent infringement case filed by NTP for a license fee of $612.5 million rather than face a possible injunction that would suspend its U.S. sales.====The U.S. legal landscape changed in 2006, when the U.S. Supreme Court reached a unanimous decision in the patent infringement case ====. This important decision dramatically reduced the use of injunctive relief, as it affirmed that U.S. district courts should use injunctive relief only when standard remedies such as license fees or other monetary awards are not adequate. Concern about patent assertion entities==== (PAEs), many of whom are pejoratively referred to as “patent trolls”, was an important consideration for at least some of the justices in the eBay decision.====But does replacing injunctive relief with fee-based relief necessarily restrain aggressive bargaining by PAEs? In this paper, we focus on the comparative economic properties of injunctive and fee-based legal regimes using a simple model that we believe captures important economic principles at work in patent infringement cases. Our primary research question is whether a PAE would, as intuition suggests, generally prefer a legal regime that relies on injunctions, or whether a PAE would sometimes prefer a fee-based legal regime.====We also consider the comparative effects of the two regimes more broadly, including the effects on infringing firms and on consumers. Our analysis incorporates Nash bargaining between a PAE and an infringing firm over a license fee. An important feature of the model is that incentives in Nash bargaining differ depending on whether the case is filed in an injunctive regime or a fee-based regime, implying different outcomes in the two regimes. We focus on the case in which the patented innovation is a cost-reducing or process innovation.====Using the distinction between “incremental” and “drastic” innovations first introduced by Arrow (1962), we show that the size of the patented innovation is important in determining which regime would be preferred by a PAE and in determining other economic effects of the infringement claim. If the cost-reducing value of the innovation is at the low end of the incremental category, PAEs would prefer a regime of injunctive relief, consistent with standard intuition. For innovations at the high end of the incremental category and for drastic innovations, we obtain the striking result that PAEs would prefer a fee-based regime.====The central insight is that a PAE has a lot to lose from an injunction as it earns no revenue in that case, and its potential loss from foregone license fee revenue is higher if the patented innovation is larger (more valuable). With sufficiently large innovations, the PAE has more to lose from an injunction than the infringing firm, and this weakens its bargaining power in the injunctive regime.====Section 2 of the paper provides a brief literature review along with relevant institutional background. Section 3 introduces our model, discusses our key assumptions, and shows how negotiated or court-imposed license fees affect output. Section 4 presents the analysis of Nash bargaining over the license fee for each legal regime and Section 5 undertakes an economic comparison of the two regimes. Section 6 examines an extension to our basic model in which the infringing firm has the option of working around the patented innovation by paying a fixed restructuring cost. Section 7 discusses extensions to consider uncertainty, litigation costs, fixed license fees, alternative fair value license fees, and asymmetric bargaining power.

The appeal of Harris & Simons’ framework is that it created a simple, intuitive approach to delineating markets—with relatively parsimonious data requirements. After over a decade of use, however, economists began to propose alternative approaches to the classic critical loss analysis—using theory to impose structure on firm-level demand. This allowed researchers to reformulate the critical loss test in terms of diversion ratios. The purpose of this paper is to discuss when the classic, market-level approach to critical loss is more appropriate and when firm-level critical loss offers an important refinement. We illustrate, with a detailed example, that under certain plausible demand scenarios, a diversion-based firm-level analysis could easily reach the wrong answer on market definition. Thus, the analyst needs to carefully study the competitive environment before deciding on the appropriate analysis. As a bottom line, the choice between market-level and firm-level analysis depends on the specific factual situation.","Market definition continues to play an important role in merger analysis, as it defines the playing field and identifies the significant rivals that interact and drive the competitive process. Defining a systematic approach to market definition has not been easy. In ==== and ==== the Supreme Court noted interchangeability in use and cross elasticities of demand as important considerations.==== The 1982 Department of Justice’s ==== introduced the Hypothetical Monopolist Test (HMT) that used a small, but significant and non-transitory increase in price (SSNIP) of typically five or ten percent to enable a systematic approach to market definition.==== Harris & Simons (H&S) developed a quantitative method to implement the HMT that uses a market-level “critical loss” analysis.====The H&S critical loss analysis is a simple and intuitive test. The first step calculates the ====, which is the maximum loss in sales that the hypothetical monopolist controlling a candidate market could incur (given the size of the SSNIP) before the price increase would reduce its profits.==== The second step estimates the ==== expected from the SSNIP from evidence of substitution from products within the candidate market to goods outside of it. If the actual loss is less than the critical loss, the H&S test concludes the candidate market forms a product market; otherwise, the test repeats with a broader candidate market. Critical loss analysis has proven broadly applicable both at the agencies and in court.====Subsequently, Katz & Shapiro (K&S) and O’Brien & Wickelgren (O&W) modified the H&S critical loss model to use firm-level demand functions.==== Specifically, K&S and O&W bounded the hypothetical monopolist’s actual loss to the outside good from a price increase of a single product, via the Lerner Index,==== and reformulated the critical loss analysis in terms of diversion ratios.====One key difference between the H&S and the K&S-O&W approaches is how the SSNIP is actually implemented.==== The H&S approach intuitively imposes a ==== price increase (that is, the same SSNIP across all the products in the candidate market). Given that the H&S approach raises price across the whole market, we refer to it as a “market-level” approach. The K&S-O&W approach, however, focuses on a “firm-level” approach that models the competitive process using theory and assumptions to back out implications for the critical loss test.==== Given this firm-level heritage, the K&S-O&W approach works particularly well for a single product SSNIP (that is, the hypothetical monopolist raises the price of only one product in the candidate market).==== While this can be generalized to a uniform SSNIP, this generalization is dependent on the structure imposed on the competitive process.====For instance, the formulations presented in O&W use linear and constant-elasticity demand curves; the applicability of the Lerner Equation; and, for expositional purposes, assumptions of symmetry and Bertrand competition.==== While these are certainly standard assumptions in various contexts—they remain assumptions.==== O&W and K&S rightly state that their firm-level approach of modeling the pre-merger competitive process to derive the critical loss test can be adapted to different assumptions and models of competition. What must be avoided, however, is applying the critical loss formulas, as currently expressed in O&W and K&S, without understanding that they are built for very specific types of demand curves and competitive environments. We illustrate this point with nonlinear demand curves. Given the prominence of O&W and K&S in the critical loss literature, practitioners may assume that, like the market-level approach to critical loss, the firm-level formulas are broadly applicable across a range of assumptions and therefore may be used without modification in situations where they are not appropriate.==== In fact, we show that O&W themselves did not adjust their adding up assumptions when calculating the critical loss for constant elasticity of demand.====In this paper, we argue that the classic, market-level critical loss framework is still quite useful, has the benefit of being robust to various market conditions, and is not dependent on specific market characteristics.==== In contrast, the firm-level critical loss formula, generalized for a uniform SSNIP, will change depending on different market assumptions. As currently formulated, it is precise in only specific circumstances, because the authors use partial derivatives to derive their equations in terms of various own- and cross-elasticities or diversion ratios rather than actually raising both prices at the same time.====The firm-level test, as described in O&W, is implemented as follows. Suppose there are three products in a candidate market, and the price increase is broken up into four steps. (1) The price is increased for product 1. (2) The product’s loss to the outside good is calculated as the product’s loss minus diversion to other products within the market. (3) The same calculation is made separately for product 2, and then separately again for product 3. (4) Total diversion to the outside good is found by adding up the three individual calculations of diversion to the outside good.==== The question comes down to whether a uniform SSNIP can be implemented by raising the price of one good at a time and adding up the diversion to the outside good from each individual price increase. The description in K&S is somewhat different, in that they acknowledge all prices ==== be raised in a uniform SSNIP, though their paper implements only single firm price increases, as an approximation.====In this paper, we demonstrate that with a nonlinear demand, raising one price at a time and adding the effects can only approximate a simultaneous price increase.==== This approximation may be good or bad. For example, the approximation is bad when customers are essentially indifferent between three or more products; diversion between two of them will be high if one price increases but will be nil if the prices of both increase and customers have the option to choose a third, nearly as desired, good. The problem induced by nonlinearity is that the firm-level approach (as it is currently formulated and implemented) relies on approximating quantity changes by raising one price at a time, holding other prices constant at the pre-SSNIP price; but in a nonlinear model the quantity change due to changing one price can depend on the levels of the other prices in the model. (This happens when the model is not linear in the terms containing prices.) The firm level approach, as implemented, ignores the levels of the other prices. We illustrate these differences with detailed examples.====In sum, our commentary goes to the ==== of the specific formulas given in O&W and K&S—rather than the firm-level approach in of itself. Implementations of firm-level critical loss require sufficient evidence on substitution patterns to justify the required assumptions. Absent these justifications and evidence regarding the structure of demand and the appropriate competitive model, the market-level critical loss offers a more general approach. If substantial differences are found between the two approaches, additional work is necessary to show which approach is more suitable for the specific competitive process.====Section II lays the foundation of market definition and the hypothetical monopolist test. The standard H&S critical loss analysis is presented in Section III. Section IV discusses the 1992 changes in the ==== (====) and how unilateral effects theory morphed critical loss analysis from a market-level exercise to a firm-level one.==== Section V presents a numerical example that quantifies how the firm-level approach of “adding up” to predict the impact of a uniform SSNIP may underestimate the actual loss and then ends with a discussion of application issues.

We analyze the differential effects of antitakeover provisions using the high order ","For decades, economics and law researchers have been analyzing how antitakeover provisions impact firm performance but there is no consensus on the real effects of takeover defenses (Burkart and Panunzi, 2006; Cremers and Ferrell, 2014). Another stream of research argues that antitakeover provisions like staggered boards, poison pills and unequal voting rights are inefficient as they diminish management accountability to shareholders and are causal antecedents to managerial moral hazard and low firm value (Faleye, 2007; Hartzell et al., 2004; Bebchuk et al., 2002; Bebchuk and Cohen, 2005; Chen et al., 2018; Gompers et al., 2003, Bebchuk et al., 2009; Cohen and Wang, 2013). In contrast, another strand of literature reveals that antitakeover provisions increase shareholder wealth and promote managers’ commitment towards long term investments (Johnson et al., 2015; Cremers et al., 2017; Chemmanur and Tian, 2017). Thus, whether antitakeover provisions discourage or promote long term investments is still an empirical question. In this paper we visit this contested area and examine how three of the most potent anti-takeover mechanisms influence firm innovation investment decisions in an Asian setting.====We draw our discussion from two conflicting theoretical perspectives. According to the agency theory perspective, low external monitoring increases the room for managerial moral hazard. This implies that any arrangement that gives more authority to the board and diminishes the probability that managers will be replaced for incompetence or that protects the manager from being disciplined by the market through takeover threats leads to complacency and a quiet life, which is value-destroying to the firm (Jensen, 1988). Managers shirk performance, extract more rents and focus on routine projects with minimal benefits to shareholders when more authority is given to the board (Jensen, 1988). Thus, the external oversight and pressure from the market for corporate control induce managers to concentrate on valuable innovative projects. Takeover threats eliminate managerial moral hazard, as managers are forced to invest efficiently in valuable long term projects to reduce the risk of takeover and to avoid job losses (Bebchuk et al., 2009; Jensen, 1988). Thus, from this view antitakeover provisions are associated with low firm value and underinvestment in long term valuable projects====Another stream of literature argues that too much pressure from the market for corporate control and from myopic shareholders may encourage a quiet life and a “play it safe” attitude. Stein (1988) theoretical model proposes that due to pricing inefficiencies of intangible assets, insulating managers from takeover threats can alleviate myopic behavior exacerbated by the market for corporate control. Due to market imperfections, investors can not accurately evaluate the value of long-term innovative projects resulting to undervaluation of innovative companies and increased exposure to opportunistic bidders (Chemmanur and Jiao, 2012; Humphery-Jenner, 2014). Thus, to protect their jobs and shareholder interests, managers overinvest in short-term investments with quick payoffs (Antia et al., 2010; Shleifer and Vishny, 1989; Stein, 1988; Drobetz & Momtaz, 2020).====Also, antitakeover provisions like staggered boards, poison pills and unequal voting rights can promote an increase in long term investments by strengthening the relationships between the firm and its stakeholders (Cen et al., 2016; Cremers et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2015; Knoeber, 1986; Shleifer and Summers, 1988). Takeover threats impose costs by discouraging major stakeholders like suppliers and customers from entering into implicit agreements with exposed firms since prior contracts may be reversed after a successful takeover bid. Thus, antitakeover provisions can act as a guarantee that the firm’s operating strategy will not be disrupted via a takeover and thus reduces the risk of imposed costs on the stakeholders after a takeover. Therefore, according to the bonding hypothesis, antitakeover provisions like staggered board, unequal voting rights and poison pill clauses insulate directors against market interference, and provide incentives for long-term value creation.====Considering the controversies in literature on the incremental effect of governance provisions on firm value, this research departs from prior studies that focus on developed markets and examines the real effects of anti-takeover provisions on R&D investments in emerging markets based on these competing hypotheses. To test our hypotheses, we assemble a sample of firms from six Asian countries from 2010 to 2017 and examine the implications of staggered board provisions, unequal voting rights provisions and poison pills on innovation intensity. This study further goes on to analyze the responsiveness of R&D to the firm’s investment opportunity set. This caveat helps us examine the existence of managerial moral hazard in firms that have less external monitoring.====Studying the real effects of governance provisions on firm performance is challenging due to endogeneity issues. We thus improve our analysis by employing the high order fixed effects panel data model that controls for firm fixed effects, industry-year fixed effects and country-year fixed effects. This helps us minimize the problem of omitted variables at firm, industry and country level, and enables us to observe the differential effects on firms’ innovation intensity before and after the firms adopt the governance provisions. We find that firms with staggered boards invest less in R&D investments. This study’s findings show that unequal voting rights and poison pills have no relationship with innovation intensity.====Next, we construct four indices using staggered board provisions, unequal voting rights provisions and poison pill provisions. We find that a combination of staggered boards, poison pills and unequal voting rights provisions is negatively related to firm investment in R&D activities. The combination of a staggered board and a poison pill has a more significant relationship. We do not observe any significant relationship between the combinations of a staggered board and unequal voting rights, and unequal voting rights and poison pill provisions with innovation intensity. The study results continue to hold using various measures of innovation intensity. Our study evidence supports that poison pill provisions have no effect on their own but a combination of a staggered board and a poison pill contributes to managerial entrenchment. Cross sectional analyses show that the negative effect of staggered boards on R&D investment is more pronounced for old firms, large firms, firms with poor corporate governance, opaque firms, less indebted firms and firms with more cash holdings.====We also examine the social efficiency of antitakeover provisions and find that staggered boards decrease the sensitivity of R&D investments to the investment opportunity sets, resulting to higher innovative inefficiency. This study provides evidence on the source of the efficiency loss from staggered boards by pointing to its governance role in promoting more inefficient allocation of R&D capital. The managerial moral hazard effect of staggered boards disproportionately contributes to low firm performance in innovative firms.====One concern with interpreting the changes in board structure and long-term investment behavior is that governance provisions are not randomly assigned, thus bringing the issue of reverse causality. We employ the one to one propensity score matching using the nearest neighbor to deal with reverse causality concerns. We match our firms using corporate governance performance and firm performance variables with exact matching on country and industry levels. Our study results are robust to controlling for reverse causality arising from selection issues. However, we do not make a causal claim that we have fully addressed other possible endogeneity issues.====This paper makes important contributions to the growing literature on governnance provisions in various ways (Faleye, 2007; Hartzell et al., 2004; Bebchuk and Cohen, 2005; Chen et al., 2018; Gompers et al., 2003, Bebchuk et al., 2009; Cohen and Wang, 2013; Johnson et al., 2015; Cremers et al., 2017; Chemmanur and Tian, 2017). First, we show that changes in R&D investments around changes in board structure are consistent with the managerial entrenchment view of antitakeover provisions. We document that staggered boards promote managerial moral hazard. This negative impact of staggered boards on long term firm value is more pronounced when combined with a poison pill provision. Additionally, we provide evidence that the negative impact of antitakeover provisions especially staggered boards, varies with heterogenous firm characteristics.====Second, this study contributes to the growing literature examining corporate governance systems and economic performance. We employ a micro-level analysis at the firm-level and uncover the governance role of antitakeover provisions from its general effect on firm performance and uncover an economic mechanism on the differential effects of staggered boards on R&D responsiveness to investment opportunity sets. We show that governance provisions particularly staggered boards decrease the sensitivity of R&D investments to the investment opportunity sets, resulting to higher innovative inefficiency. In the same vein, we provide further evidence that shows that the managerial moral hazard effect of staggered boards disproportionately contributes to low firm performance in innovative firms.====Third, this paper is one of the first studies to study the subject of antitakeover provisions using a panel of firms in Asian countries. Most studies on the market for corporate control are concentrated on American and European firms. Given that most Asian countries are in the governance reform phase (Haniffa and Hudaib, 2006) and their capital markets are still growing; this study increases our understanding by providing a new perspective in a different institutional environment from America and Europe. Thus, this study has profound policy implications for policymakers and regulators, given the growing market for corporate control in Asia.====The rest of the study is organized as follows; Section 2 gives an overview of the governance provisions, Section 3 contains literature review and hypothesis development, Section 4 explains the sample data and study variables, Section 5 includes data analysis and interpretation.

Companies that are expanding their operations across borders may opt for international accounting standards to achieve comparability, whereas companies that issue equity on foreign stock exchanges may opt for local accounting practices to meet listing requirements.====International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) have been legally adopted since 2005 in more than 130 countries, to facilitate the harmonization and development of financial markets. In the European Union (EU), IFRS are mandatory for the consolidated accounts of listed entities; they are optional for non-listed firms (Brébisson and Alphonse, 2018). In the majority of EU member states, non-listed companies can opt to produce their consolidated financial statements in IFRS to satisfy either shareholders’ or creditors’ needs, following the IFRS Conceptual Framework (International Accounting Standards Board [IASB, 2010]). Literature that studies the consequences of mandatory IFRS adoption by listed firms highlights significant benefits for firms. It documents positive and significant capital market reactions to the implementation of IFRS, this reaction depending on the enforcement regime (Armstrong et al., 2010; Li, 2010; Byard et al., 2011; Brüggemann et al., 2013; De George et al., 2016).====However, literature remains relatively scarce with regard to privately held groups, highlighting for example an improvement in accounting quality for voluntary or early adopters, that is, entities that anticipate the application of future rules (Christensen et al., 2015).====In this study, we investigate private firms’ benefits when using IFRS. On the one hand, these standards may be required by investors, either for valuation purposes in the context of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) or private-equity issues. On the other hand, lenders may request these standards for contracting reasons (i.e., to provide debt).====Although literature has studied listed firms’ voluntarily anticipation of the mandatory use of IFRS, it is not clear about why non-listed entities might opt for IFRS. Accordingly, we focus on non-listed companies opting for IFRS in their financial reporting to explore the standards’ consequences on firms’ access to debt. Our intuition is that IFRS can help private firms to reduce their natural opacity, and thus increase the debt access. We examine debt ratios of privately held companies located in Europe from 2005–2018. Using a fixed effects regression on panel data, we show that levels of debt weight in capital structures increase when firms use IFRS instead of local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The results suggest that IFRS facilitate credit access for non-listed firms, especially firms in weak informational environments, and firms that are younger, smaller and less tangible, hence more opaque. Our results are robust to different specifications, as well as to the use of matching methodology.====This article contributes to existing literature on the impact of IFRS adoption on firms’ access to funds. In addition to the large amount of literature dedicated to the impact of IFRS adoption on capital markets, there is a growing stream of literature that seeks to understand the standards’ impacts on the credit market. Ball et al. (2008) claim that the selection of accounting standards is influenced more by credit market expectations than capital market expectations. Florou and Kosi (2015) study whether IFRS facilitate debt access to listed entities; they find that such entities are more likely to issue public debt than private debt. de Lima et al. (2018) also work on the credit market; they conclude that firms using IFRS have better access to debt, but they focus on Brazil, where IFRS are mandatory. By studying the credit market rather than the capital market, we add to the debate on the general impact of IFRS adoption. Moreover, debt financing is one of the major sources of funds for companies.====Our analysis also adds to the debate on firms’ motivations to change their accounting standards. Most accounting research assesses the impact of IFRS on firms’ communication and valuation, cost of capital, loan contracts, and relationships with investors, in a context of mandatory adoption (Wu and Zhang, 2014; Florou et al., 2017). We complement these insights by considering the case of private companies in Europe as a unique setting of non-mandated firms that opt for IFRS. These firms may be less constrained in terms of communication, because they have the freedom to publish their financial information in either local or international sets of accounts. By describing the benefits of using IFRS for private companies, we can improve understanding of the role of accounting standards and contribute to the debate on the objectives of financial information.====Finally, working on private entities adopting IFRS, we add to regulatory debates at both the European and national levels. After the adoption of IFRS by listed companies, the EU debated whether to adopt the IFRS for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and for other entities. The EU finally adopted the 34th Directive in 2013, establishing a list of common accounting principles to support the harmonization of local rules (André, 2017). However, non-listed companies can still choose whether to adopt the full IFRS set of standards. Therefore, the reasons for their choices must be clarified to provide accounting authorities at both at the European and national levels with a clear framework to design future accounting regulations.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews literature; Section 3 presents our hypothesis, data and methodology; Section 4 develops our results and our robustness tests while Section 5 concludes.",Why choosing IFRS?

Beyond theoretical modeling, this study goes a step further and provides empirical evidence on this issue, thanks to the study of a real change in Spanish ====. Spain applied the so-called English rule in 2011 in the administrative jurisdiction. This study explores whether plaintiffs were more or less successful when litigating against public administrations since then. After controlling for several other factors, it is shown that the new rule considerably increased plaintiffs’ win rate (while also reducing litigation). The paper also presents a theoretical model explaining that the English rule can increase the prevalence of judgments in favor of plaintiffs through two channels: the selection of cases brought before the courts by interested parties and the level of deference paid by courts to the decisions under review.","Judicial proceedings involve costs that are initially borne by the parties and the State (i.e., taxpayers). However, upon completion of the judicial proceedings, some of those costs can be redistributed according to certain ""fee-shifting rules."" Those that have attracted the most scientific attention are the English and American rules. Under the former, the winning party is entitled to have all its costs paid by the losing party (""loser-pays-all""). Under the latter, litigants pay their own costs.====There is a large number of theoretical studies on the effects of fee-shifting rules (e.g., Katz, 1987; Hylton, 1993; Gravelle, 1993; Polinsky and Rubinfeld, 1998; Farmer and Pecorino, 1999; Van Wijck and Van Velthoven, 2000; Cumming, 2001; Bauman and Friehe, 2012; Hyde and Williams, 2002; Echazu and Garoupa, 2012; De Mot, 2012; Chappe, 2012; Schwab et al., 2014; Carbonara et al., 2015; Dari-Mattiacci and Saraceno, 2020). These studies show that such rules may have a considerable impact on: (i) the resources that each litigant devotes to trying to win the lawsuit; (ii) the incentives to comply with the law; (iii) the decision to litigate or not to litigate, since the risk of having to pay the costs or the prospect of the counterpart being ordered to pay them obviously influences the expected utility of using the courts; (iv) the decision to put an end to a lawsuit (e.g., by means of settlement), for reasons analogous to those that have just been pointed out; and, therefore, (v) on the number and type of disputes brought before the courts (Katz and Sanchirico, 2012). However, no study has analyzed how fee-shifting rules might directly or indirectly alter the quality of judicial decision-making.====In contrast to the theoretical work mentioned, there are very few general empirical studies on this subject and very few that analyze the effects of actual legal changes. As a general empirical study, the OECD Civil Justice Project (Palumbo et al., 2013) conducted a survey to find out the extent of the different rules in the OECD countries in civil jurisdictions. The ""pure"" English rule has been adopted in 23% of the countries that responded to the survey. The ""pure"" American rule has been adopted by 7%. Another 7% enforce a ""halfway rule."" However, in most legal systems, both rules are often used depending on the case (for example, because the judge is free to choose). A simple correlation analysis found no relationship between the level of litigation and the applicable rule.====Along with this, there are also studies analyzing the effects of particular legal reforms in this area. It has been observed that the adoption of the English rule for medical malpractice litigation in Florida: (i) increased the number of claims dropped by plaintiffs, while decreasing both the number of settled claims and the number of litigated claims (Snyder and Hughes, 1990); and (ii) increased plaintiff success rates at trial, average jury awards, and out-of-court settlements (Hughes and Snyder, 1995). Fenn et al. (2017) have also shown how the adoption of ==== agreements and the extension of the English rule in the United Kingdom increased the costs of each procedure by an average of 25%. Helmers et al. (2020) found evidence that the introduction of a cap for fee awards to successful litigants in cases decided by the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court of England and Wales increased the number of suits filed in that court, while decreasing the win rate for small/medium enterprise plaintiffs. Moreover, litigation expenses by large enterprise plaintiffs dropped, and settlements involving small/medium enterprise plaintiffs increased.====This article aims to study how fee-shifting rules may impact plaintiff win rates at trial.==== On the one hand, it provides a theoretical reasoning on this issue. On the other hand, it provides empirical evidence, thanks to a real change in Spanish legislation. In order to do so, we compiled a rich database at the provincial level in Spain.====This study explores whether, as a result of the adoption of a version of the ""English rule"" in the Spanish administrative jurisdiction, plaintiffs were more or less successful than before when litigating against administrative authorities. Law 37/2011==== changed the fee-shifting rule to be used in first-instance proceedings carried out by Spanish administrative courts and passed an ""attenuated"" English rule. Before then, the losing party had to pay the litigation costs of the winning party if the former had litigated in bad faith or frivolously, which in fact was very rarely considered to have happened.==== After 2011, the party whose claims had been fully rejected must pay the litigation costs of the winning party, unless the relevant court considers that the case presented serious doubts regarding the facts or the law.==== In the preamble of the Law, no specific justification for this provision was offered, but it was stated that some of its measures were ""aimed at limiting the abusive use of judicial instances"" (""====""). It should also be noted that both before and after this legal change (which took place in 2011), Spanish administrative courts have full discretion to limit or not limit fee shifting, i.e., to determine the extent to which the winning party is entitled to recover its litigation costs. In fact, they often limit the amount of fee-shifting substantially.====The adoption of this attenuated English rule reduced litigation and judicial congestion in the Spanish administrative jurisdiction (Martinez-Matute and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2017).==== According to the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ, 2018), the clearance rate for administrative cases in Spain went from 101% in 2010 to 124% in 2012 (and has remained above 110% since then). This remarkable improvement is not observed in the average of the countries analyzed by the CEPEJ.====By way of a descriptive analysis, the raw data suggest that the adoption of the new fee-shifting rule (together with the adoption of court fees) raised the plaintiff success rates in a very considerable manner. Thus, although the number of judgments became significantly reduced, the total number of judgments upholding plaintiffs’ claims was more or less constant or even increased during the 2013–2015 period, as shown in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the first changes in the plaintiffs’ win rates were not the result of a cycle change in the Spanish economy as they occurred during the period of recession (which had already begun in 2008).====It is particularly striking that in 2015, the administrative courts issued the largest number of judgments in history that were favorable to plaintiffs, higher than those reached in previous years, despite the fact that the total number of judgments (upholding + dismissing plaintiffs’ claims) decreased considerably. No less striking is the fact that during the years 2016 and 2017, the percentage of judgments in favor of plaintiffs diminished again.====In Fig. 2, we present the win rate (the ratio of upholding judgments to the total number of judgments) in the administrative jurisdiction for the same period. We can observe that the ratio remained practically at the same level in the first part of the period, in levels around a 45%. By contrast, since 2012, the ratio increased significantly, up to a level of more than 50% from 2013 onwards and even reaching a maximum of 55% in 2015.====Our hypothesis is that the English rule increased the prevalence of judgments in favor of plaintiffs through two channels: (i) by changing the selection of cases brought before the courts by litigants; and (ii) by decreasing judicial congestion and, as a result of that, reducing the degree of deference paid by courts to the administrative decisions under review. In other words, the adoption of this rule not only altered the choices made by interested parties but also how judges resolved those cases. Our paper thus unveils an interesting virtue of the English rule that has been unnoticed in the law-and-economics literature so far, namely that it might improve the quality of judicial decision-making.====The rest of the article is organized as follows.

In this paper, we investigate what happens to the collection of ====To settle this question, we employ an empirical approach and use a firm-level survey of 2292 firms in seven European countries in 2009. We find that when the coverage of credit registries increases, banks invest less in long-term relationship with their clients. Hence, when public information is widely available, banks do collect less private information on borrowers. This substitution only holds for firms with public information. We investigate if this reduction in the collection of private information alters firms’ access to credit, and we do not find a negative effect. The results are robust to alternative specifications and robustness tests.","Banks fundamentally rely on information to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. They can secure this information in two ways: by sourcing it directly from the firm, or by obtaining it from public or private credit databases. It seems straightforward that if banks can access information from external sources, this might substitute to collecting the information from the borrowers themselves. However, banks can still have an interest in collecting information from the firm, since it gives them access to private information on borrowers, that cannot be easily shared or even recorded in credit databases. Banks can see the collection and retention of this private information as strategic, giving them an advantage compared to their competitors. In this paper, we analyse this dynamic. We look at what happens to the collection of private information, when banks have access to a broader scope of either public or private credit databases.====Private information (we will refer to it as soft information) is gathered through regular interactions between the bank and its clients, a technique known as relationship lending. The objective is to build a ==== with the client, that helps to secure private, non-recordable information, such as opinions, ideas, prospects. The key points are that this information is not available through credit databases, which provide public information (such as credit history, balance-sheet and income statements) and is more precise. The bank can then build on this information to better allocate credit. From this perspective, private information gives an informational advantage to the bank. However, the collection of private information is costly for the bank: it involves time and effort, without necessary the immediate associated rewards. The question we aim to answer in this paper is: what happens to the use of relationship lending when the bank can easily source public information on borrowers through a better credit registry coverage? Does the expansion of credit registries substitute to relationship lending, or is relationship lending still strategically used by the bank?====The literature suggests two opposite answers to that question. On the one hand, a higher level of creditor information available through credit registries may be associated with less relationship lending. Three reasons underlie this substitution effect. First, both credit registries and relationship lending reduce information asymmetries between the bank and the borrower and ease the access to credit (==== Petersen and Rajan, 1994; Cenni et al., 2015; Berger et al., 2017; Jappelli and Pagano, 2002; Barron and Staten, 2003; Kallberg and Udell, 2003). In short, they fulfil similar objectives and achieve similar outcomes. Second, putting in place a long-term relationship with borrowers is costly for banks (Berger and Udell, 2006). Accessing information on borrowers through public credit registries or private credit bureaus does not entail the same costs and so reduces the incentives of banks to invest in relationship lending. Third, the use of relationship lending exposes both the bank and the firm to potential negative effects. Firms can get trapped in the relationship and pay an excessive interest rate (Sharpe, 1990); conversely, the bank can maintain the relationship despite its own interest, because of the costs associated in building the relationship in the first place (Dewatripont and Maskin, 1995).==== Accessing public information through credit registries do not result in similar negative effects. Hence, banks might prefer to reduce the use of relationship lending in the context of high creditor information provided by credit registries.====On the other hand, banks have incentives to strategically invest in private information when public information becomes widely available. Karapetyan and Stacescu (2014) show that generalizing the access to borrowers’ public information (for example, through credit registries) increases the relative value of soft information (privately obtained through relationship lending). If all banks can have access to public information through credit registries, banks that invest in relationship lending will obtain valuable private information. Soft information then becomes a competitive advantage which motivates banks to invest in relationship lending (Schenone, 2010). In that case, an increase in creditor information provided by credit registries would be associated with greater use of relationship lending.====We investigate which effect prevails using the EU-EFIGE/Bruegel-UniCredit dataset (EFIGE dataset). This dataset provides firm-level answers to a survey conducted in 2010 in seven European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We select firms that used credit in 2009 and merge these data with the Amadeus database for financial information, for a sample of 2292 firms. The EFIGE dataset provides valuable information on the type of lending banks employ. We use the survey responses to construct an index of relationship lending. We measure creditor information available to banks using the quality and coverage of credit registries in each country. We then assess the role of information available through credit registries in the use of relationship lending.====We assess the impact of two types of credit registries: public credit registries and private credit bureaus (Pagano and Jappelli, 1993). Credit bureaus are private companies that sells information on borrowers – for instance, the CRIF in Italy. Alternatively, the state can put in place credit registries that collect and make publicly available information on borrowers – for instance the Risk Information Centre in Spain.==== Both mechanisms aim at collecting and disseminating information on borrowers.====We also investigate whether a decline in relationship lending would be associated with a reduced access to credit for viable borrowers (==== credit rationing, see Jaffee and Stiglitz, 1989). While banks may have an interest in reducing relationship lending when public information on borrowers is widely available, firms may or may not benefit from such a shift.====The main result of our study is that an increase in creditor information from credit registries is associated with a decrease in relationship lending. This result lends support to the view that both creditor registries and relationship lending achieve similar objectives for banks and show that the informational environment affects the collection of soft information by banks. This effect can be attributed to both private credit bureaus and public credit registries. We find no evidence that this change is associated with a reduced access to credit for firms; on the contrary, we provide evidence of a shift towards lending relying on hard information in countries with higher credit registry coverage.====We test the robustness of our results with six tests. First, we use two alternative indicators of creditor information to replace our key variables. Second, considering that our indicator on relationship lending is based on EFIGE survey responses and may depend on firms’ perceptions, especially after the financial crisis, we employ four other measures that have been used in existing literature. Third, we challenge our interpretation. If our interpretation is accurate, we should not observe a substitution effect for firm that do not convey enough hard information to be recorded in credit registries. We confirm this view, showing that the effect is opposite for these firms. Fourth, because the legal environment also determines bank credit (e.g., Djankov et al., 2008a) and may supplant the information effect (e.g., Cho et al., 2014), we control for the role of creditor rights and contracts’ enforcement. Fifth, we consider a potential endogeneity bias in creditor information: banks may increase the degree of creditor information in the economy (e.g., by setting up private bureaus) ==== they do not use relationship lending. We address this issue by performing an Instrumental Variable (IV) regression. We use banks’ historical membership in associations and agreement with memoranda that aim to foster the level of information in the country as instruments. Sixth, because creditor information reduces the use of relationship lending, some firms may be excluded from the credit market and may not appear in our sample. We therefore use the Heckman (1976) correction to control for a potential selection bias. Our results are robust to all these potential caveats.====Our study provides new evidence for both the lending technology and the creditor information literature streams. We contribute to the large literature stream that investigates the determinants and role of relationship lending (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 1994; Berger and Udell, 2002; Stein, 2002; Berger et al., 2005; Bolton et al., 2016). We notably show that the degree of creditor information in a country is an important determinant of relationship lending and that a higher level of creditor information substitutes for relationship lending, without generating a credit constraint for the firm. We also add new evidence on the legal environment literature in general (e.g., La Porta et al., 1998, 2006; McLean et al., 2012), its role in debt markets (e.g., Djankov et al., 2007; Qian and Strahan, 2007; Bae and Goyal, 2009), and the specific role of creditor information in bank debt (e.g., Pagano and Jappelli, 1993; Jappelli and Pagano, 2002; Brown et al., 2009; Vig, 2013; Cho et al., 2014).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

That assumption has been called into question by recent work that shows that, under the standard infinitely repeated game model of reputation, reputational ","For many years, most scholars have assumed that the strength of reputational incentives is positively correlated with firm size. The conventional wisdom was that firms that sell more products or services are more likely to be trustworthy than those that sell less because larger firms have more to lose if consumers decide they have behaved badly. This assumption helps explain why law and accounting firms can act as gatekeepers, why mass market products are more likely to be safe, why firms are less likely to exploit one-sided contracts than consumers, and why manufacturers market new products under the umbrella of established trademarks (Kraakman, 1984 p. 891, Coffee, 2006 p. 136, S. Choi, 1998b; Barnett, 2012; Polinsky and Shavell, 2010 p. 1491, Bebchuk and Posner, 2006 p. 832, but see Macey, 2013 Chapters 6 and 7).====Nevertheless, articles by Eric Rasmusen (2016) and Edward Iacobucci (2012) call into question the assumption of reputational economies of scale. They assert that, under the infinitely repeated game model of reputational enforcement, there is no advantage to firms that sell more. While firms that sell greater quantities have more to lose if they misbehave, they also have more to gain from misbehaving, and these two effects offset each other precisely. Instead, Rasmusen and Iacobucci assert that there are reputational economies of scale only under special circumstances, such as monopoly. Rasmusen and Iacobucci’s work is consistent with prior work that shows reputational economies of scale exist because those prior articles assume an infinite-horizon model in which sellers are able to price monopolistically (Robb and Fishman, 2005; Cai and Obara, 2009; Choi, 1998a; Wernerfelt, 1988).==== Rasmusen and Iacobucci’s work is also consistent with Dana and Spier (2018), which finds that a monopolistic multi-product firm facing a competitive fringe can induce better consumer monitoring of quality and thus increase both producer and consumer surplus by bundling. Dana and Spier (2018) shares a number of features with this paper, including the idea that, when low quality is detected with probability less than one, consumers can more effectively punish a multi-product firm thus making the firm’s commitment to quality more credible.====This article argues that reputational economies of scale exist under the infinitely repeated game model of reputation, even when there is competition and without other special conditions. The infinitely repeated game reputation model requires only minor adjustment in order to generate reputational economies of scale. The only modification necessary is to assume that low quality is detected with probability less than one and that the probability of detection is positively correlated with the quantity sold. This assumption is valid for nearly all situations to which reputational enforcement is usually applied. For example, if a manufacturer skimps on the safety of its products, the probability that any one product will cause an accident is likely to be less than one. Nevertheless, if the manufacturer sells many products, it is quite likely that there will be accidents. As it sells more low-quality products, there will be more accidents and more bad publicity, and consumers are more likely to choose to buy other products. Similarly, if an accounting firm is not rigorous in an audit of a single company in a single year, the probability that its lack of rigor will become known is less than one. Nevertheless, if an accounting firm is consistently sloppy in its audits of many companies, the low quality of its audits will eventually damage its reputation.====Rasmusen and Iacobucci’s argument against reputational economies of scale applies with almost equal force to finite-horizon models of reputation, such as the models developed by Kreps and Wilson (1982) and Milgrom and Roberts (1982). In fact, even with monopoly, there are no reputational economies of scale in simple-finite horizon models. Nevertheless, the same modification – that the probability of detection is positively correlated with the quantity sold – is also sufficient to generate reputational economies of scale in a finite horizon model of reputation when the firm sells high quality in all but the last period.====Section 2 briefly sets out the point made by Rasmusen (2016) and Iacobucci (2012) that, under the basic infinitely repeated game model of reputation, there are no reputational economies of scale. Section 3 modifies the basic model by assuming that the probability of detection is less than one. It shows that the minimum quality-assuring price decreases with the volume of sales. Section 4 analyzes the umbrella branding context and shows that a firm that uses the same trademark for two products can credibly commit to high quality at a lower price. Section 5 analyzes reputational economies of scale under a finite horizon model with two types. Section 6 discusses caveats, extensions, and possible reputational diseconomies of scale, and Section 7 concludes.",Reputational economies of scale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301782,20 November 2020,2020,Research Article,100.0

Squeeze-out procedures can overcome this free-riding dilemma by allowing a buyer to enforce a payout of minority shareholders and seize complete control of the target firm. However, it is often argued that shareholder litigation restores the free-riding dilemma. Applying a sequential takeover game, we examine the two standard legal remedies of shareholders, the ‘action of avoidance’ and the judicial ‘price fairness review’ and demonstrate that it is not shareholder litigation that brings back the free-riding dilemma, but rather the strategic gambling of buyers for lower prices and flaws in the design and application of squeeze-out laws. We also analyze a favorable change in jurisdiction of the German Federal Court and provide implications for legal policy.","It is commonly accepted that takeovers of firms play a crucial role in the economy. Given effective competition, successful takeovers accelerate the restructuring and rightsizing of formerly weak and cost inefficient firms. Through the acquisition, buyers are able to realize synergies in production and economies of scope and scale. Furthermore, takeovers often lead to the replacement of the previous management, and this ideally favors change and a quicker adjustment to the market situation (see, among others, Yarrow, 1985; Scherer, 1988; Holmström and Nalebuff, 1992).====Many large firms in the various industries of today's economies can be regarded as widely held corporations==== (see, e.g., Porta et al., 1998; Faccio and Lang, 2002, and Rubin, 2007), and a successful takeover often requires that a public bid from a corporate buyer is accepted by the firm's shareholders.==== It is well known that this takeover bid mechanism is prone to a free-riding dilemma among shareholders: “any profit a raider can make from the price appreciation of shares he purchases represents a profit shareholders could have made if they had not tendered their shares to the raider” (Grossman and Hart, 1980==== p. 43). As efficiency enhancing takeovers eventually lead to a higher firm value and thus higher share prices, holding out and keeping the shares will enable minority shareholders to freeride on the buyer's effort and participate in these takeover gains. Thus, shareholders will reject a public bid from the buyer when they expect the takeover to be successful and value improving. As a consequence, such free-riding behavior potentially impedes the takeover as the buyer may not collect enough shares to assume control of the target.====In order to facilitate takeovers, so-called squeeze-out procedures have become increasingly relevant for corporate buyers in many jurisdictions (e.g., United States Delaware law, European Directive 2004/25/EC, German § 327a-327f AktG). In principle, a squeeze-out==== entitles a buyer who has collected the majority of a company’s shares and who meets a required minimum fraction of ownership (the ‘squeeze-out threshold’) to forcibly pay out all the minority shareholders and assume full ownership of the company.==== As a consequence, in a tender offer for control, shareholders can no longer expect to participate in the anticipated appreciation of the share price by rejecting the bid. Squeeze-out procedures thus basically eliminate the free-riding problem (see Yarrow, 1985).====However, such squeeze-outs also enable the buyer to seize the complete gains of the takeover and force shareholders out of their investments. Most countries thus enacted specific shareholder protection laws. Standard legal remedies for shareholders include the ‘====, which contests the legitimacy of the squeeze-out itself, and ‘====’-procedures where the payout price is reviewed by the court. In the end, a court ruling can hinder or delay the squeeze-out and change the distribution of takeover gains between the buyer and the shareholders. Several scholars claim that such shareholder litigation effectively restores the free-riding problem and thus frustrates the underlying incentive mechanism of squeeze-out procedures (see, e.g., Mueller and Panunzi, 2004 and Burkart and Lee, 2018).====In this paper we focus on tender offers that are followed by a squeeze-out (i.e., ‘two-step’ tender offers), and examine the effects of costly shareholder litigation on the success of such takeovers. We show that shareholder protection rights and litigation induce a redistribution of takeover gains, as intended by legislators in the United States and Europe, and do not impede efficient takeovers or sizeable rents for the acquirer per se. In the following, we stylize the takeover bid mechanism as a sequential game between a corporate buyer and atomistic shareholders. In this theoretical setting, all takeovers are value improving and individual shareholders may either accept the offered price by the buyer and tender their shares, or reject it. If sufficient shares are collected in the tender phase, the buyer may announce squeeze-out procedures and, in exchange for a compensation payment, force all remaining shareholders out of the target. Shareholders may, however, move to court and seek a review of the fairness of the compensation payment by the judge. A buyer thus has to form rational expectations about the later value of litigation to shareholders, i.e. about their reservation price. In order to accomplish the takeover and eliminate any free-riding incentive, he then makes a profit-maximizing tender offer that equals this reservation price.====We find that, despite the risk of shareholder litigation, a buyer is basically able to make a tender offer at a price below the expected post-takeover share value and achieve a successful takeover. The judicial ‘====’, however, compels buyers to offer higher prices to incentivize tendering and thus avoid the free-riding problem. Low costs of shareholder litigation, brief court procedures and a low discount rate work in favor of litigating shareholders. As a consequence, the required payments to eliminate free-riding increase, and it becomes costlier for the buyer to achieve a certain takeover. Our analysis shows that the free-riding dilemma in the takeover bid mechanism only re-emerges when buyers try to reduce takeover costs by using lower-than-optimal bids, when dual legal thresholds for corporate control and squeeze-outs are in place, and when the judicial price review focuses on share price fluctuations after the buyer made his public bid.====More broadly, we demonstrate that it is not shareholder litigation that restores the observed free-riding dilemma, but the strategic gambling of buyers for lower prices and flaws in the design of squeeze-out laws and judicial review. This finding applies to the two standard legal remedies of shareholders, the ‘====’ and the judicial ‘====’.==== Previous research by Mueller and Panunzi (2004) and Burkart and Lee (2018) does not consider shareholders’ litigation cost and shareholders’ time preferences. They also do not take into account that, in practice, most court proceedings are ended by settlement. Our results corroborate the detrimental effect of separate legal thresholds for corporate control and squeeze-outs shown by Gomes (2012) and Dalkir et al. (2018).====The paper is organized as follows: chapter 2 provides an overview of the related literature and chapter 3 introduces the institutional background. Chapter 4 describes the stylized takeover game and derives first theoretic results. We then apply our model to a major change in the German jurisdiction on squeeze-outs in chapter 5.

(2014) provide evidence of a structural break in 2008 in yield spreads of government bonds issued by member states of the European Monetary Union (EMU). Ludwig (2014) detects some regime shifts with divergent sovereign bond yields in 2010 for Ireland, Greece and Portugal. Gruppe and Lange (2014) identify a break in the convergence between German and Spanish government bond yields, which could be interpreted as a shift in market perception of sovereign credit risk in Spain. In the case of Greece, Katsimi and Moutos (2010) point out the relation between government debt and current account deficits and explain that a growing share of Greece’s public debt is held by non-residents, which makes the country vulnerable to changes in foreign investors’ perception of risk. Gómez-Puig and Sosvilla-Rivero (2013) investigate contagion effects and find that the causal relationships between sovereign debt yields in peripheral EMU countries increased significantly during the sovereign debt crisis. Gruppe et al. (2017) emphasize the role of redenomination risk in the divergence between national government bond yields during the sovereign debt crisis. This risk is related to the possibility that a country leaves the EMU and introduces a depreciating national currency. Such a country has to face increased risk premia and government bond yields due to both types of risk, sovereign credit risk and redenomination risk. Hence, it is of prime importance to think about options to cope with risks of EMU exit.====Moreover, borrowing costs increased much not only for the public sector but also for the private sector of distressed countries. A deep recession ensued with dire financial and economic consequences for the EMU countries that were most affected by the sovereign debt crisis. Neri and Ropele (2015) provide evidence of the marked deterioration in the cost and availability of credit for the private sector in these countries, which had significant negative effects on economic activity. Moro (2014) discusses some developments in financial markets, among which the mispricing of sovereign risk by capital markets and the severe funding problems for businesses and households following the tensions in sovereign debt markets and banking sectors. The problem of mispricing is well-documented in the case of Greece, in particular by Gibson et al. (2014). In the case of Italy, Albertazzi et al. (2014) find that tensions on the sovereign debt market affected the cost of credit for businesses and households. For Ireland, Whelan (2014) explains that despite a strong fiscal position and a low level of government debt before the global financial crisis, sovereign bond yields rose in 2010 because the government had guaranteed the liabilities of Irish banks. By contrast, in Portugal, the increase in sovereign credit risk affected the capacity of banks to get access to liquidity in the eurozone interbank market (Sérgio and de Sousa, 2016).====In the end, financial assistance was provided to distressed countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain) to avoid sovereign default, increased contagion effects and ultimately a collapse of the EMU. Financial support took various forms, among which conditional loans by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and bond purchases through Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) by the European Central Bank (ECB).====Member states of the European Union (EU) disagreed about appropriate policy responses, and in particular about the interpretation of EU law. The Treaty of Lisbon (former Treaty of Maastricht) forbids joint liability of sovereign borrowers, that is a member state cannot take on the liabilities of another member state (Article 125 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU - TFEU). A strict enforcement of this “no bail-out” clause was not endorsed by all member states. It is in this context that proposals for the creation of sovereign Eurobonds started to emerge.==== Since 2010, the idea of pooling sovereign debt instruments has been met with enthusiasm in some member states (e.g. France, Italy) and skepticism in some others (e.g. Germany, Netherlands). The latter mostly fear that the existence of Eurobonds would impair commitment to fiscal discipline and are reluctant to assume the debt of spendthrift governments.====The severe economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic has brought back the idea of Eurobonds to the fore. Indeed, in March 2020, leaders from nine EU countries asked for the creation of a common debt instrument to finance national policies required to contain the virus and mitigate the economic consequences.==== Eurobonds (or “coronabonds”) would complement the broad set of actions taken by the ECB and the European Commission in response to the Covid-19 crisis. Leaders from other EU countries did not endorse the proposal. Disagreements between member states over the idea of Eurobonds have certainly not disappeared. In late July, the EU summit clearly showed deep divisions between member states on the features of the recovery fund (750 billion euros), with a strong opposition from some member states (Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark in particular). EU leaders ultimately agreed to authorize the European Commission to borrow funds on the capital markets and use them for loans (€ 360 billion) and grants (€ 390 billion). The Commission will sell bonds on behalf of the EU and use own resources of the EU budget for repayment. These new powers are to be limited in size, duration and scope. While the deal does not represent sovereign debt mutualization, it can be considered as a first step towards Eurobonds, albeit small. It also reveals that sharing the debt burden is a matter of much concern for countries with strong fiscal positions.====In this paper, we are interested in studying the implications of Eurobonds in terms of fiscal policy.==== What would happen if a member state, say Greece, began to increase government spending and issue Eurobonds? Would fiscal policy in this country be more effective? What would be the consequences for other member states, among them Germany? Would cross-border spillover effects on output really be negative?====There is certainly political disagreement between member states in the matter of Eurobonds. Yet, academic research has provided some strong arguments in support of joint liability in sovereign borrowing (Basu and Stiglitz, 2015; Tirole, 2015; Baglioni and Cherubini, 2016; Basu, 2016; Favero and Missale, 2016), albeit with some reservations (Beetsma and Mavromatis, 2014; Esteves and Tunçer, 2016; Hatchondo et al., 2017).==== So, what is it all about?====A sovereign Eurobond is a debt instrument that would be issued and backed by all eurozone countries. It would enable member states to borrow funds. It can be seen as a form of debt mutualization inasmuch as member states would collectively guarantee repayments. The nationality of the sovereign issuer would not be known. Hence, interest rates on Eurobonds would be the same whatever the sovereign issuer. The risk premium, in principle, would depend on the average level of sovereign debt in the Eurozone and on the perception of financial market participants upon the credibility of the joint guarantee of repayment.====The main advantage of Eurobonds would be the existence of a large and liquid market for sovereign bonds. The most indebted member states would benefit from a decrease in borrowing costs because they would no longer issue debt with a country-specific risk premium. In addition, as long as changing risk perceptions among financial market participants play a significant role in sovereign spreads, the creation of Eurobonds could protect heavily indebted member states against contagion effects during financial turmoil, and this would benefit fiscally responsible member states as well (Favero and Missale, 2012). It could also prevent debt dynamics from getting into (or staying in) an unsustainable path (Tielens et al., 2014). This outcome holds if moral hazard does not prevail though.====Moral hazard is a critical issue. Sovereign Eurobonds could raise some incentive problems in terms of fiscal discipline because higher public deficits would no longer be bound to be sanctioned by higher borrowing costs.==== Furthermore, if some governments were to become profligate, this could be costly for the least indebted member states (and particularly for those which enjoy a triple A credit rating). The latter would face a higher public borrowing cost if the average eurozone sovereign risk premium were higher than theirs. They could even incur welfare losses in some cases of policy coordination and cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities (Engwerda et al., 2019).====Some solutions to the problem of moral hazard have been put forward in the literature about joint liability in the context of sovereign debt. A third party could impose costs if a sovereign borrower reneges on its commitments (Basu and Stiglitz, 2015), but sanctions should be feasible (Tirole, 2015). A debt management agency could issue insurance bonds with country-specific risk premia that would be based on national economic fundamentals (Muellbauer, 2013). Eurobonds could be used to finance projects that benefit all member states (Favero and Missale, 2016) or they should cover only a fraction of government debt (Baglioni and Cherubini, 2016).====In this respect, Delpla and von Weizsäcker (2010) made a “Blue Bond proposal” to pool only a share of public debts. Each member state would be allowed to issue Eurobonds (“blue bonds”), but up to a limit corresponding to 60 percent of its GDP (the Maastricht criterion). Blue bonds could be issued with low interest rates, because all member states would collectively guarantee the repayment. Furthermore, they would be senior debt, that would protect creditors from defaults by giving them a preferred status in sovereign debt repayments.==== Any member state that would need to borrow more than 60 percent of its GDP would have to issue its own bonds (“red bonds”). The latter would be junior debt that would be honored only after the senior debt has entirely been serviced. Red bonds would not be guaranteed by other member states, and as a result, they would likely be issued with higher interest rates. Furthermore, they would not be eligible for the refinancing operations of the ECB.====There are, however, downsides. Esteves and Tunçer (2016) studied five experiences that they consider as being early forms of debt mutualization in the pre-1914 period. The first case ended up with a default of Greece, and the loan was ultimately paid by the guarantors (Britain, France, Russia). The other cases were implemented with some international financial control and/or some write-downs of existing debt. Moreover, Hatchondo et al. (2017) show that if non-defaultable debt (Eurobonds) and defaultable debt (national bonds) coexist, the decrease in the interest rate spread is short-lived, because the government still has to issue defaultable debt. In other respects, Beetsma and Mavromatis (2014) demonstrate that the guarantee of repayment by other countries should not be 100 % and should be sufficiently low to incite a government not to put into more debt than if it had no guarantee at all. However, Badarau et al. (2016) argue that if the joint guarantee of repayment is not full, the institutional framework of Eurobonds might lack credibility, and, as a consequence, macroeconomic outcomes might not be favorable.====Last but not least, there are some legal questions about the introduction of Eurobonds that must be tackled. Article 122 TFEU allows for financial assistance when “a member state is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control”. Eurobonds are a form of financial assistance. Do they necessitate legal reforms? Matziorinis (2012) argues that a revision of the EU Treaty or the adoption of a new EU Treaty is required to obtain the full support of member states for some institutional changes such as: a unified public accounts system, a Treasury board to supervise public borrowing, more binding rules in the Stability and Growth Pact, and a debt agency to manage the issuance of common sovereign bonds. This could be difficult to do because a revision of the Treaty must rely on a unanimous decision. An alternative could be an agreement reached by a subset of member states through “enhanced cooperation”. But this procedure to establish deeper integration must involve a minimum of nine member states.====In fact, Claessens et al. (2012) note that the need for legal reforms depends on the specific features of the proposals. For instance, Delpla and von Weizsäcker (2010) consider that their Blue Bond proposal is compatible with the EU Treaty because EU countries would not pool the entirety of their public debt under jointly guaranteed debt. In addition, an Independent Stability Council would be in charge of the annual allocation of Blue Bonds, and this allocation would be voted on by the national parliaments of all participating countries.====In this paper, we consider two main proposals for Eurobonds – full and partial joint liability – and analyze their macroeconomic implications in an asymmetric monetary union. We build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to describe a monetary union composed of two countries with different size and different fiscal policy preferences. We study the effects of a positive country-specific public spending shock to investigate what would happen if one government were no longer fiscally responsible in a monetary union with sovereign risk pooling. To do so, we compare three scenarios of government debt issuance. In the baseline scenario with national bonds only, each country issues its own sovereign bonds with country-specific risk premia. There is no risk pooling, and the risk premium paid by each government to borrow funds in the bond market depends on the level of its sovereign debt. In the scenario with Eurobonds, by contrast, there is full risk pooling and both countries share a common risk premium which depends positively on the level of total debt at the union level. In the third scenario, there is a cap on the issuance of Eurobonds up to 60 percent of GDP in each country. Beyond this limit, countries must issue national bonds with their own individual risk premia. This last scenario corresponds to the proposal of Delpla and von Weizsäcker (2010). There is only partial pooling so that joint liability is limited. This scenario is labelled “Limited Eurobonds”. It is important to note that in this scenario, Eurobonds are assumed to be risk-free debt instruments because of their special features (“blue bonds”): issuance cap, seniority and eligibility for the refinancing operations of the central bank.====Assuming that a country decides to increase public spending and cares little about debt stabilization, we find that its spending multiplier would be the highest with Eurobonds and the lowest with Limited Eurobonds. The spillover effects on output in the rest of the union would be negative with Eurobonds but positive with Limited Eurobonds. In this respect, our findings support the proposal of Delpla and von Weizsäcker (2010) for limited joint liability.====In the literature, Badarau et al. (2016) also provide similar results in a DSGE model of a monetary union, but they do not consider differences in country size between member countries. Yet, this feature is at the heart of the recent debate about Eurobonds in the Eurozone. Here, we propose a generalization of their model by introducing an adjustable size parameter. This extension allows for a more realistic analysis of Eurobonds and a better consideration of structural heterogeneity in the Eurozone. Three novelties are to be noted.====First, we introduce imported goods in government consumption. This assumption is based on the observation that, according to EU law, public procurements must be open to competition between businesses of all member states. Admittedly, this assumption makes the cross-border spillover effects of an increase in government consumption more likely to be positive (see Blanchard et al., 2016). However, to keep the model analytically tractable, we refrain from incorporating usual assumptions in the model, which would make spillover effects positive, such as habit persistence or liquidity-constrained households (as in Naraidoo et al., 2017). We do not describe explicitly the role of financial intermediaries either. It follows that our model does not account for the impact of sovereign risk on the cost of borrowing for firms (see Corsetti et al., 2013; Badarau et al., 2014), but it allows for an impact of sovereign risk on the expected return of household portfolios. So instead, we put special emphasis on the definition of government budget constraints and debt issuance in the three scenarios under consideration.====Second, we consider that changes in governments’ behavior may occur because of changes in the regime of debt financing. A government may not care about debt stabilization as much as it used to if the cost of borrowing is no longer dependent on the level of its own debt alone. In particular, the response of public spending to government debt in the fiscal policy rule, which in principle is needed to stabilize debt, is assumed to be lower in the spendthrift country once Eurobonds are implemented.====Third, we check the sensitivity of our results to heterogeneity across countries with regard not only to policy preferences but also to country size. In particular, we look at cases where public spending is procyclical in the spendthrift country and counter-cyclical in the rest of the union. We also explore the case where this country is a small country and explain the implications in terms of spending multiplier and spillover effects. Additionally, we examine various monetary policy rules.====In the end, we carry out a welfare analysis to compare outcomes under the three scenarios of government debt issuance in which countries differ in size.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model by paying special attention to the determinants of government debt issuance and sovereign risk premia in each scenario. Section 3 outlines the calibration of the model. Section 4 explains the results of the simulations of a country-specific public spending shock under the three scenarios. Section 5 provides the sensitivity analysis. Section 6 concludes.",Macroeconomic and policy implications of eurobonds,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301678,2 November 2020,2020,Research Article,102.0

Following the suggestions of several international organizations, most countries have tried to speed up their case resolution systems by streamlining judicial procedure. However, not as much attention has been devoted to test the potential drawbacks of similar reforms in terms of supplying a quicker but yet qualitatively inferior justice, thus contradicting the well-known legal maxim ","In the last two decades, the legal maxim, ==== has been at the center of domestic and international policies agendas all around the world, especially for its economic consequences. If economic theory has always assumed property rights to be smoothly enforced by courts (Botero et al., 2003, North, 2005), nowadays it is quite obvious that even an efficient rule will at best operate ineffectively if not properly enforced (Marciano et al., 2019). Given the incomplete nature of the contracts that regulate business transactions (Grossman and Hart, 1986), trading partners encourage reciprocal investments by establishing long-term business relations. Nonetheless, such investments might be interpreted as sunk costs, incentivizing opportunistic behaviors. If contractual obligations are not respected, thus capturing trading rents, ==== suppliers will try to leverage their monopoly power and impose higher prices.====It is thus clear that the only way to solve this problem is for judiciaries to limit such opportunistic behaviors. Each time a case is brought to court, uncertainty arises with regards to the legal issues hereby litigated (Williamson, 1985). As a consequence, a fast judiciary acts as a fundamental deterrent against economic agents’ willingness to deviate from previously signed contracts. By solving legal disputes, judges produce a “judge-made” legal certainty, limiting the negative externalities deriving from opportunism. By decreasing uncertainty and making contractual obligations more likely to be performed, a functioning judiciary contributes to encourage investments and ultimately economic development.====Within this theoretical framework, international organization starting with the World Bank's Doing Business program (World Bank, 2016) and the seminal work by Djankov et al. (2003), but also the OECD (Palumbo et al., 2013) and its European counterparts (CEPEJ, 2014) have devoted a lot of attention to the measurement of courts’ performance and the ways to improve it. Similar policy orientations have been supported by an equally vibrant scholarly literature that has tried to empirically estimate the positive effect of a well-functioning judiciary and a fast litigation system for economic development (Visaria, 2009, Chemin, 2009, Chemin, 2012, Ippoliti et al., 2015, Mora-Sanguinetti et al., 2017, Mruk et al., 2019, Melcarne and Ramello, 2020, Liu et al., 2020, Cepec and Grajzl, 2020).====Nonetheless, these studies mostly concentrate their attention to estimate the estimation of a causal impact of judicial performance on some socio-economic outcome, usually exploiting some exogenous variation in courts’ delay. Accordingly, not much as been said about what are the true determinants of courts’ performances. Early literature (Buscaglia and Ulen, 1997, Botero et al., 2003, Djankov et al., 2003) claimed procedural formalism to be the most relevant driver favoring the speeding up of legal cases’ resolution. As said above, these results have then vastly inspired the policy suggestions of international organizations like the World Bank: a less formalized procedure would allow courts to deliberate faster, thus ultimately supporting economic activity.====Similar positions have attracted many criticisms mainly suggesting that a faster judiciary does not necessarily imply a better justice and that improving quantitative indicators might come at the cost of an overall deterioration in the quality of the judiciary's work. In order to empirically test the hypothesis that justice delayed is actually justice denied, one must first discuss whether the performance of judiciaries (in its quantitative dimension) is in somewhat contrast with the overall quality of the “justice” delivered by courts. In other words, is there a ==== between timeliness and quality of justice?====Regardless of the specific quantitative dimension of judicial performance taken into consideration (delay, productivity, clearance rate or technical efficiency), the emphasis always lays on aspects such as the number of cases solved with given resources or the timeliness of their disposition. Nothing is said about “how” such cases are dealt: are cases solved correctly? Is legal truth ascertained via judicial decisions? Is the Rule of Law respected? One might thus suggest that judicial performance and the quality of justice might not necessarily correlate positively.====Marciano et al. (2019) have discussed several potential reasons that could motivate the existence of a trade-off between quality and timeliness. The main point derives from the fact that measures of judicial performance as delay do not carry much information about the qualitative dimension of judges’ work and thus the way the law is actually enforced. Accordingly, a well-performing judiciary that is able to enforce contracts in a timely way, could at the same time imply systematic violations of the rule of law, thus turning into a sort of “extractive” institution (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012). Another theoretical motivation for a negative correlation between quality and judicial delay derives from the fact that a qualitatively good legal enforcement should make the judiciary more bound to the legal framework and thus, potentially, slower and less effective. While a theoretically ideal court should be able to solve cases almost instantly Djankov et al. (2003), physical and procedural constraints necessarily slow the work of judges. Accordingly, one might say that if reducing judicial delay is beneficial for the economy, making justice needs time and thus reduction of delay (better quantitative performance) might come at the cost of worsening the quality of justice, thus contradicting the aforementioned legal maxim.====Preliminary evidence seems to confute the existence of a trade-off between quality and timeliness (Buscaglia and Ulen, 1997, Djankov et al., 2003, Rosales-López, 2008, Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2012, Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2016, Melcarne and Ramello, 2015). The correlation between judicial performance and quality of justice seems to be positive, suggesting that countries with fast judiciaries are also the ones granting a good quality of justice. Nonetheless, more recent works (Marciano et al., 2019) suggest that once controlling for factors that could interplay with these measures, such correlation, despite remaining positive, looses all its statistical significance. As Posner (1998) claims, we might have some sort of ==== dilemma: a country without an established “justice” might not have the means to afford a fast judiciary, but without timely decisions, no country can afford to deliver fair justice. If causality was to run in the opposite direction as the legal maxim states, this would significantly undermine the impact of the policy suggestions made by the aforementioned international bodies.====Building on these preliminary findings, the main contribution of this work is to try to advance some further claims on the relationship between judicial performance and the quality of justice. Well aware of the difficulty of assessing causal relationships among institutional variables as correctly suggested by Klick (2010) and Helland (2016), we propose some alternative methodologies, highlighting their pros and cons, that might better approach the “ideal” first best result of isolating a causal impact of courts’ delay on the quality of justice and thus try to empirically test the famous legal maxim: ====. Employing a new way of instrumenting judicial delay and a panel vector autoregression approach, we find statistical significant results confirming the strong positive relationship between judicial performance and the quality of justice. Despite statistical tests seem to support the validity or our approach, given the limits of this kind of research, we remain though cautious when interpreting our estimates as causal inference, hoping future literature might build upon our results to further advance this stream of institutional empirical analysis.====The remainder of the work is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the two identification strategies we wish to employ in our empirical analysis, namely the instrumental variable (Section 2.1) and the panel-vector autoregression approaches (Section 2.2). In Section 3 we describe the data used in our econometric analysis, while in Section 4 we discuss the estimates thus obtained.

A set of ,"In 2016 the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) published the document “Mesurer la qualité de la justice”.==== According to this publication, the quality of justice is a concept hard to define, due the complex nature of the judicial institutions and the existing differences in the legal institutions across the nations. Then, they propose a model covering three levels namely (1) process/decisions, (2) performance, and (3) users’ perception. While the level “process/decisions” is related to the quality of judicial decisions, the level “performance” has to do with the accessibility, equity, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency of the Judicial System; and finally, the level named “users’ perceptions”, includes the degree of satisfaction expressed by users.====In this paper, we are interested in focusing on the so-called ====. The first question arising is how to measure the quality of judicial decisions? According to Basabe-Serrano (2016) there is no consensus on an empirically observable definition of the quality of judicial decisions. Nevertheless, in the Law and Economics tradition prevails the arguments provided by Shavell (1995) on the appeal process as a means of error correction. As the author argued in his article, “the appeals process allows society to harness information that litigant have about erroneous decisions and thereby to reduce the incidence of mistake at low cost.”==== Following Shavell (1995) arguments, in a broad sense, we can consider that the quality of a decision made by a judge at a lower court could be assessed by the decision of a higher court.====However, there still remains the question on how to empirically measure the quality of judicial decisions. As we will discuss in Section 2, there is a growing literature focusing on judges’ performance, where authors have assessed the quality of judicial output mostly proxied by the reversal rates or the number of citations per judge.====In our opinion, the relevant issue to be addressed is not only how to measure the quality of judicial decisions, but also to study the variables determining it. In his influential article “is the Ninth Circuit too large? A Statistical Study of Judicial Quality”, Posner (2000) analysed the effect of an increasing number of judgeship on the quality of judicial decisions, considering the reversals made by the Supreme Court as a proxy for quality. His results shown that “adding judgeships tend to reduce the quality of a court’s output”.====Following Posner (2000), we are interested in conducting an empirical study to determine the impact of the number of judges acting in a court on the quality of judicial decisions.==== Moreover, using the approach of Martín-Román et al. (2013) and Malo (2018), we will measure the effect of the type of judge, professional or non-professional, on the quality of court’s output.==== To achieve these objectives, a set of econometric models will be estimated in order to explain the differences existing in the quality of the sentences of the 339 Spanish Labour Courts taken as a sample, over the period 2004–2017.==== The acting of other judges in the court, besides the incumbent judge, will be considered as a treatment. In addition, different control covariates as economic determinants and other factors closely related to judicial activity will be empirically analysed, taking into account possible endogeneity problems in the treatment variable. As we will discuss in Section 6, our results show that the quality of judicial decisions decreases when other judges besides the incumbent judge are acting in the court, but this effect is smaller when the other judges acting in the court are non-professional judges.====This article aims to contribute to the literature on the Economics of Court Performance, particularly on the empirical analysis of the quality of judicial decisions, and it also looks to provide relevant suggestions for judicial policy making.====The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we briefly present a literature review. In section 3 we describe the functioning of the Labour Court Jurisdiction in Spain and its main indicators, while the judicial career in Spain is outlined in Section 4. The sample and descriptive statistics are presented in Section 5. The empirical strategy is offered in Section 6, where we also discuss the empirical results.

Under complete information, a fixed-rent contract is hypothesized to be the optimal institutional arrangement. Conversely, a share contract is found to be the best choice under incomplete information. Assuming that contracts between lessors and tenants from the same village operate under complete information and that contracts with tenants from outside the village operate under incomplete information, the empirical results confirm both hypotheses by showing that lessors with incomplete information have a lower probability of choosing a fixed-rent contract compared to lessors with complete information.","Agricultural land leasing is prevalent around the world in both developing and developed nations. This prevalence has been documented by numerous authors including Das et al. (2019), Katchova and Ahearn (2016), and Barry et al. (2003). For example, Katchova and Ahearn (2016) report that, on average, 40% of a U.S. farm’s land operation based is rented. There is even farmland leasing in countries where private ownership of farmland is banned (like China), but tenure of contract rights (which includes leasing) is allowed over a 30-year period (Li et al., 2018). In China, leasing of farmland is increasing due to an aging farmer population and migration of labor to urban areas (Zou et al., 2018).====One continuing controversy in leasing is share versus fixed-rent contracts. Under a fixed-rent contract, the tenant chooses how much farmland to lease and claims all of the residual income above the fixed rental payment. Under share contract, however, the land lessor and the tenant mutually claim the residual income. Share contracts (or sharecropping) are defined as an arrangement between two or more individual parties combining resources to produce certain mutually agreed outputs (Cheung, 1968). The actual outputs are to be shared according to an agreed upon percentage of the output.====The prevailing impression is that sharecropping in agriculture results in an inefficient allocation of resources, called Marshallian inefficiency. However, as illustrated by Cheung (1968), the implied resource allocation under private property rights in a free market is the same whether the land owner engages in farming, leases land on a fixed-rent basis, or leases with a share contract. His result is that a share contract is an efficient resource allocation under the condition of zero transaction costs. Johnson (1950) and Cheung (1968) have argued that, if the tenant’s work-effort could be monitored without cost and enforced by land lessor under complete information circumstances, then resource allocation under share tenancy could be as efficient as under fixed-rent tenancy. The requirement of complete information, however, has been criticized as being unrealistic (Stiglitz, 1974). Barry et al. (2003) show that equitable leasing arrangements consist of a hybrid of fixed and share elements based upon land productivity, resource costs, and cost structures.====Either type of contract can achieve an efficient resource allocation where information is complete. To the extent that information is incomplete, it is difficult for a land lessor to monitor a tenant at work at various farm tasks throughout the growing season in a dispersed and ecologically diverse agricultural environment. Therefore, transaction costs associated with the contractual enforceability may become so high that the fixed-rent contract needs to be replaced by a share contract in order to save the cost of measuring tenants’ work-effort when information between individuals is incomplete.====A prolific literature on land tenancy has focused on the choice between share and fixed-rent tenancy contracts. Both theoretical and empirical research on farmland leasing have focused on tenants in this contractual relationship. Theoretical models have been developed by Shetty (1988) and Laffont and Matoussi (1995). A risk sharing and moral hazard model was developed by Stiglitz (1974). Applied research using observations of tenants has found that liquidity constraints and more exposure to risk led tenants towards share contracts (Das et al., 2019). Laffont and Matoussi (1995) found that higher levels of liquidity among tenant farmers in terms of working capital increased the likelihood of fixed-rent contract.====This article combines theoretical models with empirical analyses of farmland lease contracts from the perspective of land lessors relative to the motivations of the tenant. The theoretical part derives implications which explore farmland lease contractual choice under two different information structures. The first relates to complete information, under which it is found that land lessor prefers a fixed-rent contract as the optimal institutional arrangement. The second involves incomplete information between the tenant and land lessor where a share contract is found to be the optimal choice for land lessor. Based upon the two hypotheses formulated from the theoretical models, empirical evidence will be presented to confirm that land lessors with internal tenants (inside the lessor’s own village and assumed to be leased under complete information) has a higher probability of choosing a fixed-rent contract. Conversely, land lessor who leases to an external tenant outside their village (operating under incomplete information) is more likely to choose share contract.====The empirical part of this article utilizes field survey data collected from Guangdong, China due to the frequency of farmland leasing relative to other provinces. Leasing in Guangdong is more frequent because this province was the first to adopt marketization reform program especially involving farmland leasing market reform in China (Wang and Zhang 2017). The small agrarian community in Guangdong of China is typically characterized by close personal relations between land lessors and tenants. Under this type of relationship, land lessors have the opportunity to collect sufficient information regarding his tenant’s conduct via casual observation and gossiping without undertaking explicit monitoring activities. These personal relationships encourage the development of complete information environment. So, the effect of information structure on farmland leasing contractual choice can be estimated by understanding rural community relations that reinforce the mechanism of contract enforcement. Thus, a quasi-experiment is envisioned where farmland lease contracts between lessors and tenants inside the same village operate under complete information as the treatment versus contracts between lessors and external tenants (from outside the village) operate under incomplete information.====The contributions of this article include: (1) transaction costs are integrated into the theoretical model of contractual choice which combines a principal-agent model and revised tax-equivalent approach to farmland leasing; and (2) the theoretical and empirical implications of this model are that under incomplete information, share contracts will be preferred and fixed-rent contracts will be less likely to be chosen by land lessors. These results are consistent with the theoretical findings from Newbery (1977) and Hallagan (1978), and are supported by the empirical results from Ackerberg and Botticini (2000) and Bellemare (2012), which are based on the postulate of risk aversion.","The effect of information structure on farmland contractual choice: toward a revised theory of share tenancy with new evidence from Guangdong, China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301629,27 October 2020,2020,Research Article,105.0

It builds on the similarity literature in law and economics, and uses the case study of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal to explore whether judges tend to decide in favor of parties represented by lawyers who are “similar” to them in terms of shared educational backgrounds or workplaces. Our findings show that lawyers who are more similar to judges perform significantly better in terms of winning cases. This association remains when controlling for lawyer, judge, and panel effects. The results point to the importance of social interactions inside and outside the courtroom on judicial decision-making, and prompt reflection regarding court design.","Do lawyers affect litigation outcomes? Studies have shown that they do, and that litigation success is in part attributable to the relative capability of the litigating lawyers (Johnson et al., 2006, Haynie and Sill, 2007, Szmer et al., 2007, Szmer et al., 2016). Existing scholarship that takes seriously the impact of lawyers on case outcomes typically looks at lawyer-specific traits, for example whether more experienced or skilled lawyers affect litigation success rates. This article also investigates the impact of lawyers on litigation outcomes, but we test another explanation. Specifically, we examine the extent to which the ==== between judges and the lawyers arguing before them influences the judges’ decision.====Hypotheses centered around the similarities between judges and other actors are not new to the field of law and economics.==== However, the types of relationships examined in existing works that study the effects of similarity are limited. For instance, the literature on panel effects has shown how ideological similarities within the bench can influence judicial outcomes. Those works pursue the hypothesis that voting behavior varies according to panel compositions, especially in the North American context (Cross and Tiller, 1997, Sunstein et al., 2004, Miles and Sunstein, 2006). They find that a liberal-minded judge votes more liberally when he or she is deciding a case with liberal-minded peers, and the opposite holds true when a conservative-minded judge decides with conservative-minded peers. Similarly, works by Choi and Gulati (2008) and Blanes i Vidal and Leaver (2011) examine how similarities among judges and other legal actors affect case citations and judicial promotions. Choi and Gulati find that circuit judges in the United States tend to cite cases decided by outside-circuit judges who are of a similar political background. The bias, they argue, is likely ideologically driven, since the results also show that the judges tend to avoid citing cases decided by judges of the opposite political party in high-stakes cases. Blanes i Vidal and Leaver's focus is on whether “connectivity” between promotion committees and judges – based on narrowly defined shared backgrounds – influences judicial promotion in the United Kingdom. While their results suggest that elites were more likely to be promoted, their findings do not seem to support a hypothesis of explicit favoritism. The relationships involved in these studies are largely between judges themselves, or between judges and judicial appointment bodies.====This article applies the insights of the literature on similarity to a relationship that is often overlooked, that is lawyers and judges. We explore whether judges tend to decide in favor of parties represented by lawyers who are “similar” to them. The lawyer-judge relationship is a particularly interesting relationship for the study of similarity effects because of the conditions and restrictions present in lawyer-judge interactions. Lawyer-judge interactions are highly structured. Most interactions happen in courtrooms and are guided by legal procedures. The interaction time is relatively short, as there are rules limiting irrelevant and unnecessary submissions. Courtroom interactions are conditioned by legalese and legal norms, which impose a particular type of logic into the discourse. The rhetoric depersonalizes the parties involved inside the courtroom, and codes of conduct regulate behavior outside the courtrooms to ensure arms-length relationships between lawyers and judges, especially when they are involved in the one case. Judgments, and sometimes the legal submissions made by both parties, are generally available to the public, thereby subjecting their interactions to public scrutiny. These conditions and restrictions limit the nature of interaction and aspire to eliminate biases arising from individuals’ personal backgrounds and/or personal interaction. In theory, it is much more difficult for lawyers and judges to actively commit to certain types of relationships, let alone act on them during litigation. This notwithstanding, judges and lawyers are human beings. It is plausible that a lawyer may score more points simply because the judge subconsciously associates with the lawyer that resembles him or her more. In addition, judges’ understanding of the law and preferred style of arguing are informed by their past experiences, especially in legal academies and professional workplaces. It is conceivable that judges might find lawyers who share a common understanding of the law or adopt a similar legal rhetoric more persuasive. In short, despite the various constraints in lawyer-judge interactions that limit biases, there are still reasons to believe that similarity matters, or that the “law of attraction” (Byrne and Griffitt, 1966) can creep into litigation.====In sum, just as ordinary people may be attracted to and agree with those who share similar interests and hobbies, we hypothesize that:====These questions are empirically evaluated through a unique dataset of 776 cases decided by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal from 1997 to 2017, together with background information on the barristers (who are lawyers who specialize in litigation) appearing in and the judges presiding over these cases. Networks of past education and chambers (which are shared workplaces for barristers) are used as proxies for similarity between judges and lawyers. It is postulated that similarities between judges and lawyers can be based on, among others, jurisprudential ideologies as well as professional and social norms, and that these mechanisms can be operating at the same time with different intensities. The key hypothesis is that lawyer-judge similarities can be an important determinant of judicial decision-making. The objective of this article is not to empirically disentangle the different channels through which lawyer-judge similarity effects may operate, but rather to show the relevance of lawyer-judge similarity to judicial decision-making. Although it can be the case that similarity causally drives decision-making, empirically verifying this causal direction is difficult and the mechanisms constituting such an association can vary.==== While our research design stops short of untangling these various mechanisms, we will make suggestions as to what kinds of similarities are more likely to affect judicial decision-making in Hong Kong.====A more thorough description of the legal profession in Hong Kong will be provided below, but it is helpful here to briefly discuss why Hong Kong is selected as a case-study for this research. The legal profession in Hong Kong is a relatively tight community: as of 2019, there were around 1500 barristers and 140 sets of chambers. Barristers are lawyers that specialize in litigation. They argue in court and have an unusual proximity to judges when compared to solicitors, who are lawyers that cannot generally appear and conduct proceedings in court. Only a handful of Hong Kong based judges sit on the Court of Final Appeal.==== These judges were all previously barristers, and most barristers and judges received their legal education in Hong Kong and/or the United Kingdom. There is limited variability regarding the legal academies they attended. Given the close proximity of judges and barristers and their shared legal academies and (former) workplaces, the possibility for similarity effects seems especially pronounced within the Hong Kong legal environment.====Though barristers are free to move to other sets of chambers and chambers might change addresses, barristers tend to stay in one or two specific sets of chambers for most of their career and sets of chambers tend to exist for long periods of time. The Hong Kong Bar Association provides information on chambers memberships of barristers and judges, and the Hong Kong Legal Information Institute publishes information on all cases heard at the Court of Final Appeal, including the barristers arguing the case and the judges present. Combining these sources of information allows for the investigation of the similarity between barristers and judges and its influence on the outcome of cases.====The rest of the article is divided into six parts. Part II presents the judicial system and legal profession of Hong Kong. Part III outlines the two main hypotheses of this article. Part IV presents the data and methodology, and offers descriptive insights into the networks of interaction between judges and barristers in Hong Kong. Part V develops the analytical strategy. The results are presented in Part VI, where we also evaluate alternative explanations for our findings, including skill differentials between lawyers, as well as judge and panel effects. To conclude, Part VII discusses the implications of this article's findings regarding the nature of judicial decision-making and court design in Hong Kong and beyond.",The law of attraction: How similarity between judges and lawyers helps win cases in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301575,21 October 2020,2020,Research Article,106.0

In this paper, we explore one channel through which political alignment of the judges can manifest itself and verify whether political party support, expressed as a recommendation to the tribunal, is relevant for the allocation of judges to ==== panels. Our specific example comes from the Polish Constitutional Tribunal and refers to the period 2005-2014. With respect to the mass of filed cases, we do not find that allocation of judges to adjudication panels favored nominees of any political party. Our results however provide support for the strategic selection to adjudication panels in politically sensitive cases in the period 2011-2014. We find that nominees of the governing party were allocated to these panels more often than other members of the tribunal and that in these cases they had more voting power than in cases of lower political clout.","The independence of judicial system is often considered as ==== for the functioning of liberal democracy and economic prosperity. Indeed, it has been argued that independently performing judicial system plays a fundamental role in making political and economic freedom possible (La Porta et al., 2004), as well as for supporting economic growth (Voigt et al., 2015).====That being said, judicial impartiality has often been called into question. Furthermore, doubts about court independence and politicization of judicial system have been raised not only with respect to authoritarian regimes or captured democracies, but also with reference to countries that are commonly perceived as consolidated democracies and free. While in the latter cases the patterns of political influences on constitutional courts are quite complex, the studies by Franck (2009) for France, Amaral-Garcia et al. (2009) for Portugal, or Garoupa et al. (2013) for Spain substantiate the claims about political ideologies affecting the behavior of constitutional judges. Attempts of American presidents to shape the ideological character of U.S. Supreme Court (Segal and Spaeth, 1993) or the recent election of Stephan Harbarth, the CDU’s parliamentary group vice-president, as a vice-president of the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany provide further illustrations that political alignment of the judges seems to importantly influence their selection.====Most of the existing literature, which studies judicial insulation from politics, is based either on checking whether court rulings are in line with the expectations of political majority, or on examining the extent to which the behavior of individual judges can be accounted for by various political variables. In this paper we try to further contribute to this strand of research, but with a different focus. Our aim is to test one particular channel, through which political alignment may shape the rulings of constitutional court. More specifically, our focus is on the composition of adjudication panels and on checking whether they are strategically selected to assure that winning coalitions in these panels are formed by nominees of a given political grouping. The rationale behind this focus is the following. In the environment characterized by high political turnover and political appointment of the judges, it is likely that subsequent court members are elected by various governing coalitions.==== In this case, the potential for tilting court verdicts in favor of a given political grouping would hinge on a strategic composition of adjudication panels. Indeed, with members of the court being effectively nominated by several political parties, judges with a given political alignment may affect the decision of the court only if they can participate in a winning coalition within the panel. This, in turn, depends on the selection of judges to panels. To the extent that political polarization translates into the functioning of constitutional courts, one may assume that judges with a given political alignment will appear on adjudication panels more often than judges with a different political alignment. In addition, to the extent that constitutional court reacts to political influences, this should be reflected in the frequency with which judges aligned with a given political party adjudicate with other judges of the same alignment. Given the fact that constitutional courts adjudicate on a number of issues which can be considered as apolitical, it seems reasonable to assume that the strategic composition of adjudication panels should be especially visible in the cases that can be considered politically sensitive.====In this paper we check to what extent the pattern of selecting adjudication panels fits the portrayal sketched above using the case of one particular constitutional court. Our example is based on data from the Polish Constitutional Tribunal and the period 2005-2014, with a special focus on years 2011-2014. We take advantage of the fact that, while there are fifteen judges in the court, a lot of verdicts are pronounced by adjudication panels composed of five judges. While judge’s appointment to cases should follow some rules (see further), the ultimate decision about the assignment of judges to panels is made by the president of the tribunal. This allows us to check whether the panels, especially if they refer to politically sensitive cases, are strategically selected or not. To achieve that, we test whether political alignment of a judge affects the number of verdicts he/she decides upon or the incidence he/she adjudicates in panels with other judges of the same alignment. This research problem fits not only recent developments in law and economics and constitutional economics, but also contributes to the current debate on the status of key Polish judiciary institutions.====Clearly, while a prejudiced selection to adjudication panels may lead to politically biased verdicts of constitutional court benches, it should not be treated as an automatic evidence of violation of justice.==== This needs to be kept in mind when interpreting our results. It should be stressed however that the same qualification applies to the vast majority of other studies analyzing the politicization of the constitutional court. What we believe weighs in our favor, is the fact that our research strategy on the issue in question seems to have three important advantages over the other approaches used in the literature. First, looking at the composition of adjudication panels does not require from us to assess whether a given verdict is in line with the interest of the political principal or not. Thanks to this, we do not have to identify the position of each political party on each issue decided by the court. Second, we do not have to assess the legal quality of judgements of the tribunal. Third, as our focus is simply on the composition of adjudication panels and not on the decision that was ultimately made, we do not have to make any assumptions about judges’ private preferences or about the extent to which they would be eager to defend their beliefs against political pressure. This, in turn, allows us to abstract from whether the judges are guided by potential career concerns, loyalty towards their peers, or some ideological agenda.====Our study is related to several strands of the research. On the one hand, we build on the literature that investigates the extent to which court rulings depend on judges’ political preferences. In general, there are two opposing views on that matter. Formalists assume that judges interpret the law while putting aside their ideological preferences, whereas proponents of the attitudinal model assume that court rulings are not free from judges’ political sympathies (for a brief discussion on both these views see, for example, Posner, 2011). The existing evidence suggests that political partisanship of court members often importantly affects their verdicts (Segal and Spaeth, 1993; Pinello, 1999; Ginsburg, 2003; Harris and Sen, 2019). This finding is important given our focus, as it provides the rationale for the strategic selection of adjudication panels. Indeed, should the political preferences of judges be irrelevant for their verdicts, any attempt to affect the composition of adjudication panels would be pointless. In this context, our work is closely related to the paper by Kantorowicz and Garoupa (2016). The study investigates whether the decision-making of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal was characterized by party alignment over the period 2003-2014 and supports this presumption. In this paper, we complement their findings by showing that, at least partly, this result could be explained by a strategic selection of court benches adjudicating on politically sensitive cases in the period 2011-2014.====By adopting this focus, our paper adds to the growing literature on the selection of judges to adjudication panels and its consequences for providing unbiased legal judgements (Sunstein et al., 2006; Boyd et al., 2010; Kastellec, 2011, 2013; Anwar et al., 2012, 2019; Harris and Sen, 2019). There has been an increasing recognition that the decisions judges make depend not only on their own views but also on the preferences of the judiciary as a whole and on the preferences of people selected to a given adjudication panel. The latter finding is especially interesting given our focus as it provides additional rationale for why the composition of a panel may reflect strategic behavior. Compared to these studies our paper tries to make two contributions. First, most of the available evidence comes from the U.S. In this paper we study the composition of adjudication panels in a different geographical context. Second, and perhaps more importantly, whereas the existing studies show that the composition of the panel may matter for the verdict, they rarely investigate whether the selection to adjudication panels reflects strategic behavior. In our study we attempt to address this issue at least partly. To achieve that, we analyze the composition of adjudication panels and compare the panels adjudicating on cases that can be considered as politically sensitive with the panels adjudicating on cases that can be deemed apolitical.====The paper is structured as follows.

Moreover, the bursting of the internet bubble, the global financial crisis (GFC), and the European sovereign debt crisis (SDC) have jointly generated costs in the world economy of approximately USD 30 trillions (see Taskinsoy, 2019). There are also indications that the causes of many crises are often similar. Overbeek (2012), for example, cites overaccumulation as the main driver of financial markets since the 1980s. As a result, it seems reasonable to address the reasons for the last two major financial crises in the world's two largest economies in a literature survey. To avoid such enormous financial repercussions in the future, scholars have delivered a large variety of critical examinations of the financial and sovereign debt crises and the decisive role of regulatory circumstances in order to eliminate such deficiencies. Thus, the question arises as to what extent the regulatory institutions and framework conditions were insufficient or could even have encouraged crises. Second, the question must be answered as to which measures or automatism influenced regulators’ decisions on how to counteract the crisis. Finally, it is important to consider the extent to which new or ongoing regulatory adjustments or innovations influence the occurrence and course of future crises. Thus, to organize our discussion, we structured the paper into three sections (see Fig. 1) based on the identified crisis-related regulatory literature. This investigation was divided into three areas:====However, the question arises why financial markets need to be regulated, when the literature actually assumes the existence of an at least moderately efficient market hypothesis (EMH).==== It can be addressed in manifold ways: externalities such as bubbles and crashes, inefficient market structures, principal-agent problems, market entry/exit barriers, a lack of market integrity, or by considering financial market stability as a public good (see De Grauwe, 2011, Chaudary and Salvador-Adebayo, 2014). Since the incentives that the regulatory framework creates for decision-makers in the financial sector also play an important role, we present future potential research directions from both practical and academic perspectives. We argue in this paper that especially the concept of regulatory arbitrage may reveal that regulatory rules are often no panacea, but may even work to exacerbate crises (see Acharya and Richardson, 2009, Dagher and Fu, 2017). This view must not be taken as an opportunity to completely question the significance of regulatory and legal frameworks. Rather, a critical examination of their strengths and weaknesses is necessary in order to identify possible future Achilles’ heels in the financial system in general and the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU), and to deal with them accordingly. In doing so, we draw on the above-mentioned subdivision into the causes and effects of and reactions to the crises. Additionally, we reviewed recommendations to prevent similar crises in the future. In addition to the banking sector and the financial services industry, the insurance sector must also be included in this debate because it has been become an increasingly important actor in maintaining financial market stability (see Trichet, 2005, French et al., 2015).====Our literature survey is based on a structured and standardized search and identification process proposed by a collection of scientific publications (see Biener and Eling, 2012, Biener et al., 2015, Eling and Schnell, 2016, Eling and Lehmann, 2018). We review the English-language scholarly literature by using basic operations of Boolean algebra “TI[(financial regulation) OR (banking regulation) OR (insurance law) OR (insurance regulation) OR (regulatory authorities) OR (supervision)] AND TI[(crisis) OR (subprime) OR (sovereign debt)]”==== in the journal databases EBSCOhost (Academic Search Ultimate, Business Source Elite, Business Source Ultimate and EconLit), ProQuest (20 databases in the social and economic sciences),==== and the Social Science Research Network (SSRN). We then review academic articles, working papers, industry studies, and reports from January 2007 to May 2020 to cover the periods of the GFC and SDC. Moreover, we review citations in the identified papers to include further publications of interest. Additionally, we searched for supportive material via Google Scholar and regular Google searches. Based on this search and identification process a database of 455 papers is generated which main results are discussed.====The objective of this paper is to motivate further research interest in in-depth analyses of financial regulatory issues by bringing together the results of previous studies dealing with the cause-and-effect relationships of crises in a survey and, in particular, link our findings in the context of the regulatory frameworks.==== The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature on the causes of the financial and sovereign debt crises, focusing especially on the role of regulatory frameworks. In Section 3, we summarize relevant academic findings on policy reactions enacted over the course of the crises with a special focus on the interdependencies between the individual crisis sectors (i.e., sovereign debt crisis and financial crisis). Section 4 summarizes the findings from Sections 2 and 3 and formulates recommendations for regulatory action. Section 5 concludes the paper and provides recommendations for future research by focusing on the outlook and the question of the financial sector's resilience regarding future crisis events.","The global financial crisis, the EMU sovereign debt crisis and international financial regulation: lessons from a systematic literature review",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301587,3 October 2020,2020,Research Article,108.0

Answering this vexed question matters a great deal, not only for the parties involved in a dismissal dispute but also for policy makers evaluating how legislation designed to provide basic workers’ rights is enforced in practice. In the context of Australian labour courts, our previous research (Freyens and Gong (2017)) considered the influence of social values on judicial decisions. Specifically, we examined how judges’ own social values (proxied by their past history as labour lawyers) together with the values of the political party appointing them affected their decisions. We examined the extent to which these factors related to judges’ propensity to decide cases in favour of the plaintiffs (dismissed employees). We then interacted these values with the social values embodied in the law (legislated statutes and their reforms). We found significant effects from all three channels, particularly after the so-called WorkChoices reforms, which made access to unfair dismissal remedies more difficult for dismissed employees. ====, judicial decisions in dismissal cases varied significantly with (and were predictably signed by) the social values of judicial appointees and political appointors. Judges whose social values were unaligned with the WorkChoices reforms responded orthogonally, i.e. by meting out decisions that countered the reforms. In other words, we found significant evidence that labour court judges behave as activists.====In the present work we push our investigation further to check for the influence of other judges on individual decisions (peer effects). Our objective is to determine whether labour court judges operating in the same jurisdiction (State-based panels) influence one another's decisions. If spatial correlation among decisions was established, we could potentially infer that the significant political activism found in our previous study may spillover onto the behaviour of non-activist judges, providing an expansion channel for the spread of activism in labour courts. The presence of strong peer effects would have substantial implications for policy designs aimed at countering political activism in labour courts. For instance, attempts to take judicial nomination and appointment prerogatives away from the executive branch of government==== [64] would presumably be more effective if courtroom decisions are influenced by independently-minded peer groups rather than by vested interest and ideologically-motivated politicians.====There is much that researchers can do to isolate peer effects and we review a number of approaches and findings in our literature review. The spatial econometrics methodology pioneered by Manski (1993) is by far the most popular method, although it has too rarely been used to examine judicial decisions, and its scope for ill-advised attributions of causality has been a recurrent subject of controversy, which we will also touch on (Hanushek et al. (2003), Angrist (2014)). The Manski approach Manski (1993) rests on a decomposition of peer effects into two broad types of hypothesized interactions: endogenous (behavioural) interactions and exogenous (type) interactions. Endogenous effects arise when individual behaviour depends on the average (aggregate) behaviour of the group: in our context, individual judges may decide more (or less) often in favour of dismissed employees because that is what their peers do. Exogenous effects arise when individual behaviour depends on the exogenous characteristics of their reference group: individual judges may decide more often in favour of dismissed employees not because their peers do so but because the composition of their peer group is exclusively made out of former union lawyers. Endogenous effects are of particular interest because they can give rise to ‘social multipliers’: an intervention that alters behaviour in the reference group will tend to be more effective due to behavioural spillover effects within the reference group. Identifying social interactions with spatial econometrics methods is fraught with several difficulties that have to be overcome: there can be selection bias==== through endogenous group formation (e.g. if judges are only appointed when they have previously worked with currently serving judges), or there could be correlated effects that arise when members of a reference group behave similarly because of an unobserved institutional feature (e.g. if all judges had been instructed by the same expert). We will test for these potential issues and show why they do not present identification problems for our study (the autonomous political appointment process largely rules out the selection effect). However, the largest hurdle to overcome is addressing the so-called ‘reflection effect’, which arises from the simultaneous and reciprocal nature of the relation between outcome (individual judicial decision) and regressor (average or aggregate peer decisions). In our estimation section we present our approach to dealing with both the correlated effect issue (omitted variables) and the reflection problem.====In this paper, we use spatial econometric methods to analyze a panel of 82 judges and a data set of 2223 unfair dismissal cases arbitrated over a 15 year period. We test for the presence of endogenous and exogenous effects in judicial decisions. In doing so, we will address a number of the potential methodological issues that could invalidate our results, such as the need to establish the conditions of a randomized experiment and to address the reflection problem.

Weak enforcement capacities, though, can be an obstacle to the accomplishment of this goal. This problem seems especially acute in the case of supranational regimes like the EU. While it arguably constitutes the most far-reaching experiment in peaceful supranational governance, the EU possesses very little administrative capacity. Despite popular depictions of the EU as an oversized and bloated bureaucracy, it has fewer than 35,000 permanent civil servants on its payroll. There is no EU police or EU armed forces. Nor is there an EU court system comparable to the US federal judiciary. The Court of Justice and the General Court are the only judicial bodies erected by the EU. A corollary is that the primary responsibility for enforcing EU laws and regulations lies with national governments. The enforcement of EU rules thus depends on domestic actors and institutions the EU did not create and does not control directly. Yet governments can prove ineffective and may even seek to evade their enforcement duties (Börzel et al., 2004). Private enforcement through domestic courts is viewed – and seemingly actively pursued by EU institutions – as a remedy to the enforcement deficit (Kelemen, 2012). To the extent that they create legal rights enforceable in courts, regulations can be enforced by business and private individuals acting “as private attorney generals” (Kagan, 2001, p. 47). Empirically, the extent to which private enforcement represents an effective enforcement approach is a question that naturally ties into the broader issue of what drives EU law use. Empirical research has relied on the number of requests for a preliminary ruling passed on to the Court of Justice of the European Union as the most reliable proxy for EU law use (Hornuf and Voigt, 2015, Pitarakis and Tridimas, 2003, Stone Sweet and Brunell, 1998a). Requests for preliminary rulings are submitted to the ECJ judges at the behest of domestic judges. Following Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the decision is a matter of discretion for courts whose rulings are subject to appeal but mandatory for last instance courts when EU law is material to the legal dispute. Based on this proxy, EU law use seems to vary significantly across member states. This observation has spurred a search for explanations. One prominent theory – which can be described as “economic neo-functionalism” – emphasises the role of transnational exchange as both catalyst and engine of legal integration. Positing a positive, self-reinforcing relationship between cross-border activity and EU law litigation, it claims that economic agents engaging in cross-border activities are those with the strongest incentive to invoke EU rules to challenge domestic violations. Where these agents are more present, therefore, we should expect EU law use to be more frequent. The main piece of empirical evidence marshalled to back the trade hypothesis has been the correlation between intra-EU trade in goods and annual referral rates per member state (Stone Sweet and Brunell, 1998a). This account of legal integration has not gone unchallenged. Scholars have questioned the validity and robustness of the alleged causal nexus (Wind et al., 2009, Pitarakis and Tridimas, 2003, Hornuf and Voigt, 2015). The data and broad empirical strategy that has informed this debate, though, present several limitations. The relationship between trade and referral activity has been estimated by aggregating the data at the country level. While, according to Article 267 TFEU, the decision to submit a preliminary reference formally lies with judges, the nature of a dispute and, therefore, its relation to EU law are normally defined by the parties. The parties also decide what legal arguments to make before the judge and whether to invoke EU law. So patterns of referral activity are obviously influenced by both litigants and judges (Pitarakis and Tridimas, 2003). Yet these dynamics are hard to separate out with data aggregated at the country level. Another limitation relates to the proxy used for trade. Eurostat data on intra-EU trade only captures trade in goods, although EU internal market regulations go beyond trade in goods. The EU's remit has expanded significantly since the 1960s to cover areas such as services, capital flows and labour mobility. At the same time, the share of manufacturing and agriculture in the economic output of its member states has decreased while the share of services has gone up. Dyevre and Lampach (2018a) show that the correlation between referral rates and intra-EU trade in goods has decreased steadily over time, which implies that trade in goods may not adequately capture the role of transnational economic exchange at more advanced stages of integration.====In this article, we seek to advance our empirical understanding of private enforcement by addressing these measurement limitations. First, we follow Kelemen and Pavone (2016) in adopting the subnational region as our level of analysis. While data aggregated at the regional level offers less analytical leverage than would court or judge-level data, it is a substantial improvement on country-level aggregation. Compiling the geographic coordinates of the entire universe of courts that have submitted references to the ECJ from 1961 to 2017, our new dataset allows us, in particular, to exploit variations in the location of institutions, such as courts of last resorts, to control for their effect – something impossible to do in a country-level analysis. Second, we present a new proxy for cross-border economic activity. We argue that EU trademark registrations represent a strong proxy for cross-border economic activity, because the net benefits of using EU trademark protection are a function of the number of member states in which the trademark user operates. Unlike other proxies for international commerce, EU trademark registrations cover trade in services as well as goods. Consistent with theories emphasising the link between economic and legal integration, we find that regions with higher concentrations of EU trademark users generate significantly more referrals. Our analysis suggests that private enforcement is more effective in regions with large trade hubs and less so in more peripheral regions with economies less exposed to international trade. Global players and multinational companies are likely to be the most reliable private enforcers of EU regulations.====The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 summarizes the two strands of literature which, combined, provide the theoretical context for our empirical argument. Section 3 defends two important assumptions underpinning our hypothesis, which respectively pertain to the evolution of transnational economic exchange and the general focus of EU rules and regulations. Section 4 explains why, in our view, EU trademark registrations better capture the nature of cross-border trade at advanced stages of the integration process than measures exclusively based on intra-EU trade in goods. This section further elaborates on the analytical gains of shifting the level of analysis from the national to the subnational level. Section 5 presents the methodology and results of our empirical assessment of the relationship between EU trademark registrations and referral rates. Finally, we conclude with some remarks on possible improvements and future research.",Merchant hubs and spatial disparities in the private enforcement of international trade regimes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301599,9 October 2020,2020,Research Article,117.0
Yang Erya,"Department of Economics, University of California, Irvine, United States","Received 17 August 2019, Revised 9 August 2020, Accepted 10 August 2020, Available online 28 August 2020, Version of Record 23 September 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.irle.2020.105935,Cited by (5),"This paper uses the rank-dependent expected utility (RDEU) model to capture the effects of ==== and ==== on the choice between a pre-trial settlement and a trial (or more generally, between a private settlement and a litigation). These two legal procedures are described as a bargaining game and a contest game, respectively. My models predict that a contest occurs if the aggregate optimism premium in a contest (====) is sufficiently high. I also find that the ==== tends to be higher for close cases. Such predictions are consistent with the Priest-Klein empirical observation that a plaintiff's winning probability is often near 50% in many areas of civil litigation. I also show that the highest levels of effort in both a bargaining game and a contest game are exerted when one is moderately optimistic. However, excessive optimism will reduce one's effort level, and hence, one's winning rate. As a result, when faced with an excessively optimistic party, a risk-neutral party may prefer a contest over bargaining.","In a civil dispute, legal decision-makers may choose either to go to trial or to accept a settlement.==== They may choose a trial over a settlement, even though the monetary gain obtained from a trial could be lower. For example, Kiser et al. (2008) compared rejected settlement offers to actual trial or arbitration verdicts in 2054 cases between 1964 and 2004, and found that the majority of the rejected settlement offers were higher than or equal to the adjudication awards.====In the situation described above, a settlement generates a higher value with certainty, while a trial not only generates a lower expected value but also involves risk and uncertainty. Thus, the choice of a trial over a settlement cannot be explained using an expected utility (EU) model with risk-aversion. However, risk-seeking does not always capture the thinking of a legal decision-maker. For example, an empirical study found that a settlement is more likely to occur when the stakes involved are higher (Fournier and Zuehlke, 1989).==== With the standard EU model, such a choice contradicts risk-seeking.====Priest and Klein (1984) observed an empirical pattern that agrees well with some degree of optimism in legal decision-makers’ choice between a trial and a settlement. Their empirical evidence in many areas of civil litigation suggests that the plaintiff's trial winning rate is often around 50%. To explain this, they developed the Priest-Klein trial selection hypothesis (henceforth, the P-K hypothesis):====To derive this hypothesis, Priest and Klein (1984) propose a trial selection model where both parties make unbiased estimations of their trial-winning probabilities. Such probabilities are exogenous, but are unknown to the parties. The overestimation of one's winning probability is interpreted as optimism (Priest and Klein, 1984). Such interpretation is also adopted in empirical studies (see, e.g. Waldfogel, 1995). In a broader sense, some legal scholars attribute optimism as a hurdle to reaching a settlement (Babcock and Loewenstein, 1997, Korobkin, 2005, Munsinger and Philbin Jr., 2016, O’Grady, 2006). Although the concept of optimism is defined loosely in these papers, it is generally conceived of as a situation where either the perceived or the estimated probability of winning is higher than the true probability.====Motivated by the interest in the effects of optimism – the overestimation or the over-weighting of the probability of winning – on a choice between going to trial or settling, this paper studies a more general situation, where two agents with optimistic or pessimistic attitudes must decide how to allocate a divisible valuable resource. The decision is modeled as a choice between a bargaining game and a winner-take-all contest game. In contrast to the previous literature, this paper does not rely on errors in the assessments of the probability of winning, but emphasizes the notions of optimism and pessimism linked more directly to preferences that differ from EU. Specifically, in the games, the two agents are assumed to have complete information about the strategies and the payoffs. Contest-winning probabilities are objective, thus ambiguity attitudes are irrelevant. Furthermore, the agents are assumed to be risk-neutral in outcome. Each agent's preference is represented by the rank-dependent expected utility (RDEU) model, as in Quiggin, 1982, Quiggin, 2012. An optimistic agent will place lower decision weight on the probability of less desirable outcomes and higher decision weight on more desirable outcomes. Meanwhile, a pessimistic agent will do the opposite.==== Optimism can produce risk-seeking choices even if the agent's utility index for outcome is linear (or concave).==== Here, in the context of the choice between bargaining and a contest, such preferences can generate the empirical legal patterns mentioned earlier.====The first model in this paper is a simultaneous-move conflict game where the two parties’ winning probabilities are exogenous. This situation captures the decision in civil litigation of whether to accept a pre-trial settlement or to go to trial. At this stage, the two parties have already gone through pretrial discovery and conferences, and the case's merits and winning probabilities for each party are clear. Bargaining is conducted under the shadow of a contest, in the sense that a contest occurs if the bargaining breaks down. In this model, the contest that the parties enter if the bargaining breaks down is the same as the contest that the parties voluntarily enter by opting out of bargaining.====In the contest game, each party incurs a contest cost, ====; while the bargaining game is cost-free. In equilibrium, a contest occurs when the aggregate optimism premium in a contest (====) is greater than ====. Such a condition can be satisfied even if the bargaining game has a higher expected value after considering the cost of a contest. This prediction matches the empirical pattern described in Kiser et al. (2008). Since the ==== tends to be higher when the winning probability is closer to 50%, those cases are more likely to go to trials. This situation generates the P-K empirical observation as described in Priest and Klein (1984). Furthermore, one's share from the bargaining game increases (decreases) as one becomes more (less) optimistic relative to her opponent. This suggests that optimism increases one's bargaining power.====This paper also considers a more general situation where the parties’ contest game winning probabilities and bargaining game outcomes are endogenously determined by their effort choices in each game. In this setting, the contest that parties voluntarily enter by opting out of bargaining and the contest that they have to enter when bargaining breaks down have different characteristics. This generalization reflects the choice of whether to file litigation in court or to settle in a private venue. A private settlement affects many factors that may change the litigation outcome, including the timing, procedure, and the dynamics between the parties; so the litigation that occurs if settlement fails is different from the litigation that the parties enter without a private settlement. In a bargaining game of this model, the parties will expend their bargaining efforts only; while in a contest game, each party will expend their contest effort in addition to the contest cost, C. The probabilities of winning and losing are determined by the parties’ effort choices via a contest success function (CSF).====When the two parties are identical and optimistic, they will always expend the same level of equilibrium effort, and their best response settlement effort choice will be the same as their best response contest effort choice. Therefore, for each party, the expected allocation of the asset will be 50% in a contest, and the share of the settlement will likewise be 50%. Although a contest would be more costly considering the additional contest cost, C, the two parties will choose a contest when ====.====When one party is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, and the other party is optimistic, the choice between bargaining and a contest will be more complicated. The model predicts that in both options, the effort from the optimistic party will be higher than the EU prediction only when she is moderately optimistic. An excessively optimistic agent will expend less effort in a contest, and as a result, her contest-winning rate may be low. Indeed, Theorem 4(3) suggests that the optimistic party's highest winning probability in a contest game is only around 0.5124, obtained when she is moderately optimistic (====); and decreases to 0 as she becomes more optimistic. In contrast, her share from bargaining monotonically increases with her optimism attitudes and is bounded by ====. Thus, under some suitable contest cost, a sufficiently optimistic agent may prefer bargaining over a contest. At the same time, her opponent – the neutral party – may have a high winning rate in a contest but can only obtain a low share in bargaining, and thus, the neutral party may prefer a contest over bargaining.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes additional related literature. Section 3 introduces the preliminaries. There are two main results in this paper, Theorems 3 and 4. Section 4 discusses the case when the winning probabilities in any contest are exogenous and identical, and develops Theorem 3. Section 5 generalizes the contest game and the bargaining game to the situation where the contest-winning probabilities are endogenously determined by parties’ effort choices, and develops Theorem 4.

Focusing primarily on pharmaceutical innovation, we analyze various policy interventions to solve this underinvestment problem. In particular, we describe a new approach for a “value-based” ==== system, which ties patent protection to an underlying invention's social value, and we show how such a system could incentivize socially optimal innovation.","In a competitive market, research and development is risky because firms must recover up-front fixed costs through future expense reductions or increased sales. Unfortunately, R&D is likely produced in socially suboptimal quantities due to the knowledge spillovers it generates and the potential for competitors to free-ride on originators’ efforts. Accordingly, society subsidizes R&D to increase the quantity produced through direct subsidies and research grants, tax credits and deductions, rewards, and patents (Grabowski et al., 2015; Hemel and Ouellette, 2013; Shavell and Van Ypersele, 2001; Kremer, 1998).====While many scholars have focused on which innovation policies optimally encourage R&D spending, there has been less focus on the specific R&D activities these firms pursue. Put differently, firms typically can pick from a menu of potential R&D investments. Given this choice, are they picking socially optimal R&D projects?====Generally, the profit motive should induce firms to choose R&D projects that society values highly. But as we show in this paper, sometimes even risk-neutral firms are excessively conservative compared to a social planner when selecting investment projects in innovation markets. The problem is particularly acute in pharmaceuticals, though our argument could also extend to other markets. Most closely, medical devices are another large market in which firms have insufficient incentives to take socially optimal levels of risk, as one of us argues in a companion piece (Sukhatme and Bloche, 2019).====We begin by providing an empirical motivation for this phenomenon and explain why firms often invest in marginally beneficial or “me-too” drugs, which are often highly profitable despite providing minimal marginal social benefits. We then present both discrete- and continuous-choice models that explain how a firm's return function—what the firm earns as a function of an underlying invention's social value—creates a wedge between its incentives and those of the social planner, even when a firm is risk-neutral like the social planner. We show how this wedge can persist even with competition and potential new entrants into the market, and further discuss how product differentiation impacts our results.====We then assess how various conventional policy interventions—such as changing the drug approval threshold, awarding prizes, and assessing lump-sum taxes—might address this disconnect between social and private incentives. Among other things, we show that if the threshold to award a prize is set too low, prizes can result in even lower quality innovation than would occur in their absence.====Finally, we model a novel approach to patents—a value-based patent system, where more socially valuable inventions receive heightened patent protection (e.g., longer patent duration) as compared to less socially valuable ones. We show how a value-based patent system generates higher-quality innovation than the status quo, while not inadvertently incentivizing low-value innovation, as would occur with across-the-board increases in patent protection. We close with a few suggestions on how a value-based patent system might be implemented in practice, referencing other research we are conducting contemporaneously.",Reaching for mediocrity: Competition and stagnation in pharmaceutical innovation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301472,3 August 2020,2020,Research Article,119.0

The empirical evidence reported here seems to imply that fixed income markets have reacted to the recent economic and financial crisis in Europe by starting to price in a significant possibility of government debt defaults – which means that all of a sudden sovereign credit risk (and possibly even redenomination risk) have become of some importance in the process of determining government bond prices. Given that long-term fixed income securities are an important asset class for European life insurers the findings reported here could be of some importance for regulators and lawmakers because the newly introduced Solvency II insurance regulation framework ignores these risks with regard to the calculation of solvency capital requirements. Therefore, further work to improve the new regulatory regime might still be needed.","The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC) tries to harmonize the regulation of insurance companies in the European Union (see, for example, Doff, 2008 and Rae et al., 2018). The political processes that have driven this ambitious reform project of the framework for insurance regulation in the European Union have been discussed in some detail by Quaglia (2011). Moreover, Trainar (2006) has stressed the growing complexity of the insurance market and has noted that public policymakers, lawmakers and regulators who supervise this industry are finding it increasingly burdensome to handle the relevant issues. In this difficult environment Solvency II aims to update and modernize the regulatory framework for insurance supervision in Europe (see, for example, Doff, 2008 and Ashby, 2011). Gal and Sehrbrock (2013) have argued convincingly that Solvency II is a project that in the end will lead to fully revised European insurance supervisory law. The two main goals of Solvency II are the protection of the interests of policyholders and the enhancement of financial stability in general (see, amongst others, Gatzert and Wesker, 2012 as well as Eling and Pankoke, 2014). The design of the new regulatory regime in Europe is based on the principles of market consistency and the strengthening of risk management practices in the whole insurance industry (see, for example, Doff, 2008 and Rae et al., 2018). After some delays the Solvency II Directive finally came into effect in January 2016 (see, amongst others, Doff, 2016 and Jørgensen, 2018).====Solvency II is based on a three-pillar structure and therefore is very similar to the Basel II regulatory framework in the banking industry (see, for example, Martin, 2013 and Wagner, 2014). The new rules codified in the directive in general are seen to be an important improvement to the way insurance regulation is handled in the European Union. Rae et al. (2018), for example, have recently argued that Solvency II currently is one of the most sophisticated regulatory regimes in the world. Doff (2016) has also noted that Solvency II is a major step ahead comparing the new rules with to the previous supervisory framework for insurance companies in the European Union. However, there are also some difficulties with the new regulatory regime. Classifying the papers that discuss the problems of Solvency II there has been general criticism and there have been suggestions to make improvements with a focus on quite specific questions (see, for example, on the one hand Huerta de Soto, 2009 and on the other hand Eling and Pankoke, 2014). Linder and Ronkainen (2004), for example, have highlighted a number of points where further work to improve Solvency II could be needed. This paper focuses on the handling of sovereign credit risk of government bonds (see, Basse et al., 2012 and Ludwig, 2014). In view of the investment policies of insurance companies this is an essential question (see, amongst others Nouy, 2012 and Swarup, 2012). In fact, Martin (2013) has stressed the important role of interest rate risk for deriving the solvency capital requirement in the context of Solvency II. More specifically, we use techniques of time series analysis and examine 30 year bond yields in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Given that long-term fixed income securities are an important asset class for European life insurers (see Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al., 2019) the empirical evidence reported here is of high relevance examining possible problems of Solvency II. As a matter of fact, other empirical studies until now have focused on shorter maturities analyzing the relationships among interest rates in different countries of the European Monetary Union. Gruppe et al. (2017), for example, have surveyed this literature. Moreover, it has to be noted that this paper is also motivated by Ashby (2011) who has argued that insurance regulators should try to learn from the recent banking and financial crisis by analyzing its causes and consequences. Indeed, this information could help to improve the effectiveness of the solvency regimes in the financial services industry.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 first briefly discusses how Solvency II is supposed to work and then highlights the specific problem examined here in some detail. The 3rd section focusses on methodological issues and also introduces the data examined.

In ====, ==== suggest that the payment may induce subjects to frame the intended prohibition as a permission in exchange for a price. Obviously, the effect if confirmed may impact almost any form of public regulation or contract drafting. May fines charged for plastic bags in fact increase usage? May penalty clauses in contracts increase the likelihood of breach?====Our study tests this theory, distinguishing it from six alternative crowding-out mechanisms and from confounds in Gneezy and Rustichini’s original day-care study.====In our experiment, subjects are offered a contract to perform a real effort task. Subjects are paid upon the acceptance of the contract. If they breach the contract, they keep their payment, but burden their partner with an additional workload. We vary our treatments by specifying different amounts that subject need to pay if they do not perform: T1 specifies no payment, T2 stipulates a low fine disproportional to the extra workload imposed, and T3 stipulates a proportional fine; the payments go to the contractual partner.====We find the same mean performance level across all three treatments. However, splitting the sample according to the subjects’ social value orientation reveals a strong crowding-out effect in the pro-social group and an offsetting price effect for the pro-self players.====Our last treatment, T4, aims to identify the mechanism behind this crowding out effect. In this treatment, the payment is made to the experimenter, instead of the contractual partner as under T2 and T3. In the absence of a transfer between the parties, T4 forces subjects to view the fine as a penalty, instead of an exchange. Results show that T4 crowds in the pro-social subjects’ compliance, providing causal evidence for the Fine-is-a-Price hypothesis.","A fine is typically imposed to reinforce an obligation by raising the cost of its violation. Consider, for example, a fine for smoking in restaurants. We can distinguish two categories of costs that a smoker may incur for smoking: the moral cost associated with breaking the norm (==== feeling guilt about violating the smoking ban) and the monetary cost imposed by the sanction. Classical economic theory would predict that the imposition of the fine increases the total cost of smoking (adding the monetary cost to the moral cost); at a higher total cost, the activity level of the forbidden behavior should decrease.====Classical theory, however, does not consider the potential interplay between monetary and moral costs. The imposition of a payment may induce smokers to reframe the norm and interpret it as a ==== in exchange for a price instead of a prohibition. In this case imposing a payment may instead reduce the size of the moral cost and possibly also the total costs.====Often referred to as a ====, this phenomenon may impact almost any form of public regulation or contract drafting. Consider a recent hospital reform in Denmark that imposed fees on hospitalized patients once their treatment was completed. While the sanctions intended to free up more beds for needy patients, Holmås et al. (2010) showed that patients stayed even longer. We may similarly wonder whether fines charged for plastic bags in fact increase their usage or whether the use of penalty clauses in contracts backfires to increase the likelihood of breach.====This crowding out effect is the core insight from a widely known and critically discussed study by Gneezy and Rustichini (2000). Gneezy and Rustichini conducted their study in for-profit day-care centers in Israel. Parents had been arriving late to pick up their children, burdening the centers. Using a within-subject design, the authors first conducted a baseline condition that did not charge payments for late pick-ups. In a subsequent treatment, the parents learned that the day-care centers had introduced a monetary payment of 10 NIS for late pickup.====In contrast to the predictions of classical economic theory, introducing the monetary payment led to an ==== of late arrivals, suggesting that the framing of a monetary payment can affect whether people perceive a norm as a prohibition reinforced by a penalty, or as a permission that grants them a service in exchange for a price.====We will refer to the possibility that a payment may reframe a prohibition or an obligation as a permission as the ====. To reconstruct this hypothesis in behavioral terms, we assume that, when weighing the benefits of coming late against arriving on time, parents face two costs: (1) the monetary cost ==== referring to the payment charged for arriving late, and (2) the moral cost ==== experienced when parents violate the norm obliging them to be on time. The total cost for a parent is ====, where we introduce the weight ==== to allow for type heterogeneity: a purely self-interested parent cares only about her own benefit and has ====; parents with higher weight ==== face higher moral cost for violating their obligation and imposing an extra burden on the day-care centers.====If the monetary transfer between parents and centers reframes the norm as a permission, the payment may crowd out the moral cost ==== and instead of increasing it reduce the total costs ==== of arriving late. An exchange may further require some reasonable transfer equivalent to the work day-care centers have to invest: If the payment is either disproportionally low or high, it may not be viewed as a price. Thus, ==== may not be crowded out when ==== is disproportionally small or large.====The fine-is-a-price hypothesis, however, is just one plausible interpretation of the evidence that Gneezy and Rustichini presented. We will analyze several alternative crowding-out mechanisms that too can explain their findings. Moreover, unrelated to crowding-out, several confounds associated with the natural imperfections of the day-care center’s field setting could also account for their findings. The main contribution of our experiment is to investigate and distinguish these different alternative mechanisms and confounds. Our results provide qualified support for the fine-is-a-price hypothesis.====Our experiment finds no overall crowding-out effect. Instead, crowding out seems to depend on subjects’ social value orientation. Dividing the participants into pro-social and pro- self types based on their social value orientation scores, we find (i) a strong crowding-out effect for pro-social subjects who reduce their performance, and (ii) an offsetting price effect in the group of pro-self subjects, who increase their performance to avoid the payment. The crowding-out effect does not depend on the reasonableness of the price; even a small monetary payment crowds out the moral motivation of the pro-social types. Whether the crowding-out effect dominates the price effect of the payment may thus be a function of the particular composition of the population that the norm addresses. The more pro-social a population, the more likely it is that the payment will primarily cause crowding out of moral motivation. The regulatory context may thus play an important role in what reaction the imposition of a fine may cause. For example, the context of day-care centers may be more likely to cause people to act pro-socially and therefore trigger stronger crowding-out than a social domain involving less personal relationships and repeated social interactions (for example, corporate settings).====Our paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 analyzes six alternative crowding-out mechanisms and the confounding factors specific to Gneezy and Rustichini’s day-care center study. In Section 3, we describe our experimental design that avoids the confounds of the day-care study. In Section 4, we present our findings that establish the crowding-out effect and demonstrate the importance of subjects’ social-value orientation scores.

Depending on how deterring enforcement is various degrees of compliance with the law will arise in equilibrium. For an agency that targets a certain compliance rate more resources per firm should be allocated to ==== with strong demand and high costs for adhering to ====. Whenever some degree of non-compliance among competing firms can be expected, more inspection resources are needed in markets where products are highly differentiated and/or the number of firms is small.","Firms often have incentives to behave opportunistically in relation to stakeholders, in particular when costs can be saved. Cheap but dirty production technologies impose externalities both locally and globally. Workers may be harmed by insufficient safety standards at the workplace, and food processing firms and restaurants may put consumers at risk whenever hygiene is unsatisfactory. In most countries various inspection agencies strive to ensure that firms adhere to standards specified by a regulator, e.g. environmental standards, workplace safety standards and hygiene standards. These standards often have the form of absolute limits or thresholds that result in fines when violated.====Hitherto, most inspection models have assumed myopic behavior by firms and focused on the incentives for unilaterally breaching legislation. This study develops a framework for the strategic interaction of firms that decide between adhering to and violating a standard specified by a regulator. Firm behavior depends not only on penalties but also on other firms’ responses to regulation, in particular the number of competitors that choose to be compliant. The main contribution of our study is to provide a framework that allows for varying degrees of compliance as an equilibrium outcome among homogeneous firms.====As an illustration consider two symmetric firms engaged in Cournot competition that simultaneously choose between adhering to and violating legislation before determining produced quantities. Non-adherence is associated with higher profits, but also with the risk of being punished for breaching legislation. The following payoff matrix is generated by our model for two firms producing a homogenous good, where marginal costs equal ==== under non-compliance and ==== under compliance, ==== denotes cut-off demand and ==== denotes the expected penalty for non-compliance (Fig. 1).====It is easily verified that both firms being adherent is the only Nash equilibrium whenever ==== and that both firms violating the law is the only Nash equilibrium if ====. For ==== there exist two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: ==== and ====.==== Thus, the equilibrium non-compliance rate is zero when demand is weak, one-half at intermediate levels of cut-off demand and one if demand is sufficiently strong.====In the more general analysis below we apply the Häckner (2000) model of oligopolistic Cournot competition where the representative consumer's utility function is quadratic such that demand for differentiated goods is linear. We follow the approach by Oestreich (2017) and assume that firms have perfect information regarding market behavior. Firms thus react strategically in case one or several competitors save costs by violating the law. In contrast, the enforcement agency is assumed not to be able to observe market outcomes (which would allow it to infer non-compliance); in reality prices and quantities are determined by many factors and hence, it is very difficult for an agency to attribute them to non-compliance specifically.====The situation that we are modelling is based on the following assumptions. For firms adherence to the law by adopting the prescribed standard is associated with compliance costs, which for simplicity only affect marginal production costs. We thus consider any type of legislation that requires firms to remove undesirable results of the production process.====By allocating more resources to inspections and enforcement the probability that non-compliance is detected and punished increases. The punishment for breaching the law does not include compensations for violations and solely consists of a monetary fine, which is fixed, such that each firm's choice is binary; either it incurs all compliance costs by fully adhering to the regulator's standard or it saves these costs by being fully non-compliant. In this study we evaluate how the incentives for breaching legislation and equilibrium outcomes are affected by the following characteristics:====The level of compliance costs depends on several factors, e.g., access to technologies and the requirements of legislation. From a policy perspective it is therefore of particular interest to interpret the compliance cost level as a measure for how tough laws are, thereby making it possible to draw conclusions regarding the effect of implementing stricter legislation.====In line with Becker (1968) all firms abide by the law if the expected penalty for breaching legislation is sufficiently large, and no firm is adherent if the expected penalty for breaching legislation is sufficiently small. At intermediate expected penalty levels we end up with both compliant and non-compliant firms in equilibrium. Basically, the inspection and enforcement authority can target any degree of compliance by varying inspection intensity. Not surprisingly, a firm's gain from violating the law and hence, the inspection intensity required to deter a firm from switching from adherence to violation of the law is larger the higher is the share of compliant competitors.====In terms of the effect of market characteristics two fairly intuitive results are obtained, independent of the degree to which competitors adhere to the law. The incentives to breach legislation are stronger the larger are compliance costs and the higher is demand for differentiated goods.====When it comes to market concentration and product differentiation predictions are not as straightforward. The incentives for unilateral cost reductions are pretty well understood from previous studies, see e.g. Häckner and Herzing (2012) in an environmental inspection setting and Belleflamme and Vergari (2011) in the context of unilateral incentives to innovate. Restricting attention to the more realistic scenario where ==== degree of non-compliance among competing firms can be expected, we reach a clear-cut and policy-relevant conclusion. Incentives to breach legislation are strongest when competition is weak, either because products are differentiated to a large extent or because the number of firms is small.====Most models of environmental inspections and enforcement deal with the interaction between an inspection authority and inspected firms. In particular, the focus is often on firms’ responses to the inspection agency's actions, for example, avoiding detection of non-compliance (Malik, 1990, Heyes, 1994, Innes, 2001) or contesting fines for violations (Nowell and Shogren, 1994).====Another strand of the literature addresses the issue of how an agency optimizes its inspection strategy vis-à-vis these firms, e.g., to minimize environmental impact or to maximize social welfare. Some studies aim at determining optimal regulatory policy given a budgetary constraint, e.g., Cason et al. (2016), Gilpatric et al., 2011Gilpatric et al. (2011) and Oestreich (2015). Bayer and Cowell (2009) focus on the implementation of different audit rules in a context where tax compliance is affected by the strategic interdependence of homogeneous firms that compete in quantities. Firms first decide how much to produce of a perfectly substitutable good and then choose how much profit to declare after having observed gross profits in the market; by evading taxes firms incur a cost and also face the risk of having to pay a fine. It is shown that market structure influences tax enforcement as market decisions as well as compliance behavior are affected. Oestreich (2017) examines optimal audit mechanisms for environmental taxes in a setting with homogeneous firms. Firms have perfect information regarding emissions, whereas the enforcement agency has to base its auditing decision on submitted emission reports. In both Bayer and Cowell (2009) and Oestreich (2017) the compliance decision is a continuous variable, such that equilibria are symmetric, in contrast to our model where heterogeneity among homogeneous firms might emerge when these face a binary choice regarding adherence to an absolute standard. Bontems and Bourgeon (2005) as well as Macho-Stadler and Pérez-Castrillo (2006) focus on how environmental regulation is optimally implemented when firms are heterogeneous and hence, can be targeted individually.====Naturally social norms can play a role in determining compliance patterns. It might be less stigmatizing to violate a standard when a lot of competitors do the same. Such links open up for the possibility of multiple equilibria (see, e.g., Lai et al., 2003), but will not be taken into account in our study. Rather, we focus on how a single firm's incentives for compliance is influenced by its competitors’ choices in the absence of normative considerations.====In many inspection models firms are distributed over a continuum measuring, for example, compliance costs or the detectability of violations of the law. Typically it is also assumed that markets are perfectly competitive, implying that cost savings from non-compliance increase a firm's profit, but do not affect market prices and market shares. In contrast, our model has homogenous firms, but takes into account variations in the degree of competition across markets, such that breaches of legislation not only lead to cost savings, but also impact on the strategic interaction with competitors. Although firms are homogenous, ex post heterogeneity is generated whenever equilibria with both compliant and non-compliant firms arise.====The paper is organized as follows. In the next section the basic model is presented. ***Section 3 provides model solutions and demonstrates how the equilibrium degree of non-compliance is determined. In ***Section 4 we analyze how the incentives to violate legislation are influenced by compliance costs and market characteristics.

The tortfeasor’s investments in undertaking the intentional act and the victim’s investments in precautions against the harm arising from the act are likely to be socially wasteful. Further, especially in the case of battery, the benefit of committing the intentional act will generally fall short of the loss to the victim. For these reasons, it makes sense to impose liability on the tortfeasor for the full loss experienced by the victim of an intentional tort. This deterrence theory requires that intentional tortfeasors are sensitive to liability exposure. To test this assumption, we examine changes in state-level homicide rates in response to caps on non-economic damages in tort. We find that murder rates increase by more than 5 percent when states adopt caps on non-economic damages.","Since at least Landes and Posner’s (1981) article, law and economics scholars have viewed liability for damages arising from intentional torts in a deterrence framework. Given the overlap between intentional torts and crime, this approach is not surprising. From an efficiency perspective, the activities that fall within both the crime and intentional tort categories, are likely to be socially wasteful, or, at least, we might want to induce a potential criminal/tortfeasor to bargain with his intended victim to ensure that the intentional act only occurs when the benefit to the criminal/tortfeasor exceeds the loss experienced by the victim. Further, as Tullock (1967) pointed out, the investments made by the criminal/tortfeasor to undertake the intentional act and any precautions undertaken by their victims will be socially wasteful. Efficiency, then, calls for full liability for all of the harms arising from intentional torts so as to deter the acts in the first place.====However, as with any deterrence based argument, a necessary assumption for the legal system to achieve these efficiency ends is that criminals/tortfeasors are aware of and sensitive to the penalties they face. In a standard Beccaria/Bentham/Becker type model, the relevant penalties can be criminal, civil, or both. While the sensitivity of individuals to criminal penalties has been studied extensively, much less has been done on the civil side. To the extent anyone has examined the empirical effect of civil liability on individual behavior, the focus has been entirely on unintentional or accidental harms.====We examine the sensitivity of individuals to liability for intentional torts by analyzing how the murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate changes when tort liability exposure is exogenously lowered by the adoption of caps on non-economic damages in tort litigation. If these caps are binding, and individual behavior is responsive to liability exposure, we should see an increase in intentional tortious acts when caps are adopted.====We find that when non-economic damage caps are adopted, the state murder rate increases proportionately by more than 5 percent, and this effect is statistically significant. Although there is no obvious story why tort reforms would be endogenous to changes in the incidence of murder, our result could be coincidental to unobserved variation within states over time. However, we show that while we observe the statistically significant increase in murder rates when states pass damage caps that include intentional acts, we do not observe the decline in states that adopt other kinds of liability caps, such as those that exempt intentional acts or those that are specific to medical malpractice. This finding increases our confidence that the effect we find is causally related to the change in liability exposure. Our confidence is bolstered by the fact that we find no effect on assault rates and property crime rates (while both of these categories do include tortious acts, the damages involved in these categories will almost always be well below the level set by damage caps). We also find no systematic effect on suicide rates. Further, we also provide evidence that the effect we identify is larger when tortfeasors are more likely to have assets at risk.====Our results add to the notion that criminal and tortious behavior is sensitive to expected costs and penalties. That this effect would be present in the tort context is potentially surprising given the growing consensus in criminology that certainty and celerity are necessary for punishments to generate deterrence. Given that the tort system is relatively slow and haphazard, our results raise some doubt regarding that consensus.",Deterrence and liability for intentional torts,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301393,4 July 2020,2020,Research Article,124.0

This was the surprising finding in Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini, “A Fine is a Price” published in the Journal of Legal Studies in 2000. In this field experiment at Israeli daycares, the introduction of fines caused an increase in late pick-ups by parents. The study has been frequently cited, especially for its suggestion that a fine can act as a price for non-compliance that “crowds-out” social norms and motivations for individuals.====In this article, we conduct two related studies to explore the robustness of Gneezy & Rustichini’s findings and the relevance of their suggested explanations. We seek to replicate their results using experimental surveys administered on MTurk, an increasingly common methodology in empirical legal studies, psychology and economics. While not an exact replication, it allows us to control aspects of the experimental design that are difficult to replicate in the field. We are also able to directly investigate whether fines persistently change the way respondents perceive the consequences (signaling, completing the contract) or relevant social motivations (crowding-out), as suggested by Gneezy & Rustichini. In the first study we translate the original daycare field setting into a vignette-based experimental survey. Our second study similarly investigates the effect of introducing a fine on income ==== reporting compliance – an example suggested in the original study. In both studies, respondents are randomized into experimental conditions exposing them to one of two alternate fines or a social norm-based measure. We solicit multiple compliance measures for respondents along with measures of the importance of the alternate explanations to their decisions.====Our survey results do not replicate the original findings. In both our daycare and ==== studies, the introduction of fines causes respondents to reduce non-compliant behaviour. Respondents expect others to behave similarly. Fines do not cause respondents to adjust their concerns about an incomplete contract consistently with Gneezy & Rustichini’s theory. They also show very little evidence of fines crowding out social motivations, despite being responsive to our social treatments. The effects of fines on outcome behaviours and respondents’ reasons are transitory. Once the fines are removed, our respondents return to their baseline behaviours. The survey results are consistent with intuitive judgments (and standard rational-choice theory) that fines deter. A survey is not a field experiment; however, our results suggest that more research is required to understand when and how any “fine is a price” effect may arise.","Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini published “A Fine is a Price” in the ==== in 2000.==== The authors used a randomized field experiment at Israeli daycares to test whether “when negative consequences are imposed on a behaviour, they will produce a reduction of that particular response.” Instead of validating this standard assumption in psychology, economics, and legal studies, the authors found that introducing a fine ==== late behaviour in their experiment.====Gneezy & Rustichini offered two possible explanations – both of which involved the fine transforming parents’ perceptions of the context. The first explanation was that the fine provided information about the consequences of coming late that had been unspecified in the contract between parents and the daycare. While parents may have previously feared severe consequences from coming late, introduction of the fine made it clear this was not a threat.====Gneezy and Rustichini offered another powerful explanation: before the fine existed, a social norm restrained parents from coming late. Once the fine was introduced, it transformed the parents’ perceptions of the extra care into a commodity. They were now free to consume it at the “price” of the fine, without the guilt or shame felt when transgressing the social norm. Parents’ internal, moral motivations were “crowded out” by the market signal sent by the fine. Gneezy & Rustichini’s experiment has been widely accepted as support for this latter, intuitively appealing theory. The paper has been cited more than 2000 times including in popular non-fiction for general audiences.====Gneezy and Rustichini’s social norms explanation fit well with emerging developments in economic theory that expanded standard approaches to individual preferences. Theorists developed models for individual preferences that reflected altruism and other-regarding behaviour, drawing on empirical support from standard economic games.==== Another strand of emerging theory developed models of preferences dependent on reference points, providing a related theory of how a shift in behaviour might occur.==== Scholars also provided models and empirical evidence consistent with individuals behaving differently in contexts perceived as social as opposed to market exchanges.====Despite these developments, questions remain about the extent to which social norms influence choices in economic environments and whether fines “crowd out” the effects of norms, as Gneezy and Rustichini suggested.==== Most relevant for our project, there has been some criticism of Gneezy and Ristichini’s original field study==== and the authors themselves suggested potential benefits from replication, even undertaking their own follow-up study.====Given the significant influence of the original paper and the importance of the prospective behavioral insight it uncovers, we believe it is a good candidate for a form of replication study. However, in the case of field studies like Gneezy and Rustichini’s original, faithfully reproducing the full set of underlying conditions embedded in the social and temporal context for the field experiment is challenging. This would make it difficult to view any inconsistent result as a true failure to replicate. For empirical work that is inherently contingent on complex background factors such as legal institutions, culture and political conditions, we suggest that a “many studies”==== approach as a way to test robustness of the underlying mechanism may be more appropriate than strict replication. Empirical work and results like this are perhaps best conceptualized as an ongoing project that inherently involves the collaboration of a community of researchers. The creation of a body of related work will ground confidence in the insights and an understanding of their limits.====With this approach in mind, we conduct a number of related studies to explore the robustness of Gneezy & Rustichini’s original results. We transform the original daycare field setting into a vignette-based experimental survey administered on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. This approach allows us to control aspects of the experimental design that are difficult to replicate in the field, and to directly investigate the alternative explanations Gneezy and Rustichini offered for their original results. We also test for evidence of the underlying mechanisms they identify in a tax compliance setting – an alternate context where Gneezy and Rusitchini suggested the “fine is a price” effect could appear. Survey-based research in empirical legal studies has grown, particularly as accessibility through online platforms such as MTurk has expanded.==== We seek to replicate Gneezy & Rustichini’s famous result with this increasingly common approach. While our study is thus not a direct opportunity to confirm or refute the original field trial findings, we hope to provide evidence relevant to their generality and contribute to the emerging literature employing MTurk in empirical legal studies, psychology and economics.====Our survey results do not replicate the original findings. In our daycare and tax studies, the introduction of fines causes a reduction in anticipated non-compliant behaviour by our survey respondents. Moreover, subjects anticipate that other respondents will be similarly affected. Fines do not cause subjects to adjust their concerns about an incomplete contract in a manner that is consistent with Gneezy & Rustichini’s theory. They also show very little evidence of fines crowding out any social norms. Moreover, the effect of fines on outcome behaviours and the reasons behind the outcomes of our respondents is transitory. Once the fines are removed, they return to their baseline behaviours. These survey results are consistent with our intuitive judgments (and standard rational-choice expectations) that fines deter.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce our primary replication of Gneezy and Rustichini’s daycare study.

On net, alarms provide benefits to communities, but 94–99 percent of police responses to alarms are to false activations. Solving the false alarm problem could free up the resources equivalent to 35,000 U.S police officers. Response to false alarms is a private good while response to an actual crime is a public good. The paper analyzes a Public-Private-Partnership policy called Verified Response (VR) where the initial response is usually provided by private security under a competitive setting, and police respond only if a crime is verified. A case study of Salt Lake City, Utah is conducted using synthetic control methods to evaluate this program. The introduction of this policy is associated with an 87 percent annual reduction in police alarm response calls, a 26 percent reduction in burglaries, and faster response to all police calls. The paper relies on ==== to explain why this solution is not adopted in the majority of cities.","An expansion in private security services has been observed since the 1960s in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands, among other countries. (See for example Van Steden and Sarre, 2007; Provost, 2017). Increases in private security yield a decline in various types of crime (e.g. Zimmerman, 2014). In particular, greater use of private security has been shown to reduce various property crimes, including burglary, without causing spatial spillover of such crimes (Meehan and Benson, 2017). In the US, Canada, and the UK, police respond to burglar alarm activations. In the US, these responses comprise 10–20 percent of calls to police, and each call involves 911-dispatcher time of approximately 11 min. Physical police response is usually by two officers for 20 min, and in total encompass an estimated 10–20 percent of urban patrol officer time. This occurs while 94–99 percent of these activations are false, resulting from user and technological errors.==== The false alarm problem is typical of countries with electronic alarms. For example, in a UK study, 30 percent of alarms were triggered by insects and 10 percent by pets (Ransome-Croker, 2018). The annual estimated police cost of false alarm response in the US was $1.8 billion in the early 2000s, or the equivalent of 35,000 police officers (Blackstone et al., 2005). In 2016, the estimated cost of police response ranged between $75 and $160 per response (Goldfine, 2016).==== Responding to false alarms generates small social benefits while generating opportunity costs in terms of police time and resources.====Numerous policies have been implemented to address false activations with limited lasting success. These policies include educating repeat activators, collecting fixed or escalating fines for repeat false activations, ceasing police response after a set number of false activations, and even imposing criminal charges on repeat activators (Blackstone et al., 2005). However, regardless of such actions, the rate of false activations remains well above 90 percent (Blackstone et al., 2005; Sampson, 2007). False response to burglar alarms is typical of emergency calls for fire and ambulance services, and solutions could be applicable to them.====This study focuses on a policy solution called Verified Response (VR). VR requires physical or visual verification of an actual or attempted penetration before police are dispatched. Alarm owners designate individuals, including themselves, or private response companies to examine the premises in person, or using cameras and smartphones to check it visually.====We first present false alarm statistics from cities that have implemented VR over the past two decades. A case study of Salt Lake City (SLC) then analyzes the effectiveness of VR. Detailed data on police response time were provided by the City’s police department, which made such analysis possible. We employ a synthetic control model to estimate the impact of VR on the annual levels of burglary and police alarm response in SLC. This approach constructs counterfactual trends of the burglary and alarm response numbers in SLC under the assumption that VR was never introduced and compares those numbers to the actual statistics. This is accomplished by collecting data from a selection of cities with similar characteristics to SLC, which do not have VR. This appears to be the best approach given the limited nature of the data among cities, which have adopted VR. In fact, among cities that have adopted VR, only SLC data were available at this level of detail and for a sufficient time to evaluate the impact of VR.====This paper introduces a good whose nature, whether public or private, is revealed only when the service is completed. The paper empirically analyzes whether police response to false alarms entails opportunity costs in delivering other public security services. Hence, we investigate whether police alarm response impacts police response to all emergency calls including crime related calls and whether this situation is an efficient use of police resources.====Section 2 presents the background of the burglar alarm industry and the source of the false response problem, as well as the impact of VR on adopting cities. In Section 3, we analyze the public and private characteristics of police response to burglar alarm activations. Section 4 presents the SLC, Utah case study, while Section 5 analyzes the synthetic control estimation.

From a database of 2000 decisions from French Courts of Appeal, we show that the gender composition of panels of judges have a significant effect on the amounts of child support. More specifically, our results show that panels composed of three female judges set higher child support amounts than mixed panels, regardless of the gender of the creditor. In addition, the diminishing effect of the panel’s gender mix is particularly pronounced when the creditor is a man and the mixed panel is composed of two women and one man.","There is an extensive literature in law and economics, criminology and political science on the impact of judges’ personal characteristics on the decisions they may make (Kulik et al., 2003; Schanzenbach, 2005; Collins and Moyer, 2008; Bonneau and Rice, 2009; Curry, 2009; Glynn and Sen, 2015; Lim et al., 2016; Boyd, 2016). These studies cover judges of lower courts as well as those of higher courts (courts of appeal or supreme courts). In particular, ethnicity and gender have been largely studied, always in the same way: in an American legal system characterized by an over-representation of white males among judges, the issue is to investigate whether and to what extent a judge who belongs to a minority, in terms of gender or ethnicity, produces decisions that differ from those of a white male judge (Harris and Sen, 2019).====With respect to the specific impact of a judge’s gender, research has highlighted that it may have an effect on decisions (Songer and Crews-Meyer, 2000; Tiede et al., 2010; Collins et al., 2010; Scheurer, 2014, Bielen et al. 2017) but that it may also differ according to the gender of the parties involved in the conflict (Schanzenbach, 2005; Martin and Pyle, 2005; Boyd and Nelson, 2017; Philippe, 2020). These differences are manifest only in litigation where women might feel more concerned than men, such as cases of harassment or discrimination.==== One may consider that union breakdown cases involving the determination of child support are another area where the judge’s gender is likely to matter. Indeed, it can be presumed that judge’s gender could have an impact on issues related to union breakdowns involving children because judges are likely to have different positions according to their gender and to the gender of the creditor of child support. This hypothesis is in line with several empirical results (Martin and Pyle, 2005; Fuszara, 2003; Junqueira, 2003; Bourreau-Dubois et al., 2012).====Most studies about the impact of the judge’s gender on decision-making focus on the U.S. legal system. Conversely, very little research has been done on this subject in civil law countries. One possible explanation lies in the difference between the two types of legal culture. As Schultz and Shaw (2013) explain, in common law countries the judges “act as anonymous interpreters of the law according to specified interpretation rules and pass judgments in the name of the state or the people” (p. 6). Such a system does not leave room for discussion about the influence of judges’ characteristics on judgments. Additionally, there is a strong ideology of judicial neutrality in civil law systems. For instance, according to Boigeol (2013) the question of the gender of the judge is not an easy topic to approach, “as the first reaction of judges is always to reject the assumption that there might be any correlation between gender and judging” (p. 140). On the other hand, in common law countries, judges “have greater discretion in reaching their decision by ‘distinguishing’ the case in hand from precedents. They ‘make the law’. The judgment is therefore more closely connected to their personality” (p. 6). It is therefore unsurprising that most empirical studies on this issue focus on the common law system, and more particularly on the United States. However, in several judicial fields, civil law judges have significant discretion, leaving room for the possible influence of their characteristics on their decisions. In France, this is the case, for example, when it comes to determining child support award, especially in absence of guidelines.==== Consequently, the French judicial system leaves room for judicial discretion. Besides, civil law judiciaries are largely feminized, unlike in the United States where women are still under-represented among judges. This demographic specificity reinforces the interest of studying the impact of judges’ gender in civil law countries and refreshes the way this issue is addressed, since women judges are in the majority.====The goal of this paper is to study whether the gender composition of a panel of three judges affects judicial decision-making in a civil law system where women judges are in the majority. To this end, we focus on the determination of child support amounts by French panels of judges, using a database of 2000 collegial decisions made between May 2006 and January 2010 in French Courts of Appeal. Our study joins previous analyses on collegial court decisions that seek to measure the impact of gender in panel judicial decision-making (Farhang and Wawro, 2004; Peresie, 2005; Boyd et al., 2010). However, our article departs from these studies in one significant respect. Previous studies examine how the gender of judges sitting on appeal affects their individual decisions, controlling for the gender composition of the panel, in cases where they have to vote in favor of the plaintiff or the defendant. In the French judicial system, the panel decision-making process is an oral collective deliberation without a formal vote. Given this procedural specificity, what interests us is whether the gender composition of a panel affects the collective decision taken by that panel in setting child support.====The article is structured as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the institutional framework of our study. In Section 3 we provide a brief review of the literature explaining whether and why male and female judges would decide differently and whether the judge’s gender has an impact in a collegial decision-making process. Section 4 describes the data and presents some descriptive statistics. Section 5 outlines the empirical methodology. The results are presented in Section 6 and discussed in Section 7. Section 8 concludes.",Does gender diversity in panels of judges matter?

These costs affect the likelihood of dissent in different and complex ways.","In collegial courts, judicial disagreement is inevitable. Legal systems address the possibility of judicial disagreement in a variety of ways. Early in its history, the Supreme Court of the United States replaced the traditional seriatim decision (in which each Justice enters her own opinion) with the current system of an opinion on behalf of the entire court with the opportunity for separate opinions (concurrences or dissents). In the United Kingdom, judges in the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords historically issued their decisions seriatim, a practice picked up by the new Supreme Court (Raffaeli, 2012). By contrast, in the French ==== deliberations are made secret by law and there are no dissenting opinions.==== Many other courts have mixed practices whereby dissents are allowed, but efforts are routinely made to find common ground and achieve consensus, as described in a media quote for the specific case of the Supreme Court of Argentina (====).====It is a widespread characteristic that high courts are collegial in their nature of entertaining litigation under appeal. As they have increased responsibilities in error correcting and lawmaking, they tend to have more members than lower courts. Moreover, court decision is the outcome of collective deliberation. In effect, the specialized literature points out that a larger number of judges should improve accuracy in adjudication (Good and Tullock, 1984; Posner, 1985; Kornhauser and Sager, 1986; Shavell, 1995). Yet their collegial nature, together with the distinct role of high courts in any given legal system (addressing primarily points of law rather than assessing facts), seems prone to a degree of internal judicial disagreement. At the same time, there are norms of consensus in all legal systems (Gerber and Park, 1997). Too much disagreement is intuitively dysfunctional and excessively costly. So, within an efficiency theory of court norms, some pressure for consensus is clearly rational.====Jurisdictions around the globe (and across time)==== have different approaches towards disagreement within a court. While the practice of producing and publicizing dissents is extended across common law countries, the tradition in civil law jurisdictions was to prohibit dissenting opinions (Fon and Parisi, 2006). Still today, in the case of the Belgian Court of Cassation or the Italian Constitutional and Cassation Courts, publishing individual views of judges made in secret deliberations constitutes a criminal offense (Raffaeli, 2012).====When dissents are allowed, judges must decide whether or when to write them (Wood, 2012). This depends on a set of determinants, including limited resources, extent of the disagreement, internal practices of the court, and working environment. Rational dissent theory (Epstein et al., 2011; Fischman, 2011; Edelman et al., 2012) explains these determinants with a model of self-interested federal judges who enjoy life tenure. In this model, as judges make the decision whether or not to dissent, they trade off their desire for leisure and good collegial relations with their aspiration for a good reputation and their willingness to express their opinion to influence the law.==== As a result, judges may choose not to dissent even if they do not share the opinion of the majority. Epstein et al. (2011) refer to this as ""dissent aversion"". Tests of rational dissent theory have shown that the probability of dissent is influenced positively by the ideological differences among judges (Epstein et al., 2011), the number of judges in the court or panel (Hazelton et al., 2017), and the importance of a case (Epstein et al., 2011); and negatively by the size of the caseload (Epstein et al., 2011) and by sociodemographic variables (for example, whether judges work in the same city; Hazelton et al., 2017).==== Others have emphasized other costs generated by dissenters, such as the harm they may cause to a court's perceived legitimacy or reputation (Stack, 1996).====While the main insights of rational dissent theory have been documented and corroborated in several studies, there has been much less empirical testing on how different types of dissent may affect the likelihood of dissent. Dissents in more salient cases, or more forceful dissents, may have stronger legal effects than dissents appearing in less relevant cases or very narrowly constructed dissents. Our article aims to fill that gap in the literature by seeking to isolate varying levels of appeal intensity and types of dissents in the Supreme Court of Argentina.====The Supreme Court of Argentina is a collegial high court with discretionary appellate jurisdiction. It reviews constitutional and federal questions potentially impacting many other cases==== as well as due process adjudication (whose effects are restricted to the appeal at stake). In addition, the Court issues rulings on appeal’s admissibility and on the substance of the case within the same decision. These special features allow us to identify different types of dissents (for example, certiorari denied or boilerplate dissents vs reasoned dissents) as well as cases with different level of importance (for example, federal or constitutional appeals versus due process violations).====In contrast to common wisdom and previous empirical literature, our main finding is that more important cases have a lower likelihood of carrying a dissenting opinion. Yet, when we breakdown dissents by type (that is, reasoned dissents versus boilerplate dissents), we find that majority decisions carrying dissents tend to be longer, but only in cases of reasoned dissents. Furthermore, we show that reasoned dissents are more likely to occur in important cases, suggesting that Justices choose to exert the effort needed to produce a reasoned dissent when the potential net benefits are higher, for example, in terms of legal aspiration. Overall, our study highlights that not all dissents should be treated alike as different types of dissent carry different levels of collegial and effort related costs. These costs affect the likelihood of dissent in different and more complex ways than previously anticipated.====The paper proceeds as follows.

Employing count data models that account for overdispersion and/or excessive counts of zeros, this paper assesses the unintended consequences of enforcing stricter gun control laws and the effects of gun ownership on homicide organ donor supply in the United States using county data for the period 2009–2015. The findings confirm the transplantation paradox hypothesis that stricter gun control laws reduce the expected cases of gun homicides and thereby reduce deceased organ donor supply and exacerbate the organ shortage. The findings are robust to several measures of the strength of gun control laws, restricted samples and spurious outcome variables. However, the direction of the impact of gun ownership levels on homicide organ donor supply proved to be inconclusive.","The likelihood of dying under circumstances that would render an individual's organs suitable for transplantation is very low. Estimates show that the probability that an individual in the 18–79 age group will become a potential donor at some point during her lifetime is 0.0028 (Howard and Byrne, 2007). The period that leads to organ recovery from a deceased individual is extremely complex and layered. Although there are exceptions (e.g. non-heart beating donation), the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain including the brain stem, known as brain-death, is a prerequisite for deceased organ donation. The determination of brain death and therefore the identification of a potential donor is typically contingent upon the individual to go through a cerebrovascular injury (i.e. stroke, aneurysm), severe oxygen deprivation or a severe head trauma (i.e. motorcycle crash, gunshot wound) that otherwise leave visceral organs free of physical damage. Setting aside medical compatibility and consent issues, victims of fatal motor vehicle accidents (MVA), fatal firearm incidents and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) are therefore suitable donor candidates.====The controversy is that some of these circumstances leading to the death of the individual do not occur naturally and can be prevented by large-scale policy interventions. Examples include mental health parity laws that provide insurance coverage for mental health treatment (Lang, 2013), state motorcycle helmet laws that aim to reduce crash fatalities due to helmetless riding (Peng et al., 2017) and gun control laws that aim to reduce gun-related fatalities (Lee et al., 2017). None of these interventions intend to affect organ donor supply. However, the requirement of the death of an individual in such a way that would render her organs suitable for donation to save someone else's life represents a public health paradox and these large-scale policy interventions might have the unintended consequence of reducing an already low organ donor supply (Annas, 1988). On p. 621, Annas (1988) notes:====Since the likelihood of brain death is higher for individuals who are exposed to severe head trauma and the declaration of brain-death is a prerequisite for most cases for deceased donor organ recovery, the unintended consequence of such regulations is that they might also reduce the pool of organs available for transplantation. Therefore regional variation in the strength of gun control laws may affect organ donors from victims of homicide if variations in homicide rates significantly impact the supply of homicide organ donors. Employing count data models that account for overdispersion and/or excessive counts of zeros in the data, this paper assesses such unintended consequences of enforcing stricter gun control laws on deceased donor supply in the United States for the period of 2009–2015.====The findings confirm the transplantation paradox hypothesis: stricter gun control laws reduce the expected cases of gun homicides and thereby reduce deceased organ donor supply and exacerbate the organ shortage. The findings are shown to be robust to interchangeable measures of the strength of gun control laws and to the restriction of the sample to (large) urban counties. Robustness checks also show that gun control laws are not related to the supply of donors who die in circumstances other than homicide and provide further support for the estimates.====Section 2 briefly reviews prior literature on gun control and the impact of legal interventions on organ donation; Section 3 invokes negative binomial (====) and zero-inflated negative binomial (====) models to account for overdispersion in homicides along with excessive counts of zeros in homicide organ donor supply data and Section 4 reports the results. Section 5 performs a robustness check to provide support for the effect of gun control laws and gun ownership on homicide organ donor supply by assessing whether gun control laws and gun levels are unrelated to the supply of donors who die in circumstances other than homicide. Section 6 assesses the limitations of the analysis and suggests avenues for future research.","State Gun Control Laws, Gun Ownership and the Supply of Homicide Organ Donors",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820301381,9 June 2020,2020,Research Article,131.0

The empirical results reveal that securities fraud scandals cause affected companies to lose a substantial portion of their market value under this legal regime. In particular, companies lose around 12% of their market value immediately after they issue a typically vague statement about a potential financial irregularity problem. Also, the magnitude of the market reaction to this statement appears to be an accurate predictor of the seriousness of the scandal, which negatively associates with the holdings of shares owned by the CEO.","How to minimize securities fraud has been a contentious topic for decades. To begin with, we need to design an optimal legal regime that can appropriately sanction wrongdoers while minimizing social costs. Despite some important drawbacks, many commentators believe that the class action is the most effective means to deter securities fraud. Thus, some countries like Korea and China decided to choose the same path. However, the overlooked Japanese experience tells a different story: a regulatory regime that empowers public enforcement, without class action litigation, could also make public companies suffer substantial reputational cost from the securities market.====The Japanese regulations addressing fraudulent disclosures were initially modeled on the U.S. codes. Nevertheless, similar to the situation in the U.S., these regulations went unused for decades. This is not to say that there was no securities fraud. The laws went unused because individual investors’ damages as a result of fraudulent disclosure were not large enough to offset the cost of bringing an individual civil suit. It is widely understood that an effective disclosure enforcement regime should address both the compensation value and the deterrence value; and this system did neither. Recognizing the failure of this system, the U.S. response was to adopt a class action mechanism to attract lawyers to serve as the watchdogs of the securities market. Yet this approach is plagued by a severe side effect – that is, frivolous litigation. In contrast, Japan decided to take its own initiative and design a public enforcement-centered mechanism to enhance the supervision of public companies. Therefore, the case of Japan presents a natural experiment in regulating against securities fraud without resorting to class action and the problems it entails.====Adopted in 2004, the new Japanese legal regime relies on the Securities Exchange Surveillance Committee [the SESC] to detect fraudulent disclosure and impose administrative sanctions; in addition, the reforms established a strict civil liability==== for issuers combined with a quasi-out-of-pocket damage rule to compensate aggrieved investors. Even though the amount of this administrative monetary sanction by the SESC is not large, public enforcement still plays a key role in this system because the SESC administrative sanction decision opens a door for investors to claim compensation for fraudulent disclosure through the newly reformed civil litigation. In other words, the SESC administrative sanction decision lowers the cost of individual civil litigation. The deterrent effect of this legal regime can be explained in two ways. First, due to the harsh civil liability set by the new rule, this legal reform enables significant public awareness of securities fraud scandals, which have become one of the most severe types of scandal for public companies after 2004. Second, public pressure is enhanced by legislators, who expect public companies involved in fraud scandals to punish the responsible insiders. However, whether this system achieves an appropriate level of deterrence has not been explored until now. This article fills this gap.====For a long time in the law and economic scholarship, the reputational loss has been viewed as an important sign of deterrent to public companies (Klein and Leffler, 1981; Shapiro, 1983). Also, measuring the stock price movement after a particular event is one of the most common ways to manifest reputational loss (Karpoff et al., 2005). Therefore, this research uses the impact on the securities market, which are securities market price reactions to securities fraud scandals, to measure the consequences of securities fraud under this newly reformed legal regime. Of course, findings of this research are not direct deterrent measures of the legal system. However, the more significant the loss in market value after fraud comes to light, the larger the deterrent effect should be expected under this legal regime.====This paper analyzes all of the fraudulent disclosure cases that have resulted in sanctions by the SESC until 2018.==== There are a total of 101 SESC enforcement decisions and 99 corporations in the data set. The typical fraudulent disclosure case in Japan has eight stages: (1) first news about the scandal; (2) self-investigation reports issued by a company-hired special committee; (3) stock exchange sanctions; (4) the company’s reaction to the scandal; (5) SESC sanctions (administrative penalty or criminal liability charges); (6) delisting of the issuer; (7) civil litigation brought by investors; and (8) bankruptcy of the issuer. This research investigates which stages cause a negative impact on the securities market – in other words, how companies lose their market value due to the securities fraud scandal.====Quantitative analysis of market price reactions around each stage reveals that stages (1) first news about the scandal, (3) stock exchange sanctions, and (5) SESC sanctions give rise to statistically significant negative market reactions. Specifically, public companies lose on average about 12% of their market value right after the first news of the scandal, which usually comes in the form of a vague statement by the company indicating the possibility of a financial irregularity problem. Also, outcomes such as criminal liability charges against insiders, stage (6) delisting, and stage (8) bankruptcy are associated with a larger negative market reaction to the stage (1) first news about the scandal than others. Third, the bigger the CEO’s ownership share, the larger the negative market reaction to the first news of the fraudulent disclosure.====The paper proceeds as follows: Part I discusses the background and features of the Japanese securities disclosure enforcement regime.

Implementing country-fixed effects OLS regressions, we find that the European Commission’s (EC) releases of the excessive deficit procedure significantly affect yield spreads. The EC releases of higher debt and better budget balance forecasts contribute to the rise and the decline of spreads, respectively. Moreover, we find that the announcements of the ECB’s key interest rates together with the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and the first covered bond purchase programme (CBPP1) negatively affect sovereign yield spreads in our sample of EMU countries. There was also some capital market mispricing of the sovereign bond risk in the Euro area before the Global Financial Crisis, notably regarding government debt forecasts.","The economic literature suggests that government’s borrowing costs depend on the fundamental economic conditions, particularly the fiscal stance and key macroeconomic developments (see, e.g., Poghosyan, 2014).==== There seems to be a great deal of understanding that an under-pricing of sovereign risk in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) occurred before the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (see e.g., Gibson et al., 2014; Basse et al., 2018). In contrast, the period that followed this event, particularly during the economic and subsequent sovereign debt crisis that took place, an general overpricing of risk was observed in many countries (Gibson et al., 2014).==== Such developments were caused both by the fluctuations in the risk appetite and by Euro area country-specific concerns regarding underlying economic fundamentals.====Therefore, the successful elimination of fears of a looming Eurozone break-up following the GFC, can be partly attributed to improvements in economic fundamentals (particularly in periphery European countries) (Muellbauer, 2014).==== This suggests that economic announcements (which often include release of new economic projections and/or announcements of (fiscal or monetary) policy decisions by EU institutions) are an important source of information, containing news that typically spills over internationally across markets, affecting sovereign bond yields (Andersen et al., 2006). To the extent that fundamentals are well captured by forecasts produced by official (and/or private sector) agencies, the release of such forward-looking views on an economy’s performance can affect yields by offering market participants valuable insights and by shaping their expectations on potential portfolio returns.====Rational investors absorb and incorporate all the available information at their disposal in real-time, meaning that there are no information rigidities, thus a release of new information will cause a rearrangement in their investment portfolio. A forecast revision in a positive and desirable way (e.g. higher GDP growth, lower public debt, lower unemployment, etc.) should bring the sovereign yields down, as more investors are interested in buying bonds of this country due to the lower risk of default. The same would be true of a positive assessment of the EC relative to a Stability and Growth Program of a given country. In addition, monetary policy events, typically the ECB’s conventional and unconventional monetary policies, would also play a role in the development of sovereign yield spreads, directly or indirectly either via changes in the aggregate demand or via changes in the fiscal behavior.====In this paper, we study the impact of macroeconomic, fiscal and monetary developments and well-defined events on sovereign bond yield spreads in 10 EMU countries. Such developments cover the European Commission (EC) releases (twice a year until autumn 2012 and three times a year afterwards) of short-term economic forecasts for the member states of the EMU. This is a natural and legitimate avenue of research that has been somewhat neglected in the literature in the sense that most papers have not look closely at the role played by different types of forecasts (see Section 2 for details). We consider one source for macroeconomic and fiscal expectations: the EC’s forecasts.==== Additionally, we have collected information on the EC’s announcements regarding the excessive deficit procedures (EDP) that contains information regarding the adoption of appropriate policy responses to correct excessive deficits and/or debts by the member states. Moreover, we study the impact of the monetary policy events such as the announcements of the ECB’s interest rates together with the announcements of unconventional monetary policy on the sovereign bond yield spreads of the sample countries.====We contribute to the literature notably by: i) constructing a set of fiscal events, type 1 and type 2, related to the EC announcements of fiscal developments and excessive debt procedures related decisions in 10-Euro area countries; ii) conducting an identification and analysis of conventional and non-conventional monetary policy events; iii) assessing the impact of fiscal and monetary policy events on 10-year sovereign bond yield spreads; iv) considering both core and non-core EMU countries in the effects of different policy instruments in their spreads; v) inspect the impact of the GFC with a before-and-after analysis====This paper also fits well within the literature addressing the interconnectedness between banks and governments, particularly in the context of the EMU with many direct state interventions and bailouts following the unfolding of the crisis (some important references include e.g., Ejsing and Lemke, 2011; Ludwig and Sobański, 2014; Gibson et al., 2018, and Wegener et al., 2019). Moreover, it is a study relevant for the field of law since this paper’s results can help the discussions on the proper (optimal?) handling of sovereign credit risk under Basel III, notably in the aftermath of the GFC.====Our main results show that the ECB’s key interest rates announcements mainly the deposit facility, main refinancing operations and marginal lending facility rate tenders, negatively affected the bond yield spreads of the sample countries. Moreover, the announcements of the nonstandard measures of the ECB notably the first covered bond purchase programme and the longer-term refinancing operations contributed to decreasing the spreads. Regarding the impact of the fiscal policy events, we found that the EC releases of the economic forecasts on government debt and budget balance contribute to increase and decrease the spreads respectively. The EC releases of the excessive deficit procedures (EDP) contribute in reducing the yield spreads.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. The following section presents the empirical methodology and describes the data used. Section 4 discusses the main empirical results and includes several robustness checks and sensitivity analysis.

Within this exploration, the study pursues two research objectives. First, it discerns the separate effects of punishment certainty and punishment severity on compliance decisions; this task is generally difficult especially since it requires constructing measures of the beliefs held by individuals or regulated businesses. Second, the study compares the two effects. The study’s most important contribution is to investigate these two issues using stated choice scenarios posed to environmental management professionals working at businesses operating within the Clean Water Act regulatory framework. Results reveal that regulated facilities respond to increases in fine size and fine likelihood with equal sensitivity.","This study explores the role of enforcement in explaining management choices tied to regulatory compliance. Within this exploration, the study pursues two research objectives. The first objective is to discern the separate effects of fine likelihood and size on compliance decisions. The second objective is to compare the two effects. While both topics are understudied, the most important contribution is to investigate these issues using the decisions of actual environmental management professionals. Specifically, the study analyzes data collected from U.S. chemical manufacturing facilities whose wastewater discharges are regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA). This sector generates a significant proportion of CWA discharges and has received special scrutiny from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in recent years.====Deterrence stemming from the enforcement of laws, including both criminal laws and regulations imposed on businesses, is based on two components of expected penalty imposition – likelihood and size – according to the standard model of enforcement. The likelihood of a penalty reflects the certainty of punishment; the size of a penalty reflects the severity of punishment. Discerning the effects of these two components on behavior, however, is difficult because it requires constructing measures of the beliefs of individuals and businesses regarding the expected penalty likelihood and size. Since the two components are frequently correlated with each other, it is even more difficult to isolate the two components’ effects in order to assess their relative influences. While several empirical studies attempt to assess the relative influences of these two factors (e.g., Eide, 2000), no consensus yet exists and studies of regulatory enforcement examining this topic are scarce. A better understanding is important for policy considerations since enforcement agencies should place greater emphasis on the more effective tool – monitoring, which relates to the certainty of punishment, or sanctioning, which relates to the severity of punishment.====The current study contributes to our understanding of the deterrence generated by increases in penalty likelihood and size in three key ways. First, rather than exploring the contrast between penalty likelihood and size using observed behavior, this study analyzes stated behavior generated from hypothetical scenarios presented within a survey to facilities regulated under the U.S. Clean Water Act. By appropriately varying the levels of penalty size and likelihood, the study determines the absolute and relative degree of responsiveness to each deterrence component. Thus, the study explicitly controls the values of fine likelihood and fine size within these scenarios. Second, the current study examines the influence of penalties in an enforcement context where very few facilities ever receive penalties.==== Thus, use of the hypothetical scenarios improves the generalizability of our results as they do not rely on a very small sub-set of facilities. Third and most important, in our survey of regulated facilities, we pose scenarios to environmental management professionals working at these regulated facilities. We structured the hypothetical scenarios to mimic actual situations in which these environmental professionals may respond to enforcement. This structure further adds to the generalizability of our results because they are based on the responses of professionals who make environmental management decisions on a daily basis.====To deliver these contributions, the current study builds on the analysis of Earnhart and Friesen (2013) who examine specific deterrence using survey data. They provide links to the behavioral economics literature and identify facility characteristics that relate to specific deterrence. The current study builds on Earnhart and Friesen (2013) by examining managerial responses to varying levels of enforcement likelihood and magnitude. Both studies examine the same survey dataset. The current study examines two additional scenarios presented to the surveyed managers.====Results demonstrate that facilities are equally responsive to increases in the likelihood or severity of a fine. Importantly, this lack of difference does not stem from any failure to estimate tightly the two individual effects of fine likelihood and fine severity.====These results help to contribute to the current debate over environmental enforcement. This debate involves key components of environmental enforcement: deterrence-based versus cooperation-based enforcement, capacity of social norms to promote compliance, roles of different non-regulatory actors (e.g., civic groups), use of different procedural enforcement mechanisms, impact of agency discretion, and use of criminal enforcement against those who intentionally violate environmental laws (Glicksman and Markell, 2018; Vandenbergh, 2017).====Consistent with these debate points, the EPA has been re-shaping its environmental enforcement in attempts to expand compliance with environmental laws over the past few years. Under the second term of the Obama Administration, the EPA promoted the Next Generation Compliance initiative (Glicksman and Markell, 2018). This initiative addressed noted weaknesses in foundational components of EPA’s mission by incorporating into its enforcement program various mechanisms and tools for deployment by multiple entities, e.g., environmental non-governmental organizations (Glicksman and Markell, 2018).====Under the Trump Administration, the EPA recently re-formulated its efforts to increase compliance through enforcement. On August 21, 2018, the EPA transformed its “National Enforcement Initiatives” into “National Compliance Initiatives”. These initiatives are part of the EPA’s efforts to increase the “environmental law compliance rate and reduce the average time from violation identification to correction” (EPA, 2019). Enforcement helps to achieve these EPA goals. The initiatives’ new name conveys the “overarching goal of increased compliance” and how enforcement fits within the “full range of compliance assurance tools”, which includes compliance assistance and self-audits, while formal enforcement addresses “serious noncompliance” and creates “general deterrence”.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

Evidence provides an imperfect representation of facts, and procedural rules constrain a court's ability to draw inferences from the evidence produced by the parties or to acquire additional information. In each given case, the court decision is almost certainly different from the true value of the dispute. In many cases, court errors tend to favor parties with unmeritorious cases for the simple reason that if the value of a litigant's case is low or, in the extreme, close to zero, mistakes can only favor him or her. As a result, courts may typically overvalue unmeritorious claims and undervalue meritorious ones. Since plaintiffs filing unmeritorious cases stand to gain from inaccuracy—if compared to plaintiffs with meritorious claims who, instead, most likely lose out—inaccuracy distorts incentives for primary behavior and opens the door to frivolous litigation. Anticipating that they will receive more than their fair share, plaintiffs may file unmeritorious lawsuits to obtain, in expectation, unfairly large judgements or settlements.====We consider a simple setup aimed at capturing these effects of court inaccuracy and investigate under what circumstances shifting the costs of litigation can be remedial or, conversely, detrimental. In particular, in our model the court is asked to determine the plaintiff's share of a contested asset (or, by simply reversing the reasoning, liability). This setup matches various typologies of cases involving divorce, inheritance, partnership dissolution, apportionment of damages, determination of relative fault, and many other common instances, and can be extended to include any court determination of value or damages between a maximum and a minimum. A ==== case is one in which, if all facts were known to the court, the plaintiff should receive a large share of the asset (or a large damages award); conversely, ==== cases are those in which the plaintiff should receive a low share (or low damages). In principle, there would be nothing problematic about plaintiffs filing unmeritorious lawsuits if courts valued them accurately.====In reality, however, a court does not have all the relevant information. Consider a limit case in which the plaintiff files a suit with very little merit: the share the plaintiff should receive is close to 0. Since the court decision is bounded below at ====, court errors can only favor the plaintiff, so that it is reasonable for the plaintiff to expect that he or she will either receive ==== or be lucky and pocket a relatively large amount. (The opposite would be true in a meritorious where the share the plaintiff should receive is close to 1.) Averaging over all cases, the court's judgment may well be unbiased but it will be inaccurate in virtually all individual cases (even in cases that are not so extreme as those in the example). This discrepancy may result in a mispricing of externalities and have negative effects on incentives for primary behavior.==== In addition, with inaccurate courts, the plaintiff will file a lawsuit whenever the expected judgment is larger than his or her share of the costs of litigation even in cases when these costs are greater than the judgment that a perfectly accurate court would issue. These lawsuits are deemed to be “frivolous” and, according to most commentators, should be discouraged.====Fee shifting is seen as a way to combat this problem. Policymakers==== and the Supreme Court of the United States have recently called for giving courts more discretion in shifting fees to the losing party==== and for giving weight to the merits of the losing party's case when exercising their discretion.==== Yet, there is little in the literature to suggest that making it easier for courts to shift costs to the loser will improve the accuracy of justice and reduce the incidence of frivolous litigation without discouraging parties from filing valuable claims or defending against abusive ones.==== In the extant literature, courts are given no role when it comes to fee shifting. Theoretical analyses focus almost exclusively on variations of the American rule, which does not shift costs, and the English rule, which makes the loser invariably foot the full bill. In such frameworks, fee shifting depends only on which party prevails at trial.==== This common rendering does not allow the modeler to modulate the role of the court and does not do justice to how fee shifting is administered by courts. Real courts decide on the merits and then, separately, determine who pays the court fees. As far back as in ancient Athens, the losing party was subjected to a penalty only when failing to secure a minimum number of favorable votes by the jury, which indicated that the case was patently in favor of the winning party. Similarly, modern courts in most countries determine fee shifting case by case, based on how clear the parties’ merits appear to be.====We study the effect of fee shifting on the overall accuracy of adjudication and settlements. In the model, two parties litigate on how to divide an asset of common value. The quality of the case is known to the parties but not to the court. There is two-sided asymmetric information about the evidence held by each party.==== The parties first try to settle the case and, if they fail, go to trial and submit evidence to the court, which adjudicates the case and may shift fees to the loser. We underscore the critical role of evidence production by the parties and evidence evaluation by the court: in line with how courts behave in the real world, courts in our model shift the fees if the evidence against the loser is sufficiently accurate. The American rule is an infinitely cautious rule, under which evidence is never considered accurate enough for the court fees to be shifted; at the other extreme, under the English rule fees are invariably shifted to the loser, even when the evidence is not very accurate. In between, we characterize a family of rules that give varying weight to the accuracy of the evidence.====We then study how fee shifting can improve the accuracy of adjudication by removing the loser-advantage in frivolous lawsuits and hence price claims correctly. We show that the American rule performs better if litigation costs are high, while the English rule performs better if litigation costs are low. The reason is that, if litigation costs are high, fee shifting can overshoot and create a winner advantage. This result rationalizes the observed patters of reliance on fee shifting in Europe—where litigation costs are low and fee shifting is common—versus the United States—where litigation costs are high and fee shifting is rare, suggesting that each system may have adopted the fee-shifting rule that maximizes the accuracy of adjudication.==== If the whole continuum of fee-shifting rules is considered, most commonly an intermediate rule—under which costs are shifted only if the accuracy of the evidence is above a threshold and which is much more common than the pure English rule—is better than the two extremes. These findings suggest that fee shifting in American courts should be advocated with some caution.====Fee shifting increases the costs for plaintiffs to bring cases with low merits while also increasing the costs for defendants to defend against cases with high merits. Hence, fee shifting tends to filter both low- and high-merits cases out of the dispute resolution system; the first because plaintiffs will not file, the second because defendants will concede immediately to the plaintiff's demands. This effect has implications for the types of cases that courts will adjudicate under different fee-shifting rules and, consequently, might affect judicial lawmaking. In particular, courts in the United States operating under the American rule might see a broader and more extreme array of cases as compared to courts in Europe, which use fee shifting more often. This feature might in turn be important in a common law jurisdiction because it allows courts to see a more representative sample of all disputes.==== In addition, this result might provide a reason for why cases adjudicated in American courts tend to make news because of their extreme outcomes more often than cases in Europe: European courts may simply be adjudicating a more balanced pool of cases due to the ex ante effects of fee shifting on the incentives to file.====Finally, our model produces ancillary results. We show that, conditional on filing, neither the quality of the case nor fee shifting affect the probability that the parties settle the dispute. The first result is intuitive: the quality of the case is known to the parties and hence only affects the settlement amount, not the probability of settlement. The second result is not a trivial one, even though it is well known that fee shifting does not affect the settlement rate when there is uncertainty about the amount of the judgment. The common rationale is that in this case the parties know how the court will allocate the court fees.==== This explanation, however, cannot be used in our model because we allow fee shifting to depend on evidence privately held by the parties, which injects uncertainty into the allocation of court fees.==== To delve into the reason for our result, we provide a mechanism-design analysis of our model (which is fully discussed in the Online Appendix). We show that the optimal direct-revelation mechanism, which maximizes the probability of settlement, requires that the allocation of the court fees does not change continuously with a party's evidence but might jump discontinuously at certain thresholds. This feature may be referred to as “flatness” of the fee-shifting rule and guarantees that the settlement rate is invariant to fee shifting. If this is not the case, then fee shifting discourages settlement.==== While confirming the traditional results about the effects of fee shifting on the settlement rate, our approach generalizes them to cases in which the parties are uncertain about the fee-shifting outcome.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our two-sided asymmetric information model of litigation and fee shifting. Section 3 explains the equilibrium concept and our strategy to find the plaintiff's offer and the defendant's demand at the settlement stage. In Section 4 we solve the model and describe the parties’ behavior in equilibrium. After laboring through several cases, Section 5 shows that neither fee shifting nor the quality of the case affect the settlement rate. In Section 6, we discuss our main result about the effect of fee-shifting on the accuracy of judicial decisions and its implications for judicial outcomes, access to justice and case selection. We also report on a number of extensions, on the results of a mechanism-design exercise to investigate the scalability of our approach and, finally, on the role of our main assumptions in generating our results. In Section 7, we comment on the implications of our model.

Our empirical results from using the DCC-MIDAS methodology indicate that regulatory changes in Europe have created significant and negative impact on the long-run correlations within the month where the regulation is decided to be taken into action. This impact still remains in the following months and robust with respect to the trend component of the long-run correlations. A direct implication is that the more regulations the EU attempts to put in place, the lower the long-run convergence process of sovereign bond markets is. We then analyse the structural shifts in the long-run correlation dynamics with penalized contrasts methodology and try to find out the reasons of these severe changes. Accordingly, some of the structural shifts overlap with the dates of a limited number of regulatory changes, in addition to the major global economic and political events.","The European Union has witnessed substantial structural, regulatory and political changes in the past twenty years since the introduction of the euro. Much research has focused on the development of a broad convergence in the yields of European bonds after the development of a strong monetary union (Codogno et al., 2003, Kim et al., 2006, Christiansen, 2007). This is particularly important due to the broad diversification effects that existed through the creation of such a cohort of sovereign states, each offering quite unique strengths and skills to the union, with the smallest countries seeking added economic security through diversification, shared skills, experiences, financing sources, and the reinforced bargaining strength that was provided through such a large number of countries when negotiating international trade agreements. However, these countries also incorporated broad structural issues towards the European Monetary Union (EMU), manifesting in what can only be described as one of the worst sovereign debt crises taking place in countries such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Cyprus and Spain. Among these countries, both Greece and Ireland necessitated third-party financial support and intervention due to the deep-rooted nature of their sovereign banking crises.==== The development of the EMU has also withdrawn both monetary and many fiscal policy options as tools through which the crisis can be mitigated and alleviated. This was evident in the economic collapse of the countries denoted as ‘PIIGS’ as monetary policy had to be tailored to the needs of the EMU rather than the needs of specific nations.====The regulatory responses made by the European Union have been quite strong in the post-crisis era. Following the outbreak of the financial crisis, European regulatory reforms have focused on four key areas: (1) the strengthening of financial supervision; (2) the creation of tools to support bank recovery and resolution; (3) the creation of a more effective deposit protection system; and (4) the creation of an improved regulatory framework for banks, insurance companies, securities markets and other sectors. We must focus on analysing as to how these reforms have made the financial system more stable and resilient and as to whether they have influenced the perceptions of bond traders as measured by the yields of sovereign debt. Such regulatory restructuring necessitates re-evaluation of the many ways in which European corporations interact, particularly cross-border entities that are part of the same institution. Such reforms introduced after the crisis also need to be monitored to check whether they are delivering intended outcomes and to assess whether the new rules have any unintended consequences. Appendix A provides a detailed overview of the key completed reforms that have been introduced along with the rationale supporting their introduction.====Some of the earliest commissioned and now completed financial reforms include those related to the risk-based prudential and solvency rules for insurers (Solvency II), AIFMD, CRD III, the establishment of the European Supervisory Authority, deposit guarantee schemes, derivative reform through EMIR, the creation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), MIFID, and a wide range of market abuse and transparency reforms among others.==== The European Commission developed such reforms through the establishment of a number of policy advising expert groups,==== representing consultative bodies set up by the Commission to provide advices in relation to the preparation of legislative acts and policy initiatives usually composed of experts appointed by EU governments.====As far as the sovereign debt crisis is concerned, a common wisdom is that the regulatory changes affect the dynamics of sovereign risks and the ways the sovereign bond markets co-move over time. In this paper, we give a close look to this issue by considering a broad range of the European regulatory reforms as potential sources of changing time-varying bond market behaviour. We also devote our attention to some of the many significant political events that have occurred during the past twenty years in Europe as political developments in the European Union, which have been particularly extraordinary in more recent times, play a pivotal role on regulations. Corbet and Larkin (2018) briefly review these political shifts and show that the latter have developed within the widespread financial crises and been exacerbated in some states by the dramatic influx of illegal immigration. As a result, Europe finds itself at a crossroads inspired by political spectrum shifts to the left and the right, with fear, uncertainty fuelling nationalist revolt across a host of European nations. Such political shifts have also manifested in the nationalist-based decision-making resulting in the growth of right-based decisions such as the Brexit or the Italian budgetary issues witnessed in recent years. Much evidence has been provided that contagion effects exists in such political decision-making (Mei and Guo, 2004, Rajsingh, 2016). It is thus opportune to identify as to whether such political developments are a source of instability for time-varying sovereign debt instability, with further emphasis on the presence of contagion effects.====One of the key data through which we can identify both the severity and contagion effects of crises is through sovereign bond yields. Our research shifts attention to the long-run relationship of sovereign bond markets, instead of their divergence since the rapid development of both the European regulatory and political environments. In particular, our methodological choice focuses on the inherent time variations in such structural destabilizations, i.e., as to whether European sovereign bond markets experience long-term structural destabilization in the aftermath of changes in the regulatory and political environments. This builds on the work of Colacito et al. (2011) who introduced the DCC-MIDAS methodology to analyse the long-run correlation components between financial time series. According to our perspective, while political instability has quite strong theoretical grounding for producing influence on sovereign bond markets, it is very important to further understand as to whether financial markets themselves were in agreement with the European Central Bank's views that its regulatory actions were in fact fostering the resilient and sustainable development of Europe's financial landscape. Within this context, such regulatory intervention might be observed as beneficial to financial stability, but could also be detrimental to sectoral and regional profitability, growth and development.====According to our analysis, we contribute to the literature by showing that the regulatory changes in Europe have significant and negative impact on the long-run correlations of the sovereign bond markets of the major eurozone countries. These correlations also change drastically within the month where the regulation is implemented and this change is preserved within the following months, showing that effects of regulatory changes in the EU are not transitory and do sustain on the correlation dynamics of these sovereign bond markets. We check whether this finding is distorted by the trend components of the long-run correlations or not, and reveal that the results are robust. A direct implication and one of the main contributions of the paper is the finding that the more regulations the EU attempts to put in place, the lower the long-run convergence process of sovereign bond markets is. Next and as a robustness check, we focus on detecting potential structural shifts in the long-run correlations and examining whether they are associated with regulatory changes. By applying the penalized contrasts methodology of Lavielle (2005) to detect the change points, we show that the structural shifts in the long-run correlations occur around the times when major regulatory changes or important political events take place (such as the critical stages of the Brexit process), supporting our view that both political uncertainties and regulatory actions are drivers of the long-run relationship between the sovereign bonds of major eurozone member countries.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a concise review of the literature based on sovereign bond dynamics, structural changes in European regulatory dynamics and the influence of broad political events on financial markets. We provide a brief review of the DCC-MIDAS methodology in Section 3. Section 4 reports the data that we use and the corresponding empirical results.

Using a unique data set from Taiwan, we measured attorney experience by either the total number of civil cases they have represented from 2000 to 2014 or their number of years in practice. We argue that theoretically, there was hardly any case selection by litigants and litigators in Taiwan’s flat-fee attorney market. Combining these data with another unique data set we compiled from pain and suffering damages lawsuits regarding personal injury in weighted ordinary least squares models after full matching and coarsened exact matching, we find that experienced plaintiff attorneys claim more than inexperienced ones.","When you get involved in a legal dispute and the case is going to court, would you prefer hiring an experienced attorney to an inexperienced one? If yes, why? What is the added value of their experience? In the long debate on the issue of “have’s versus have-not’s” in litigation, the premise is that the have’s (i.e. the rich) are better able to mobilize litigation-useful resources, including hiring better attorneys (Huang et al., 2014; Boyd, 2015; Chen et al., 2015).==== From intuitions of ordinary people to the legal literature, the often implicit assumption is that experienced attorneys are better. Nonetheless, very few empirical works have been able to demonstrate the differences between experienced and inexperienced attorneys. Powered by a unique data set that contains detailed measures of multiple facets of the experience of all attorneys in Taiwan as of 2014, this article sets out to fill the gap in the empirical literature.====The legal issue that we use to examine the import of attorney experience is the assessment of pain and suffering damages==== for personal injuries incurred in car accidents. The effect of jurist experience can be better isolated when the judicial decisions are neither formulaic nor rule-based. Pain and suffering damages are highly discretionary in Taiwan,==== and thus judges may be affected by extra-factual factors, including attorney “manipulation”. Albeit discretionary, the amount of pain and suffering damages is to a certain extent predictable. Two prior empirical studies (Chang et al., 2015, 2017) have demonstrated that pain and suffering damages in Taiwan can be captured by regression models==== — this is important, as attorney experience would not matter if the amount of non-pecuniary damages were arbitrarily decided.====This streamlined setting is suitable for testing the effect of attorney experience, because attorneys’ political ideology can be ignored, as no well-established ideology champions either high or low pain and suffering damages. Granted, lawyer skills are not singular. Threading the statutory texts and judicial cases together to make an innovative and convincing argument is a hallmark of good lawyers. Nevertheless, this skill is largely useless in the assessment of pain and suffering damages. Here, the law is straight-forward, the assessment of pecuniary damages routine, and the assessment of pain and suffering damages highly discretionary. Thus, our findings regarding the effect of attorney experience are not readily generalizable to other legal contexts where statutory interpretation is critical. Yet, in terms of identifying the effect of attorney experience, perhaps it is better that the legal issue we will study enables us to ignore other aspects of attorney skills and focus on the added value of experience when attorneys makes numeric claims based on facts.====Using data matched on case characteristics, we find that senior plaintiff attorneys tend to claim higher amounts of pain and suffering damages. Several plausible explanations are offered and discussed: Senior attorneys are wealthier and thus see the value of limbs as higher; senior attorneys are less concerned with their winning record and more concerned with “winning the impossible” to justify their higher fees; and senior attorneys are knowingly exploiting the anchoring effect.====We study the amount of pain and suffering damages claimed by plaintiffs, not those adjudicated by courts. While the latter could be of more interest, we cannot use matching with our data to examine whether experienced attorneys’ higher claimed damages lead to higher adjudicated damages, as post-treatment variables on the defendants’ side (such as whether defendants are represented by experienced attorneys and how they respond to plaintiffs’ claims) are necessary to have balanced cases characteristics among the treatment and control groups, but post-treatment variables should ==== be used for matching.====The structure of this article is as follows: Section 2 lays out our research question in the context of the prior literature. Section 3 addresses the most critical question in our research design: whether there is a selection effect in the sense that senior attorneys receive stronger and bigger cases. Section 3 contends that theoretically, in Taiwan’s institutional setting, rational sorting of stronger and bigger cases to better or more experienced lawyers barely exists, but to make sure that the case characteristics are balanced among cases represented by senior and junior attorneys, we conduct full matching and coarsened exact matching. Section 4 provides an overview of the relevant law in Taiwan. Section 5 lays out our weighted OLS models.

This paper differs from prior research in several ways. First, this is one of the few studies to focus exclusively on youth firearm suicide rates. Second, this study uses one of the largest and most recent data sets of any study on this topic. Third, this study uses the synthetic control method, an empirical technique that has not been previously used to study this topic. Results are mixed. For nine states, introduction of CAP laws resulted in lower youth firearm suicide rates. In thirteen states, however, CAP laws had no significant effects on youth firearm suicide rates. Hence, CAP laws did not have statistically significant effects on youth firearm suicide rates for most of the states examined. Given these inconclusive results, more research is warranted in this area.","In 1981, the youth firearm suicide rate was 1.69 per 100,000 persons; in 2017, it was 1.27 per 100,000 persons, a decline of almost 25%. Although a variety of factors, including more prevalent use of gun locks and safes and better counseling services, may help explain some of the decline in firearm suicides among youths, it is possible that stricter gun control laws may also be partly responsible for this decrease in suicides.====One of the more relevant gun control laws is the Child Access Prevention (CAP) law. CAP laws impose criminal liabilities on adults who allow children to have unsupervised access to firearms. One of the primary reasons for implementing CAP laws is to compel parents or guardians to supervise children’s access to firearms in order to reduce the likelihood of potentially dangerous situations that may arise when children have unsupervised access to guns.====Although there is no federal CAP law, many states have enacted such laws. As of 2017, 27 states have enacted some type of CAP law. These laws, however, vary widely. Some impose a criminal liability when an adult does not secure a weapon. Others only prohibit an adult from providing a firearm to a child. Many of these laws also have varying definitions of what a minor is. In some states, adults must secure firearms from children who are at most 14 years of age; for others, the age at which supervision is required is as high as 18. Some states require secured access for all types of firearms; other states only require it for handguns. Finally, most states have exceptions for hunting, sport shooting, and other legitimate purposes. Table 1 lists those states that have CAP laws and the year when the law was enacted.====There has been much prior research on the effects of gun control laws on suicide rates (Hamilton et al., 2017; Gius, 2015, 2011; Webster et al., 2004; Conner and Zhong, 2003; Lott and Whitley, 2001; Marvell, 2001; Ludwig and Cook, 2000; Cummings et al., 1997; Leenaars and Lester, 1997; Carrington and Moyer, 1994; Lester, 1993; Kellerman et al., 1992; Yang and Lester, 1991; Lester, 1988; Sommers, 1984; Lester and Murrell, 1982, 1981). The results of these prior studies are mixed. Some find that stricter gun control laws reduce firearm-related suicide rates (Hamilton et al., 2017; Gius, 2015; Webster et al., 2004; Conner and Zhong, 2003; Marvell, 2001; Ludwig and Cook, 2000; Cummings et al., 1997; Leenaars and Lester, 1997; Carrington and Moyer, 1994; Lester, 1993; Kellerman et al., 1992; Yang and Lester, 1991; Lester, 1988; Sommers, 1984; Lester and Murrell, 1982, 1981). Other studies find either no significant relationship or an ambiguous relationship between suicide rates and gun availability (Gius, 2011; Duggan, 2003; Lott and Whitley, 2001; Marvell, 2001). When prior studies did find relationships between guns and suicides, the relationships tended to be weak and were typically overshadowed by the effects of socioeconomic factors. In addition, some studies found that stricter gun control laws increased non-firearm related suicides. Finally, many prior studies looked at overall suicide rates, and not just youth suicide rates, and most did not focus on gun control laws that would have had the most significant impact on youth suicides. The present study attempts to address these concerns with prior research in this area.====The aim of the present study is to ascertain the relationship between CAP laws and state-level youth firearm suicide rates.

Divergent dissent behavior of constitutional courts in Slovenia and Croatia, which emerged from a shared legal tradition, casts doubt on the validity of this view. We first clarify the countries’ common legal-historical legacy and identify salient post-Yugoslav between-country differences in party ====, a contextual factor previously shown to influence judicial outcomes. We next argue conceptually that, for a given legal tradition, greater party fragmentation increases the net benefits to justices from dissent. Finally, drawing on a newly-assembled micro-level dataset of constitutional court decisions in Slovenia and Croatia, we demonstrate that country-level party fractionalization is indeed an important determinant of judicial dissent. Our analysis thereby illuminates that underexplored contextual political factors may be no less relevant as a driver of dissent in the courts of law than the conventionally emphasized legal tradition.","Disagreement in collegial courts is inevitable. Accordingly, the question of why judges decide to issue separate opinions (concurring or dissenting) in some circumstances but not others has attracted considerable attention (Epstein et al., 2011), including within comparative legal scholarship (Entrikin, 2019). To explain variation in the formation and frequency of separate opinions in distinct jurisdictions, observers typically resort to explanations emphasizing differences in legal traditions. According to the prevailing view, cross-jurisdictional differences in the frequency of separate opinions arise because some legal traditions, in particular those based on common law, are inherently more inclined than others to promote judicial dissent (see, e.g., Raffaeli, 2012; Kelemen, 2013, 2018; Bentsen, 2018).====Explanations of comparative differences in dissent that emphasize the primary role of legal tradition, however, are problematic on at least two grounds. First, from the methodological standpoint, in a typical comparative setting, it is difficult to disentangle the contextual effect of legal tradition from the impact of the political processes and any other features of institutional design that can, in principle, shape the evolution of dissent. Second, and perhaps especially illuminating, as we demonstrate in the present article, it is possible to identify comparative settings where courts in different jurisdictions are grounded in the very same legal tradition, yet nevertheless exhibit notably different behavior with respect to dissent. At the very least, therefore, legal tradition is not unequivocally the most salient driver of judicial dissent.====To cast new light on the unsettled debate about the determinants of dissent in the courts of law, we provide an evidence-based comparative case study of the evolution of dissent in the constitutional courts of post-Yugoslav Slovenia and Croatia. These are two underexplored but, from the perspective of research design and the substantive issue at hand, especially pertinent jurisdictions. The neighboring Slovenia and Croatia are namely the only former Yugoslav republics that share not merely a common Yugoslav (socialist) but also a joint pre-Yugoslav (Habsburg) legacy. In addition, the two countries' constitutional courts emerged at a similar point in time, are based on a common (German) model, and adopted comparable procedures. Post-Yugoslav Slovenia and Croatia therefore provide a setting where, based on the arguments stressing the salience of legal tradition, we would expect the courts to exhibit very similar, if not identical, dissent behavior. Yet, as we show, this is decidedly not the case. Despite the shared legal tradition, the two constitutional courts are in fact characterize by notably different trends with regard to dissent: one of them (the Slovenian constitutional court) has featured a comparatively high dissent rate while the other (the Croatian constitutional court) has had a comparatively low dissent rate. By the very nature of our research design, legal tradition per se cannot explain the resulting divergence.====To understand the variation in dissent rates in Slovenia and Croatia, we focus on the role of party fractionalization, a contextual political factor previously shown to influence judicial outcomes and, at the same time, an especially striking point of divergence in the evolution of the two countries after the Yugoslav breakup and the accompanying fall of the socialist rule. To conceptually link dissent behavior in constitutional courts to party fractionalization, we draw on a principal-agent model of the judiciary (see, e.g., Garoupa and Ginsburg, 2015). We hypothesize that, for a given legal tradition, a more fragmented party system incentivizes constitutional court justices to issue more separate opinions. Intuitively, greater party fragmentation increases the net expected benefits to justices from dissent because a more pronounced heterogeneity of political beliefs not only lowers the costs of signaling diverse preferences, but also elevates future career prospects, increases the value of appealing to the general public, and raises the benefits from creating one's own legal legacy.====We then subject our conjecture to empirical scrutiny. To this end, we contrast newly-collected micro-level data on dissent in the constitutional courts of Slovenia and Croatia with data on the evolution of party fractionalization in the respective countries following their independence. Controlling for a plethora of case and court level covariates, as well as additional contextual factors that could plausibly influence constitutional court behavior, we demonstrate that variation in party political dynamics is indeed an empirically a robust predictor of judicial dissent. At the same time, we find only limited evidence of the relevance of alternative accounts, including conventional individual rational-choice explanations and the influence of international courts. Our results thus elevate the hitherto neglected role of contextual political factors as a driver of judicial dissent independent of any potential effect of legal tradition.====Our article contributes to and connects multiples strands of the literature on judicial dissent and constitutional court behavior. In the US context, studies of dissent in courts of law examine both the federal judiciary and state supreme courts and stress the importance of political, economic and social explanations. The resulting research on predictors of dissent has highlighted the importance of judicial background and court heterogeneity, workload pressure, mechanisms of judicial selection, and opinion writing procedure (Jaros and Canon, 1971; Brace and Gann Hall, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1995; Epstein et al., 2001; Boyea, 2007). Interestingly, while state-level party competition has been found to influence aspects of judicial behavior (such as voting on death penalty cases), it is not an empirically salient determinant of dissent in the U.S. context.====Outside the US, explicitly comparative studies of judicial dissent are scarce. Scant existing contributions (see, e.g., Kelemen, 2013, 2018; Bricker, 2017) do not consider the role of country-level political fractionalization as a potentially important determinant of constitutional court dissent.==== A few handful of analyses of post-communist judiciaries investigate the impact of political fragmentation on aspects of constitutional court behavior, including the extent of judicial activism (Smithey Ishiyama and Ishiyama, 2002; Herron and Randazzo, 2003; Bumin, 2017).==== These contributions, however, do not focus on constitutional court dissent as the outcome of interest. We bridge these different strands of research by exploring a comparative setting particularly suitable for examining the effect of contextual political dynamics and by emphasizing the importance of political fractionalization as a hitherto empirically underexplored principal-agent driver of constitutional court dissent.====Based on the epistemological approach, our article is related to recent research on the relative importance of immutable historical legacies versus government-promulgated policies for long-run development. Within a subset of the literature pertinent to this debate (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2001; La Porta et al., 2008), the prominence of colonial heritage—both with regard to the style of colonization and the legal origin of the colonizers―has been emphasized ""to the point of exclusion of almost all other factors"" (Henry and Miller, 2009: 266). In a similar spirit, the relevance of legal tradition may have been over-accentuated in the comparative legal scholarship as an explanation for dissent-related behavior in the courts of law. Much like Henry and Miller (2009) demonstrate the vital importance of macroeconomic policies for comparative development by contrasting Barbados and Jamaica, two jurisdictions with a common colonial legacy but vastly different macroeconomic policies, we illuminate the salience of contextual political factors as an unexplored driver of constitutional court dissent by utilizing the example of Slovenia and Croatia, two jurisdictions stemming from a shared legal tradition but with distinct post-independence contextual political dynamics. More generally, Henry and Miller (2009) and our analysis illustrates how careful comparative case studies that hold constant the role of conventionally emphasized factors, but highlight the role of other, generally neglected, factors, may help advance scholarly understanding of prominent economic and legal phenomena.====The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the arguments emphasizing the role of legal tradition for judicial dissent and clarifies the benefits from further research based on carefully chosen comparative studies. Section 3 offers a background on Slovenia and Croatia, focusing on the similarities and differences pertinent to the study of the two countries' constitutional courts. After arming the reader with the relevant institutional detail, in Section 4 we elaborate on how and why a close examination of the comparative setting of Slovenia and Croatia can improve our understanding of constitutional court dissent, and in particular the role of contextual politics in that regard. Section 5 introduces our data, develops our empirical strategy, and presents and discusses our results.

How much value does the latter effectively add? In this paper we propose a methodology to address this question: we compare the specific contents of collective agreements (except minimum wages) to their equivalent norms set by statutory law (if any). We illustrate this approach by analysing in detail over 400 norms from six collective agreements in Portugal and then comparing them to the country’s Labour Code. We find that as many as 59 % of those collective bargaining norms are exactly or virtually equal to the Labour Code; only 27 % (an average of 16 norms per convention) are more favourable for the worker; and 11 % (8) are more favourable for the employer. We conclude that collective bargaining in Portugal has a relatively small role as an effective source of ====. We also present several potential explanations for our findings, including the wide range of statutory law.","Collective bargaining – the negotiation between employers and workers on working conditions applicable in one or more firms – is a critical dimension of labour markets and labour law of several developed countries. Its importance follows from the fact that, in comparison with individual negotiations, collective bargaining may represent a significant increase in workers’ negotiation power, leading to significant improvements of their wages, working time and various other dimensions of the employment relationship. Collective bargaining may thus be particularly important at times of increasing wage inequality, declining labour shares and a decoupling between productivity and wages.====Of course, the positive aspects of collective bargaining are not limited to workers. From the employers' point of view, collective bargaining may also have multiple benefits, including the promotion of greater stability and predictability in the operations of firms, with higher levels of effort and engagement from workers, resulting in increasing productivity and profitability. Transaction costs related to asymmetric information and holdup effects may be reduced through collective bargaining. In other words, collective bargaining may not only redistribute income between productive factors – and promote a greater balance between them – but also lead to the growth of the incomes of all parties involved. Such ability of collective bargaining to increase the productivity of companies is a key driver of its success or lack thereof.====On the other hand, several potential negative effects of collective bargaining are relevant. These include the weakening of the link between productivity and wages in companies (notably in collective bargaining of sectoral level and in times of low inflation); and the protection of the interests of employees represented by unions (especially in the public sector and in industries with high product market rents) to the detriment of unrepresented workers and their employment opportunities.====It is important to note that the working conditions applicable in each country result not only from collective agreements in force, but also from statutory labour legislation, adopted by the country’s legitimate legislative bodies. In contrast to collective bargaining, that tends to promote the differentiation of labour conditions according to the characteristics of each company or sector, statutory labour law implies a large deal of harmonisation of labour conditions across the country, in all sectors of activity and a potentially slower adjustment process in face of changing circumstances.====This duality between statutory law and collective bargaining deserves attention in the legal and economics literatures – and in the policy debate – as it can generate important effects. In fact, it is not possible to understand the economic and social impact of one dimension without taking into account the other as they can interact in important ways. For example, national normative frameworks in which statutory legislation is more comprehensive may lead to a reduction in the regulatory space available to collective bargaining and its actors.====To the best of our knowledge, in this paper we are the first to examine this issue – the interaction between statutory labour law and collective bargaining. We use an innovative but also simple methodology, whereby we conduct a detailed comparison between the contents of a number of sectoral collective agreements and the applicable statutory labour legislation, considering the same working conditions in the two cases.==== Our perspective is multi-disciplinary, based on labour economics and labour law.====This approach allows us to ascertain what is the effective value added that follows from collective bargaining – what it changes in the employment relationship in relation to what is established in the base (statutory) legislation. We also seek to promote a debate about the advantages and disadvantages of different combinations between these two sources of labour law, based on different potential weights of each one in shaping overall working conditions. This evidence is also of use for studies that wish to analyse the effects of collective bargaining minimum wages and may need to disentangle those from the working conditions in collective agreements.====Our empirical evidence is focused on the case of Portugal, a country where collective bargaining agreements cover approximately 90 % of employees. Although union membership in the private sector is relatively low (10 %), widespread extension orders ensure that collective bargaining coverage is very high.==== The latter fact also means that, if collective bargaining does add to statutory law, then its impact on working conditions and economic outcomes across the labour market could be substantial.====It is important to note that, for historical and political reasons, statutory labour legislation in Portugal is extensive and detailed. Throughout its more than 560 articles, the country’s Labour Code (‘Código do Trabalho’ or CdT, henceforth) establishes norms on several aspects of employment relationships. In this sense, Portugal is a particularly interesting case to study the interaction between base legislation and collective bargaining. Given the comprehensive nature of base employment law, can collective bargaining add much? Or is collective bargaining pushed to be even more comprehensive? More generally, is the relationship between collective bargaining and statutory law about complementarity or substitutability?====Our empirical analysis in this paper focuses on a set of six collective agreements, selected to exhibit a significant level of variability along several dimensions and therefore be potentially more representative of collective bargaining in the country. Specifically, these collective agreements encompass different sectors of activity (secondary and tertiary) and with different levels of exposure to international competition (a factor potentially relevant in the creation of rents that can be shared with employees). The agreements also exhibit varying numbers of companies and workers conducting the bargaining, and are subscribed by trade unions affiliated in the two main (national-level) confederations in the country.====Specifically, in our analysis, we consider the following sectors: metalwork (two agreements), footwear, construction, hospitality and tourism, and finance. We also focused on eight key labour law areas: hirings, fixed-term contracts, workplace organisation, work time, work suspension, remuneration provisions (excluding minimum wages schedules), discipline, and union rights. According to our reading of the agreements, these eight dimensions account for between half and two thirds of their contents. In our view, the number of agreements and the share of their contents that we analyse represent a good choice in the depth-width trade-off, in the context of our resource constraints.====From the analysis of the six conventions and eight areas mentioned above, we obtain more than 400 standards that we then examine and compare. In our main results, we conclude that a large percentage, over half of these standards – 59 % –, corresponds to the exact transcription or a very similar version of the equivalent standards in the CdT. We also found that only about 27 % of all the standards contained in the selected conventions offer more rights to workers, compared to the provisions already applicable from the CdT. The percentage of cases in which the standards of the CdT are revised in a less favourable direction from the perspective of the worker is even lower, at only 11 %. We conclude that, collective bargaining in Portugal adds relatively little value to statutory labour legislation. This is again with the exception of the minimum wage tables, which we leave for future research.====Promoting collective bargaining – and social dialogue – may benefit from a different approach by national legislative bodies, with a view to creating greater negotiating space for firm and worker representatives, given our evidence of substitutability between statutory law and collective bargaining. Our findings also illustrate the first application of the new methodology proposed here, which aims to evaluate the effective value added of collective bargaining. This template can be applied to other collective agreements, notably from other countries and time periods, so that a wider international understanding of this issue can be gained. For instance, it would be interesting to study countries where base law is less detailed than in Portugal. Such studies could examine the extent to which collective bargaining tends to add more value than in the case of countries like Portugal, where statutory labour law is more detailed.====The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we describe the legislative framework for collective bargaining resulting from the CdT. We then present the six collective contracts analysed (Section 3). In Section 4 we compare these six collective contracts with the CdT, based on our detailed reading of its various clauses over the eight dimensions mentioned above. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss the results obtained.",Assessing the legal value added of collective bargaining agreements,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819303011,19 March 2020,2020,Research Article,141.0

We then use these predictions to replicate and extend ==== analysis of how the party of the nominating president influences circuit judge's votes.","In the United States, judges wield significant power due to the common law system (Dainow, 1966). The extent of U.S. judges’ influence is a motivation for the extensive research into the determinants of judicial decision-making. In particular, there is a large literature on how opinions are affected by the ideology of the respective judge (Segal and Cover, 1989, Martin and Quinn, 2002, Martin et al., 2004, e.g.).====A leading paper in this literature is Landes and Posner (2009). This paper looks at how the party affiliation of U.S. Circuit Court judges affects the political ideology of their votes (conservative or liberal) on the court. While judges are nominally non-partisan, party affiliation can be proxied by the party of the appointing president or the party share in the Senate at the time of appointment. Landes and Posner show that judge party affiliation is statistically related to the ideological direction of votes.====For their empirical analysis, Landes and Posner (2009) draw upon the Songer database of U.S. Circuit Courts,==== which provides rich metadata, e.g., the political ideology of votes for each judge in each case. The classification of votes by ideological direction was a labor-intensive exercise which has led to frequent use in the empirical legal studies and political science literatures (Ginn et al., 2015, Reid and Randazzo, 2016, Landes and Posner, 2009, e.g.).====Notwithstanding its broad use in the literature, the Songer database has some limitations. First, the political ideology classification has been assigned by human coders, which could be error-prone. These errors add noise to regressions and complicate replicability. In particular, as noted by Landes and Posner (2009), the political positions of conservative/liberal are not constant over time. Therefore, data coded in the past may not be categorized correctly, and Songer Project ideology labels for older Circuit Court opinions may be systematically incorrect.====Another problem with the database is the sampling approach. First, the database is only available for 1925–2002, so empirical analysis of vote ideology is only possible for that time period. Second, only a small set of cases was labeled (just 5 percent of the cases for those years). Finally, the authors used stratified sampling to get labels for similar numbers of opinions across courts and time. Therefore, the dataset is not representative of the full distribution of circuit court cases.====The goal of this paper is to address these shortcomings using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The idea is to treat a machine to code the ideological direction of the votes. Within the set of labeled case, we can check how well the algorithm replicates human labels.====The classifier would provide a number of benefits. As soon as the classifier is trained, predictions even for an extremely large sample cost very little relative to hand-labeling (which require a human to read an opinion). We could potentially take the classifier to cases before 1925 and after 2002. Within the 1925–2002 period, we could classify the other 95 percent of unlabeled cases. Besides producing new labels, it could be used to audit and check existing labels for probable errors.====In this paper, we produce such a model. For the sake of interpretability, we focus on linear models. The model which worked best in our setting is a Ridge Classifier. Our model is trained on the complete opinion text in combination with the circuit, year as well as case type data. After optimization it achieves a cross-validated accuracy of 61.5% on the three label input and 66.5% on the two label subset. The final calibrated classifier working on the tow-label subset achieves the same accuracy score while increasing its precision as well its recall on the test set to 71.1% and 72.4% respectively.====With a validated data set in hand, we use it to undertake an extended replication of Landes and Posner (2009). First, we do our best to replicate the original paper and, despite some problems in replicating the original dataset, we could replicate significance as well as the direction of the most important coefficients. We extend the results and probe their robustness to multi-way clustering, group, and additional covariates. Finally, we show that the results hold partly when using our machine-predicted ideological labels as the outcome.====This paper contributes to the emerging literature applying data science techniques to empirical legal research questions. We review some of that literature in Section 2. After that, in Section 3 we describe the supervised learning task to predict ideological labels in circuit court decisions.

In this study we replicate and extend the analyses of data from three RCTs related to prisoner reentry, to more cleanly identify the causal effects of treatment. In two of the three experiments, our conclusions differ substantially from those of the original studies. We discuss best practices for running and analyzing RCTs, and consider our extension results in the context of the prisoner reentry literature.","Half of individuals who are released from prison are re-incarcerated within three years (DuRose et al., 2014). Practitioners and policy-makers across the country are working to reduce recidivism rates for those coming out of jail and prison in order to break this vicious incarceration cycle. Unfortunately, there is relatively little evidence to guide their efforts (Doleac, 2019a). In this paper, we replicate and extend the analyses from three evaluations of prisoner reentry programs, with the goal of learning as much as we can from existing evidence. These studies consider data from well-implemented randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where the original analyses made it difficult to conclude whether the programs of interest had causal effects on participants’ outcomes.====RCTs are typically considered the gold standard when it comes to program evaluation. They allow us to quantify the effect of treatment relative to a control group, and make it easier to avoid confounding factors that can complicate other research designs. Designing and implementing an RCT requires significant effort and resources, as well as buy-in from practitioners; this combination of challenges limits how frequently this type of research can be done, particularly in the criminal justice context (where safety and security concerns are paramount). Even in cases where RCTs are successfully implemented, many studies do not present or analyze the data in a way that cleanly measures the intent-to-treat (ITT) and/or treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effects. Our main goal in this paper is to extend existing studies by using up-to-date econometric methods to identify the causal effects of the programs being evaluated. Ensuring that estimates of treatment effects are unbiased allows us to add valuable information to a thin empirical literature.====This exercise also provides case studies on the extent of bias due to such problems as non-random attrition (which can introduce selection bias) and including endogenous control variables that are affected by the treatment. Economists tend to prioritize eliminating such biases, but reasonable researchers can disagree a priori about the likely magnitude of any bias. If – in the prisoner reentry context – selection and omitted variable biases are small in practice, and do not meaningfully change the estimated effects of the program being considered, then economists’ insistence on clean identification may lead us to unnecessarily dismiss valuable research evidence. On the other hand, if such biases are large, then many research studies in this area may be pointing us in the wrong direction.====We replicate and extend three studies: one on a swift, certain, fair (SCF) program of graduated sanctions for drug-involved probationers; one on aftercare programs for recently-released, drug-involved offenders; and one on a comprehensive reentry program for inmates in Minnesota. We find suggestive evidence that the SCF program reduced recidivism, but estimates are too imprecise to draw clear conclusions. Our reanalysis suggests that endogeneity bias in the original study affected the magnitude and sign of some coefficients, but not statistical significance (although this is because the study is substantially underpowered). In the aftercare program analyses, we find that (1) Therapeutic Communities reduced employment and earnings, with suggestive evidence that they also increased time incarcerated; and (2) Oxford Houses increased days incarcerated, with suggestive evidence of increases in employment. These conclusions differ substantially from those of the original study. Lastly, for the Minnesota reentry program, using matched comparison groups instead of simply controlling for baseline characteristics leads to conclusions that are qualitatively similar to those of the original study (that MCORP reduced recidivism). However, the data available did not allow us to conduct standard analyses based on original treatment assignment (to avoid selection and omitted variable biases). We thus interpret these results with caution.====These three studies were part of a larger set (identified in the course of review of the literature on prisoner reentry; Doleac, 2019a) where concerns about the analysis made it difficult to interpret the results. However, these three were the only studies where authors were willing and able to provide data for replication and extension.==== This set of studies may therefore be positively selected. This also points to a broader challenge in this research space: while it is now common for economics journals to require that authors provide replication files (including data) as a condition of publication, this is not yet the norm in other disciplines. This makes exercises like ours difficult if not impossible in most cases. Given a natural progression of quantitative methods over time, even methods that are cutting-edge at the time of publication may be viewed as falling short in the future. Being able to replicate and extend those analyses at a later date (as we do here) will facilitate a more rapid accumulation of knowledge.====For each study, we replicate the original analysis, then extend the results in two ways, one step at a time: First, we adjust the functional form of the empirical model used, as needed, to ease interpretation of the results and facilitate comparison with the broader literature. Second, we adjust covariates and other factors relevant to identifying causal effects. We generally expect that the functional form will not have a substantive effect on the results, and show this step for the sake of transparency. We do expect that addressing identification concerns will matter, reducing bias in the estimates.====This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 lays out recommendations for analyzing data from an RCT. Section 3 discusses the “Decide Your Time” SCF program; Section 4 discusses aftercare programs for recently-released, drug-involved offenders; and Section 5 discusses a holistic reentry program called MCORP. In each section, we discuss the original study, replicate the original results, then extend the analyses to more cleanly identify the effect of the program. Section 6 discusses our findings in the context of the broader literature on prisoner reentry programs, and Section 7 concludes.",Which prisoner reentry programs work?

If the recipient of the offer has a demand for fairness, then the equilibrium offer will contain some monetary surplus. However, if utility is a continuous function of the surplus contained in the offer, the standard results from the literature are unchanged.

In this model offers are coded as either fair or unfair, where all unfair offers impose a fixed utility penalty on the recipient if she accepts it. In such a model, the recipient of the offer will obtain a utility surplus (relative to her dispute level of utility) if the offer is perceived as fair. If this surplus is large enough, she will be willing to initiate a costly transfer of information.","In standard models of litigation costly disclosures never occur in the screening game, in which the uninformed party makes the offer, and costly discovery never takes place in the signaling game, in which the informed party makes the offer.==== These results appear to hinge on the assumption that the party making the offer can extract the entire monetary surplus of settlement from the party which receives the offer. This implies that the recipient of the offer who engages in a costly transfer of information earns her dispute payoff minus the cost of information transmission. We know from a large experimental literature on the ultimatum game the proposer generally cannot extract the entire monetary surplus with his offer.==== However, when we append a standard model of fairness to these litigation games, the result that the recipient of the offer never initiates costly information transmission does not change. In this model of fairness, utility is a continuous function of the surplus contained in the settlement offer. While some monetary surplus is contained in the equilibrium offer this is offset in a utility sense by the perceived unfairness of this offer. As in the standard model, this offer pins the recipient to her dispute level of utility. As a result, the informed party will still never make costly disclosures in the screening game or engage in costly discovery in the signaling game because she will be unable to recover the cost (in a utility sense) of doing so.====The results that the recipient of the offer never engages in costly information transmission seems artificial, yet the most straightforward relaxation of the model’s assumptions fails to undo this result. One interpretation is that the result is therefore correct as a practical matter. However, it is possible to modify the model of fairness in such a way that the result is overturned. This can be accomplished by making the perceived fairness of the offer a discontinuous function of the surplus contained in the offer. This may be considered a discrete model of fairness: offers are coded by the recipient as either fair or unfair. Accepting an unfair offer causes a negative term to be added to the recipient’s utility, while this term is absent when a fair offer is accepted. With the appropriate parameter restrictions this modified model can be made consistent with the costly transmission of information by the recipient of the offer.====Provided it is not too costly, information transmission will occur in the standard litigation model when the party making the offer initiates the information transfer.==== This includes the use of costly discovery in the screening game. The presence of fairness considerations makes these transmissions less likely to occur. The gain to the party initiating the information transfer is the surplus obtained when disputes are avoided. If part of this surplus must be given up to the recipient of the offer, the incentive to acquire the information is reduced.====In our formal analysis we use a screening game with an uninformed defendant and an informed plaintiff. In the standard version of this model, costly voluntary disclosures are never made. However, it should be clear to the reader that the insights we develop in this model would apply in an analogous fashion to a standard signaling model in which costly discovery is predicted never to be invoked.

We assume that giving is motivated by outcome–oriented or consequentialist norms, and conditional on (a) others’ behavior and (b) beliefs about how competent the government is. The evidence from a lab experiment in Peru is in line with this. On the other hand, we analyze the potential effects of two policies to increase giving, observing that less people give zero if they are informed about (i) two specific government projects (a subway line and a children’s hospital) or (ii) that some well-known Olympic medalist pays punctually her taxes, according to public information released by the Peruvian tax Agency. Our findings contribute to a burgeoning literature on tax morale and are arguably relevant to understand taxpayers’ non-selfish reasons to pay (or evade) their taxes.","Suppose that you participate in the following experiment, together with several other subjects: The experimenter endows each of you with $10, writes down a Public Treasury bank account number in a blackboard, and explains that you can anonymously donate whatever fraction of your endowment to the Government. After all subjects have decided, the experimenter will go to the nearest bank office and make an anonymous deposit for an amount equal to the aggregate donation. If you give $2, for example, the Government will hence increase its budget in that amount. What would you do?====We think that this decision problem allows us to understand better the potential ==== motives why people give money to their governments. Since paying taxes is a particular instance of that behavior, further, the experiment arguably offers insights on tax compliance, a question of capital importance – e.g., (Alm and Jackson, 1993; Andreoni et al., 1998; Torgler, 2005; Luttmer and Singhal, 2014; Mascagni, 2018, Alm, 2019). Of course, taxes are typically associated to a system of fines and sanctions for those who evade them,==== and to formal laws that somehow express the will of the society or some societal groups. The experiment cited abstracts from such features, focusing on those motives to give that do not require deterrence or the existence of a legal code; we extend on this argument later, in Section 2.====We study four main research questions, numbered ==== to ==== below. To start, ====: do people give more if they expect the government to spend the money efficiently and competently? ====: do people give more if they expect others to give as well? Our tentative answer to both ==== and ==== is “yes”, based on the utility theory developed in López-Pérez and Ramírez-Zamudio (2018). In this theory, people can internalize norms, and hence suffer a (heterogeneous) psychological cost C if they act contrary to what the norm prescribes, i.e., a negative, painful emotion like guilt or shame. People trade off this cost C with their material interest. Further, the norms are outcome-oriented or consequentialist, in that acts are prescribed conditional on their ==== consequences; more precisely, if they lead to an allocation maximizing social welfare. If people have heterogeneous expectations about the consequences of some act, therefore, they will face different normative prescriptions. In our experiment, for instance, some may think that their government is highly incompetent or corrupt. Hence, they should conclude that giving money is a waste, even in terms of social welfare. Others may be more optimistic and thus infer that donating some money is the right thing to do. Our affirmative answer to question ==== is thus explained. Further, the cost C of deviating is not fixed, but depends directly on (a) the magnitude of the deviation, i.e., the expected ‘harm’ or decrease in social welfare caused by the deviation. Point (a) reinforces the positive effect hypothesized for question ====: If an agent believes that the State is relatively efficient, she will feel rather badly for not doing the right thing (i.e., giving money, given her expectations), and hence will tend not to deviate much from the norm. In addition, C depends indirectly on (b) the average deviation among the reference group members (peer effects). Regarding question ==== above, therefore, we predict individual donations in our experiment to be conditional on others’ donations: If others are expected to give a lot, intuitively, an agent feels ‘inferior’ if she gives little, thus suffering a relatively larger ‘remorse’ C.====Our third question is ====: Do inequality concerns co-vary with giving? To clarify, think of a person who views social welfare as depending on equality (and not only, say, the social surplus). If this person believes as well that her government helps the poor or does a good job fighting inequality, she should donate ceteris paribus more money in our experiment. In effect, since she believes that giving is more socially ‘helpful’ than a person who is just concerned about the social surplus, her cost C for deviating is larger and hence should give more – recall assumption (a) above. We also explore two research questions related to ====. To start, left-wing supporters are perhaps more concerned about inequality; do they give more? Additionally, a person might dislike inequality because she believes that income mostly depends on chance (and not effort), thus finding large inequalities unfair. In this respect, do beliefs about the determinants of personal income influence donations?====We explore research questions ==== to ==== (and also ==== below) with the help of the experiment described above, which was run in Lima, Peru, having as recipient of the subjects’ donations the Peruvian Tax Office. In this manner, we contribute to a nascent literature on motivating tax compliance or contributions to public projects in developing countries, e.g., Mascagni (2018). It is also worth noting that participants in our study were a representative sample of the population of taxpayers in Lima, and not just university students. The data shows that (i) a substantial share of the subjects give something (around 64 % of them; N = 117), and a subject’s choice co-moves with (ii) her incentivized beliefs about the average donation by other subjects, and (iii) her level of support of the current government, arguably a proxy of her trust in that government. This is consistent with our presuppositions regarding questions ==== and ====. On the other hand, we do not find a correlation between donations and other variables like gender, political ideology, religiosity, age, and education. Left-wing supporters, in particular, are not more likely to give. In our experiment, in fact, fairness considerations do not seem to account for behavior ====. In contrast, non-donators are significantly more egalitarian and believe that chance is a relatively stronger determinant of income. This is an intriguing result for which we have yet no good explanation.==== In any case, our results indicate that the relationship between giving, fairness concerns, and ideology is not a simple one. Less unexpectedly, non-donators have as well relatively high (incentivized) expectations about the tax-to-GDP ratio, i.e., they arguably perceive a stronger tax burden.====Our final research question ==== concerns the potential effects of two policies that aim to increase giving to the government. In the Informed Policies (IP) treatment, the instructions mention two recent public projects in Lima: The subway line 2 and the new Children’s Hospital. In line with our theoretical framework, we conjecture that people are more willing to give if they are happy with the way in which the government uses the money. Yet people can be sometimes unaware or relatively uninformed about government spending (we provide indeed evidence in this line). By giving information about two specific public projects, therefore, we expect a significant increase in median giving relative to the Control treatment, as it happens to be the case (p < 0.032).==== In the Public Figure (PF) treatment, in turn, subjects receive instead information about a famous Peruvian Olympic medalist, noting that her firm pays its taxes punctually. In this respect, our framework predicts that giving is conditional, that is, people give more if they expect others to give as well. More to the point, further, we conjecture that this conditionality depends on the identity of the agent’s referents: Well-known and reputed public figures might be particularly influential. We hence predict that providing information about compliance by such type of figures should foster donations. In this line, the average donation equals 2.6 soles in Control (out of a 30 Soles endowment), but almost 5 soles in PF (p < 0.016). Fig. 1 below provides a more detailed picture of the treatment effects. The length of each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) in the corresponding treatment, whereas the vertical lines (“whiskers”) extend above (below) so as to include all data points within 1.5 IQR of the upper (lower) quartile, stopping at the largest such value – in turn, the dots represent data points beyond the whiskers. Clearly, subjects tend to be less generous in the control. Indeed, the median giver, represented by a line within each box, donates 0 Soles in Control, but 3 Soles in both IP and PF.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses how our research contributes to some related literature, while experimental design and procedures are described in Section 3.

All economic agents, individuals and corporate entities, have the right to bring their claims before a court and enforce their rights. However, the access to courts remains theoretical if courts do not deliver judgments within a reasonable period of time. In the case of a dispute, the involved parties aim at clarifying a legal situation at hand by obtaining a final decision. Any delay in legal proceedings keeps the involved parties in a protracted state of uncertainty that may be considered akin to a denial of justice. One thus might interpret delayed justice as denied justice.====Lengthy court proceedings have direct economic impacts. Slow judicial enforcement reduces the present value of monetary and non-monetary punishments in consequence of defaults on contractual agreements (Chemin, 2009a). In the case of credit markets, court delay might induce more borrowers to default as they might expect that creditors will not be able to recover their loans quickly through judiciary procedures (Japelli et al., 2005). As a consequence, creditors might reduce credit, leading to less investment and economic prosperity. Empirical evidence tends to support this line of argument. Djankov et al. (2003) construct an index of procedural formalism of dispute resolution for 109 countries, based on an evaluation of the exact procedures used by litigants and courts to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent and to collect a bounced check. The authors find this index to be positively correlated to average case disposition time, judicial unfairness and corruption. Chemin (2009b) shows for the example of a judicial reform in Pakistan that a decrease in the case disposition time (here by training measures) led to an increase of the entry rate of firms by 50 percent and additional growth in a range of 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product. Chemin (2009a) employs data on a judicial reform in India and shows that a speeding up of case disposition time improves credit market performance and increases aggregate output, especially in the farming sector, where credit markets play a decisive role. Visaria (2009) shows that the introduction of debt recovery tribunals in India led to a speeding up of the processing of debt recovery suits and caused reduced delinquencies and lower interest rates at constant borrower quality.====Against the background of the described negative consequences of court delay, research in the determinants of the length of trials is urgently necessary. While the literature has already identified a number of different factors influencing case disposition time, the legal doctrine of jurisprudence constante (‘ständige Rechtsprechung’) has yet received little attention. In contrast to precedents in the common law tradition, judicial decisions in civil law systems have no binding authority. Under jurisprudence constante, the emergence of repeated and uniform court verdicts in analogous cases over time creates a persuasive impact on future judicial decisions. Consequently, court decisions may generate a legal certainty “that codifications have failed to achieve” (Fon and Parisi, 2006, p. 522). Nevertheless, adjudication evolves on demand, not gradually, and while such judicial law-making may have consolidated some subfields of law, other kinds of disputes lack previous jurisdiction and hang in the balance.====In this paper we analyze the nexus between the availability of prior judicial decisions==== and case disposition time in the civil law. As a theoretical reference, we specify a two-stage rent seeking game between the litigants and the judge in the tradition of Tullock (1975). In our model, judges are motivated to decide correctly and parties may spend effort on improving their chances of winning the trial. Given this setting, we show that the availability of prior decisions on similar cases should particularly decrease rent-seeking effort of the litigants, and thus reduce case disposition time. We also show that the availability of prior decisions should increase the accuracy of the resulting verdicts. In the second step of our analysis we test our model empirically, based on data from a civil law country, a law system which is known to have more procedural formalism of dispute resolution than common law countries (Djankov et al., 2003). More precisely, we employ a unique dataset of case records from a German trial court and present empirical evidence in favor of the hypothesis that prior court decisions on similar cases shorten trials. We also study whether utilization of multiple prior decisions by the trial judge have an impact on process length. Our findings support the theoretical argument of Fon and Parisi (2006) that prior judicial decisions in civil law countries may play a subtler, but comparably beneficial role for legal efficiency as known from legal precedents in the common law.====The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a brief review of the literature on court delay. The theoretical framework is presented in section 3. Section 4 describes the available dataset and delivers some descriptive statistics. In section 5, we present and discuss the estimation results.

In this model we examine how such liability sharing rules affect the likelihood of tacit collusion. For this we use a standard Cournot oligopoly model where firms are collectively held liable for joint harm inflicted on third parties. With repeated market interaction and grim strategies, we investigate the sustainability of collusion to derive some policy implications.","Collusive behavior, be it tacit or explicit, is under constant scrutiny by competition authorities throughout the world. Substantial losses for consumers/buyers and total welfare as well pushed competition agencies to toughen up the sanctions against horizontal market coordination. In Europe, for instance, the fines imposed for cartel infringements by the European Commission alone amount to 28,464,092,824==== over the 1990–2018 period, from which 8,522,679,000==== were imposed during the 2014–2018 period alone.==== Detection of collusive behavior is crucial for the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement, and a thorough understanding of circumstances that may facilitate collusive agreements is indisputably needed. One feature that is so far missing from the economic analysis of collusion is the impact of apportioning rules for civil liability. This is the object of our paper.====We focus on situations where courts hold industry firms collectively liable for an injury caused to third parties. For instance, courts and even affected parties might be eventually unable to identify the actual producer of a defective good (Marino, 1991). This producer identification problem occurred for the famous DES litigation,==== as well as for airplane beverage carts,==== and even rowing exercise machines.==== Alternatively, the aggregate industry output may cause an indivisible injury, which is current in environmental liability cases, such as leakage of gasoline products==== or airplane noise pollution.==== Environmental liability cases are a prime example for the involvement of third-party victims in contrast to cases where consumers are harmed by defective products.====One important feature of all these examples is that they may relate to oligopoly markets, and hence the firms’ strategic market behavior might be affected by the courts’ choice in terms of apportioning collective liability among competitors. In this paper we examine to what extent the possibility of cooperative behavior on oligopoly markets, i.e. the likelihood of horizontal collusive agreements, hinges on the choice of liability sharing rules.====There are various ways to apportion liability among market firms. Starting with the DES Sindell v. Abbott litigation case, US courts often used market shares as a criterion to share damages among liable firms.==== According to this rule, the apportioning of liability is fully proportional to a firm's output level. This is in stark contrast to the per capita sharing rule, which is often enforced as a default solution,==== and according to which the share of the damage caused and ensuing liability incurred by a single firm are independent from output, but only depends on the number of (comparable) firms active on the market. Instead of focusing alternatively on one or another of these extreme cases (i.e. full or zero proportionality of individual liability w.r.t. output), we opt to model courts’ choice of apportioning liability among market firms by means of a composite sharing rule. This is a linear combination of the equal sharing (i.e. the per capita rule) and the market share rule, and allows us to examine to what extent the importance of the output proportionality in the apportioning of liability is likely to impact the cooperative market behavior.====To model market interaction, we use the workhorse model of symmetric Cournot oligopoly with linear demand. We assume that firms are held collectively and strictly liable for the harm generated by their aggregate output, and consider alternative cost structures for expected harm: first linear, then cumulative/quadratic in aggregate output. In order to meaningfully examine the emergence of cooperative behavior, we assume repeated market interaction and grim strategies. Note that although this framework is designed to study the sustainability of collusion that is reached in a “tacit”, i.e. non-cooperative way, to the extent that firms may not resort to explicit agreements to establish quotas or share markets and subsequently discipline deviations, the analysis is equally relevant for explicit agreements such as cartels. Indeed, sustainability is a necessary condition for cartels formed through explicit coordination as long as the punishment of a deviation cannot be legally binding. Hence for our analysis we use indistinctly the terms “(tacit) collusion” and “cartel”.====Based on this framework we derive several results. We find that when harm increases proportionally to aggregate output, the apportioning rule is neutral w.r.t. the likelihood of market collusion. In contrast, with cumulative harm (i.e. the damage increases more-than-proportionally w.r.t. aggregate output), we find that the sustainability of collusion does depend on the liability system used: the more weight the apportioning rule puts on market shares, the less likely the collusive behavior. By comparing the two scenarii, we also find that market collusion is relatively easier to sustain on markets where the harm jointly inflicted by industry firms is cumulative w.r.t. aggregate output.====The intuition for our results hinges on how a change in liability allocation impacts the relative gain from deviation from a cartel agreement to the ensuing relative loss in profits in the punishment phase. Both are affected by the double externality that firms exert among themselves: the one due to imperfect competition, and the one derived from the sharing of liability. A shift towards the market share rule makes deviation from the cartel agreement less attractive, since the increase in output by the deviating firm becomes relatively costlier in terms of liability. But then the punishment becomes less severe too, since the shift towards the market share rule also reduces competitors’ output in Cournot oligopoly, thereby increasing the equilibrium price and reducing the extent of the negative externality via the liability system. Cournot profits in the punishment phase become higher. Given the full linearity (both demand- and cost-wise) of the proportional harm scenario, the two effects are of equal weight, leaving the conditions for cartel stability unaffected.====With convex cost from harm, this neutrality result no longer holds. With a higher weight on market share liability, deviation from the cartel agreement by increasing own output still becomes less attractive and due to higher Cournot profits punishment is less severe. However, given that with convex harm the extent of the harm externality between firms is more important, firms gain more from the reduction in output achieved by a cartel than in the case of linear harm, especially if liability is not aligned to market shares. As a result, a move towards market share liability allocation reduces the loss in profits due to punishment relatively more than it reduces deviation profits, thus making collusion less likely.====Note that the non-neutrality result we obtain in the cumulative harm scenario is essentially a reminder that judicial decisions may actually impact the market outcomes/equilibrium, and possibly in a wrong way. By doing so, we add one more argument to the literature questioning the separability between antitrust and liability performance (see Daughety and Reinganum, 2014). However, policy conclusions in our setting that combines imperfect competition and harm externalities may be even more complicated as the two market imperfections may theoretically result in socially too high or low output levels with Cournot competition. A shift towards market share liability ==== reduces competitive output levels and this repercussions must also be taken into account for a welfare analysis. We conduct such a welfare analysis and find that the linear harm scenario argues for a move towards the per capital liability allocation, especially since the likelihood of collusion is not affected by such a shift. In contrast, for the scenario with cumulative harm a trade-off might exist between increasing output by a shift towards per capita liability and the higher likelihood of collusion in this case.====The paper proceeds as follows: first we briefly review the literature closely related to our topic (Section 2), before presenting the framework and notations we use (Section 3). We first solve the proportional harm case in Section 4, then go on to examine the cumulative harm one (Section 5). We discuss the welfare and policy implications of our results in Section 6, and check robustness of our results to the application of some alternative assumptions in Section 7. We consider price instead of quantity competition, partial instead of full market collusion, optimal punishments instead of grim trigger strategies, and also non-linear demand specifications.

Spruk and Kovac’s main contribution is to replicate Martin-Quinn scores’ Justice-level ideal points incident to a slightly different empirical strategy. Spruk and Kovac then extend their analysis by exploiting another prominent data set, Spaeth et al.’s (2018) Supreme Court Database, and identifying specific case issue codes that account for a large share of the ==== ideal points’ variation. For reasons that I outline below, while the Spruk and Kovac paper largely achieves its immediate replication objectives, the paper’s extension effort, by contrast, confronts inevitable limitations necessarily imposed by the Spaeth et al. database.","The need for greater attention to replication studies across quantitative social science fields has increased over time (Hubbard, 2019); indeed, of late attention to this topic has increased dramatically not only among academics but also in the popular media. Much of the current attention, sparked partly by, as Nosek et al. (2015) and Lilienfeld (2017) argue, a still-unfolding “crisis” in clinical psychology, continues to cast harsh light on various scholarly fields and sub-fields. While responses and reactions to this crisis continue to emerge, an annual replication conference for empirical legal studies, hosted by the Program for Empirical Legal Studies at Claremont McKenna College, is one noteworthy concrete response.====While a settled definition of what it means to “replicate” a study eludes, the Spruk and Kovac (2020) paper, ====, selected for presentation at the Second Annual Empirical Legal Studies Replication Conference, falls comfortably within the “sweet-spot” of numerous definitions. First, and as the paper’s title implies, Spruk and Kovac engage directly with one of the leading judicial ideology measures, the Martin-Quinn (2002) scores. On the replication front, Spruk and Kovac successfully replicate the Martin-Quinn’s Justice-level ideal points, but they did so incident to a slightly different empirical strategy. Specifically, Spruk and Kovac generated Justice-level ideal points with a direction-based reversal outcome variable and without imposing priors on case- and Justice-level parameters. Second, and on the extension front, Spruk and Kovac’s paper exploits another prominent data set, Spaeth et al.’s (2018) Supreme Court Database, and identifies specific case issue areas that account for a disproportionate share of the variation in the Justices’ ideal point scores.====While the Spruk and Kovac paper is both sophisticated and original, it is not without its own limitations. These flow from the paper’s focus on the Martin-Quinn (2002) scores and reliance on the Spaeth et al. (2018) database. Finally, a potentially even more important conceptual limitation is that Spruk and Kovac do not fully consider what may logically follow from their replication effort. That is, even if one concludes that the Spruk and Kovac paper succeeds in terms of its technical replication objective (as I largely do), replication efforts, including this one, should consider more fully what the results may imply for future scholars as well as for possible “next steps.” Specifically, even if the Spruk and Kovac paper has, in fact, successfully developed a slightly better “mouse-trap” when it comes Justice-level ideal points, it warrants independent consideration whether this constitutes enough of a contribution to the multi-decade judicial ideology literature that the paper seeks to improve. My broader claim in this Comment is that greater attention to “next steps” is warranted especially as the replication literature continues to develop and evolve.",Beyond replication: A few comments on Spruk and Kovac and Martin-Quinn scores,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818820300193,23 January 2020,2020,Research Article,148.0

It also predicts the diversity of corporate regulation and capital structure observed in practice.","This paper rationalizes an owner’s limited liability as a tool for a regulator to correct the externalities a firm imposes. It suggests limited liability prohibits a controlling owner from self-dealing with an external investor and improves the transparency of his business. Specifically, I argue an uninformed regulator can infer a firm’s private information by observing the transfer of a firm’s ownership, most likely through an acquisition of equity stake by the investor or bankruptcy process. My hypothesis is well-motivated, given that a financial contract often involves the transfer of ownership, which is a credible repayment method, as opposed to monetary returns. Indeed, whereas monetary returns first accrue to the owner who can divert them for his own benefit, physical assets are often fixed in place and can be seized by the investor before being diverted by the owner (Hart and Moore, 1998). Then, the owner may have to rely on the technology of transferring ownership to reach financial agreement with the external investor, even if the technology is exclusively possessed by the government. In turn, a regulator from the government has a chance of intervening in a firm’s business when a firm’s ownership is transferred from an owner to an investor.==== Then a regulator can induce efficiency through state-contingent policies.====In contrast to my view, some studies (e.g., Armour et al., 2009; Hansmann et al., 2006) argue the legal foundation of limited liability in contract (prohibiting a firm’s creditors from seizing an owner’s personal assets) is not as clear as that of entity shielding (prohibiting an owner’s personal creditors from seizing the firm’s assets), even if both are the core characteristics of the business corporation. Asset partitioning induced by these two characteristics enables firm and personal creditors to utilize their comparative advantage in evaluating and monitoring assets they are most concerned with. Such specialization allows creditors to reduce transaction costs and raises the value of assets that back up debt (Armour et al., 2009). However, why the business corporation mandates limited liability to firm creditors is still puzzling—in theory, it could be crafted by contract (Hansmann et al., 2006). To see how, let me consider the situation in which firm owners negotiate for the waiver of limited liability to firm creditors. Omitting this rule would improve the position of firm creditors and thus benefit all owners by decreasing the firm’s borrowing costs, whereas it would increase each owner’s personal borrowing costs. Then the benefit of omitting this rule would be spread among all the owners, but the burden of increased personal borrowing costs would be borne entirely by each owner. Each owner would therefore have a smaller incentive of omitting this rule.==== Thus, an owner is likely to be incentive-compatible with having limited liability to firm creditors even in the absence of law.====In addition, other studies argue a controlling owner’s limited liability in tort (shielding owners from liability to tort victims, such as third parties who have been injured as a consequence of the corporation’s negligent behaviour) can create incentives for excessive risk-taking by permitting owners to avoid the full costs of their activities (Hansmann and Kraakman, 1991). I consider limited liability in tort can be interpreted as a constraint as well as a rule. On the one hand, organizational law shields owners from personal liability to tort victims unless courts ``pierce the corporate veil.” In this sense, limited liability to tort victims is considered a rule.==== On the other hand, even in the absence of organizational law, an owner who lacks sufficient personal assets to cover a potential tort judgment can escape the full costs of his activity by entering personal bankruptcy (Hansmann and Kraakman, 1991). In this respect, it is a natural constraint that might limit the capacity of regulating his activity ex post. In either case, a regulator’s strategy to optimize sanction by substituting the costly detection of a corporate wrongdoing for the amount of the fine or the nonmonetary sanction might be infeasible because of this constraint.==== Thus, limited liability in tort might induce suboptimal business decisions because it precludes a regulator from effectively punishing the owner’s wrongdoing.====Both views make it puzzling why a standard form of enterprise organization often mandates, or at least admits, an owner’s limited liability to firm creditors or tort victims.==== I, however, argue it may be justifiable from the perspective of corporate governance and public economics. To see how, I start with considering the potential for externalities a firm does not internalize. Indeed, the failure of a firm, due to its excessive risk-taking, can trigger a domino-like collapse of other firms or markets, leading to widespread unemployment and economic downturns.==== At a more micro level, although the financial cost of business failure is mainly borne by the owner, family members are also likely to experience the adverse effects.==== Alternatively, a firm may not internalize environmental risks that impose negative externalities on consumers during catastrophic events.==== In the presence of such externalities, a regulator aims to impose penalties or taxes to correct market failure. The capacity to induce an efficient outcome, therefore, relies on the capacity to regulate a firm. One important factor that affects regulatory capacity is a firm’s incentive to allow the regulatory intervention in exchange for the use of technology exclusively held by the government (e.g., providing legal authority to transfer the property rights of assets). If a firm voluntarily reveals private information through this exchange, a regulator has a chance of correcting market failure through appropriate taxation. The other important factor that affects the capacity to regulate a firm is the presence of a stakeholder (e.g., an investor) who affects a controlling owner’s decision making. Even if an owner is not directly punishable, a regulator can influence the stakeholder who affects the owner’s business decisions if regulating the stakeholder is unconstrained. I thus consider incorporating the analysis of corporate incentive to allow regulatory intervention into the analysis of corporate decisions made in the presence of multiple firm agents is crucial to rationalize the presence of an owner’s limited liability as a rule.====Incorporating a regulatory perspective into corporate analysis, I argue an uninformed regulator induces efficiency without subsidizing a firm ==== the liability of a controlling owner to firm creditors is limited. When a firm imposes negative externalities in a particular state, a regulator needs to punish a firm only in that state. An uninformed regulator, who cannot observe the realization of that state, relies on a firm’s voluntary revelation. To incentivize truthful revelation, a regulator offers a controlling owner a legal option of transferring ownership to an investor. Indeed, a regulator that is concerned with a firm’s externalities often oversees the firm’s financial activity. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) closely monitors the capital structures of systemically important banks in the U.S. by introducing capital ratio requirements. It aims to make systemically important banks internalize negative externalities imposed on the real economy of their failure. Alternatively, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by a public utility firm. Simultaneously, it has the authority to assess civil penalties for the firm’s violation of regulation—it considers the loss of life and damage to the environment when assessing the seriousness of a violation. Of course, a controlling owner may not choose to transfer ownership, because he may find continuing business by paying the face value out of his own pocket is profitable. Indeed, the anecdotal evidence suggests entrepreneurs can engage in “propping”—they can clandestinely transfer private resources into firms that have minority investors (Friedman et al., 2003). For example, Barclays PLC and four former employees were recently charged with unlawful financial assistance during the Global Financial Crisis—the bank was suspected of lending to Qatari investors to prop up its shares to avoid government intervention.==== If the owner is able to inject private resources into the firm during recess, he is virtually able to issue a default-free security in which ownership transfer never occurs. However, if such action is prohibited, he is forced to transfer ownership per se whenever the firm’s net worth is negative. By limiting the liability of a controlling owner, a regulator can limit the strategy space of the owner and prevent regulatory arbitrage. Also, note a regulator can penalize an investor, instead of a controlling owner, to discipline corporate investment. For example, a regulator can directly impose a corporate tax or sanction when an owner shifts his ownership to an investor. Alternatively, a regulator can allow consumers to file lawsuits against corporations to recover damages when an owner shifts his ownership to an investor.==== Then a controlling owner internalizes the penalty imposed on an investor, who adjusts interest rates depending on the owner’s investment decisions. Thus, a controlling owner’s limited liability in tort==== does not constrain a regulator’s “effective” strategy space. Consistent with this conjecture, I find a regulator can induce efficient investment by penalizing an investor when a firm imposes negative externalities. Under this regime, a controlling owner is induced to transfer ownership only when a firm imposes negative externalities.====Note a regulator can substitute the penalty on a controlling owner with the tax on an investor due to the assumption that a controlling owner commits to his investment decisions to an investor. If he cannot commit, he does not internalize the effect of his investment decisions on financing cost. Then the marginal cost of taking investment risk is unaffected by the tax on an investor.====However, this assumption is not required for an uninformed regulator to induce efficiency without subsidizing a firm. When a controlling owner cannot commit to his investment decisions, a regulator can induce him to transfer ownership in the normal state by subsidizing him in that state. This subsidy makes him internalize the externalities a firm imposes in the other state. Meanwhile, a regulator can achieve a balanced budget by imposing a tax on an investor in the normal state. Importantly, a controlling owner does not internalize a change in financing cost associated with the tax imposed on an investor when he adjusts investment risk. He therefore retains an incentive to raise the probability of the normal state occurring. In this way, a regulator can induce efficient investment by simultaneously subsidizing a controlling owner and taxing an investor in the normal state. Under this regime, a controlling owner is induced to transfer ownership only in the normal state. Thus, this finding not only reaffirms the benefit of a controlling owner’s limited liability to firm creditors and the innocuousness of his limited liability to firm externalities, but also rationalizes the diversity of corporate regulation and financial contracts observed in practice.====Moreover, I find a regulator can optimally respond by tightening the limited liability constraint when a controlling owner and an investor can agree on a wider set of financial contracts. For example, when a controlling owner and an investor can agree on state-contingent payoffs, a controlling owner is able to avoid transferring ownership to finance his project. However, a regulator can still induce efficient investment by requiring the owner’s surplus in each state exceed a certain threshold. By setting the minimum surplus sufficiently high, the owner who never transfers ownership violates the requirement. A regulator therefore can adjust the extent of limited liability, depending on the set of feasible financial contracts between a controlling owner and an investor.",Limited liability and corporate efficiency,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014481881930170X,16 January 2020,2020,Research Article,149.0

Consistent with abstention theory, we show that ==== whose vote is pivotal have a lower probability of abstention than non-pivotal ones. In contrast, we fail to find evidence in support of the probability of abstention being positively related to appeals without stare decisis implications.","In voting procedures, abstention is generally seen in negative light. General election voters who decide not to participate are often deemed disengaged and lacking in their civic duties, as they fail to use the primary tool democracies provide to control governments. Further, concerns about the potential effect that voter turnout may have on an election outcome are common among commentators. Low level of participation in an election can very well undermine the legitimacy of the winner. While abstention tends to favor the majority, researchers have found that low turnout may result in skewed outcomes.==== While different institutional arrangements may lead to different levels of abstention, it is well established that abstention may also result out of an individual’s rational choices or strategic considerations. The seminal work of Downs (1957) recognized that voters’ self-interest may lead them to abstain, especially when the cost of voting is larger than the expected benefit. The theory predicts that voters will abstain more when the electorate is large -as their chances of being decisive are reduced-, when they don’t see any benefit of voting -as they are indifferent about the options or those alternatives seem too far away from their ideals-, or when they don’t have negligible voting costs (Palfrey and Rosenthal, 1983, 1985). Further, Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996) have shown that uninformed independent voters may find it rational to abstain in order to leave the decision to more informed ones.====Empirical evidence supporting the tenets of abstention theory have been found in different settings, such as in elections (Zipp, 1985; Plane and Gershtenson, 2004; Hortala-Vallve and Esteve-Volart, 2011; Wuttke, 2017) and in parliaments (Cohen and Noll, 1991; Rothenberg and Sanders, 1999; Noury, 2004). By contrast, although voting in courts has been studied extensively, abstention has not attracted the same scholarly attention. The existence of rules against abstention in many judicial systems is one of the likely culprits. For instance, it is somewhat common to find laws mandating that “[n]o [Supreme Administrative Court] member is allowed to refuse to vote on the question for decision, not even then if such member has been in the minority during the vote regarding a prejudicial question.”==== In addition, where no express prohibition exists, either voting is a very strong regularity==== or information about abstentions is often not available due to the secrecy of voting deliberations and voting procedures.====In one of the few articles exploring abstention in courts, Jacobi and Kontorovich (2014) define abstention as purposeful non-participation and posit that legal doctrines “… render standard rational choice explanations of abstention inapplicable to the judicial context”. Specifically, they claim that stare decisis, aided by the Marks doctrine -i.e. that the narrowest concurring opinion will be binding on subsequent courts in the absence of a single majority opinion-, raise the voting stakes due to the interdependence of cases. Using “impressionistic empirical evidence”, Jacobi and Kontorovich (2014) show that the while conditions for abstention -in terms of indifference or alienation- were often present in the United States Supreme Court since 1953, abstention never occurred.====In this paper, we empirically test the main tenets of abstention theory in the context of the Argentine Supreme Court (hereinafter CSJN) decisions. CSJN is an ideal setting to study abstention as it has a very large docket which strains Justices’ time and resources. As such, Justices regularly decide to abstain. Furthermore, appeal files in CSJN circulate sequentially among Justices and votes are added to an appeal file in this order too. This allows us to infer whether a voting Justice knows if a majority already exists at the time of deciding to cast a vote or not. We show that pivotal Justices are associated to a lower probability of abstention than non-pivotal ones, a result consistent with rational choice explanations of abstention. Surprisingly, we did not observe a significant difference in abstention likelihood between appeals with and without stare decisis implications, even after modifying the dependent variable to include both abstentions and certiorari denied dissents==== -which can be construed as functional equivalents of abstention-. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to empirically study the determinants of abstention in a High Court.====The paper proceeds as follows. In section II we present the legal and institutional background of CSJN. In section III we present the theoretical framework and construct our abstention hypotheses. In section IV we succinctly describe our data. Section V explains the underlying assumptions that account for the probability of abstention.

We examine the consequences of such rotation-induced spreading of judges' yearly court attendance across multiple courts, termed multi-court judging, for judicial productivity at disposing cases. Drawing on judge-level panel data from resource-starved Nepal, where multi-court judging alleviates courts' staffing and case disposition concerns, we find that multi-court judging exhibits a statistically and economically significant negative effect on judicial productivity at case resolution. The uncovered result cannot be explained by selection on unobservables, is robust to adoption of a dynamic panel instrumental variable approach, obtains under alternative model specifications, and survives a series of robustness checks. By identifying a hitherto unidentified cost associated with inter-court transfer of judges, our analysis provides a novel layer of considerations about judicial behavior and performance in career judiciaries.","The structure and functioning of judiciaries has been a major topic of interest in the literature in law and economics (see, e.g., Posner, 1999; Ramseyer and Rasmusen, 2003; Epstein et al., 2013). An important point of emphasis in this line of inquiry has been the distinction between “recognition” and “career” judiciaries, and the institutional features associated with each model of judicial organization (see, e.g., Georgakopoulos, 2000; Ramseyer and Rasmusen, 2006; Garoupa and Ginsburg, 2011; Ramseyer, 2019). In a recent influential contribution to this research, Garoupa and Ginsburg (2015) provide a comprehensive insight into the comparative organization of judiciaries across the globe, illuminating the importance of agency costs and judicial reputation.====In contrast to individual reputation-dominated, U.S.-style recognition judiciaries, where judges tend not to move jobs once selected for a judgeship, one of the core defining traits of career judiciaries is that judges are subject to periodic rotation across courts of equal seniority (Garoupa and Ginsburg, 2015: 8, 29–30, 100). Judges are normally transferred for two main reasons. First, rotation helps insulate judges from capture by local interest (Guerra and Tagliapietra, 2017), thereby fostering the judiciary's collective reputation vis-à-vis external audiences. Second, transfers facilitate career advancement, allowing the judicial administration to move chosen judges to courts in more desirable locations or, when transfer entails a vertical promotion, to a position at a higher court (e.g., Ramseyer and Rasmusen, 2003; Ramseyer, 2019).====Yet despite the ubiquity of judicial transfers in career judiciaries, the consequences of the transfer-induced spreading of a judge's annual court attendance over multiple courts―a practice we refer to as 'multi-court judging'―remain incompletely understood. Especially little is known about the repercussions of judicial transfers and multi-court judging for judicial behavior and performance in severely resource-starved legal systems, plagued by persistent court backlogs and delays, where furthering the courts' case disposition capacity often emerges as the paramount policy priority. Taking a step toward filling this gap in the literature, we investigate the consequences of multi-court judging for judicial performance in Nepal, one of South Asia's poorest countries.====In Nepal, the rotation of judges across courts is intended to not only safeguard judicial impartiality and allow for career advancement, as is normally the case in the comparatively more resource-abundant career judiciaries of Japan or Western Europe. Rather, the transferring of judges across courts also, or perhaps primarily, serves as a constitutionally-enabled mechanism for addressing the court system's perennial staffing shortages and workload imbalances. In Nepal, multi-court judging that results from transfers of judges from the comparatively less to the comparatively more understaffed courts is thereby viewed as a means to facilitate the disposition of justice. There currently exist no systematic, comprehensive data on the use of judicial transfers and multi-court judging for purposes of addressing case disposition concerns in other jurisdictions. However, the Nepali-style rotation of judges as an approach to increasing court output has also been affirmed in other understaffed judiciaries, such as those in the post-socialist world (Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2012a: 21; Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2016: 21).====In investigating the consequences of multi-court judging for judicial performance in Nepal, we thus naturally focus on judicial productivity at case resolution, defined as the total number of cases that a judge disposes over a given period of time. A judge's ability to resolve cases captures a salient facet of judicial performance: all else equal, a judge who in a given amount of time resolves more cases is better than a judge who in the same amount of time resolves fewer cases. This approach, however, also comes with several caveats. First, judicial productivity does not measure judicial efficiency, a broader metric that offers insight into how judicial inputs are combined in the production of judicial output (see, e.g., Schneider, 2005; Falavigna et al., 2015). Second, judicial productivity at case resolution captures a very specific aspect of judicial performance. In particular, much like speed of case resolution or case duration (see, e.g., Ramseyer, 2012; Coviello et al., 2015; Christensen and Szmer, 2012), it is a purely quantitative measure that does not reflect adjudicatory quality (see, e.g., Posner, 1999: 226). Third, the volume of resolved cases is only one possible measure of judicial output; other candidate measures, such as the commonly used number of published or cited opinions (see below), are not available to us for institutional reasons (Nepali lower court judges do not publish opinions). Fourth, the number of disposed cases does not distinguish between different modes of case disposition, such as trial-based judgments, default judgments, settlements, abandonments, and dismissals on procedural grounds, which in general require different levels of judicial involvement and time (see, e.g., Refo, 2004; Langbein, 2012). Fifth, the number of cases that a judge disposes in a given amount of time depends not only on the judge's effort but also on a host of other factors beyond the judge's immediate control (see, e.g., Bielen and Marneffe, 2017). In particular, our measure of judicial productivity does not depict the nuances of judicial case management which we do not observe in our data (see, e.g., Choi et al., 2013).====Nevertheless, the rate at which judges dispose cases casts light on a vital aspect of judicial behavior. This aspect has naturally been de-emphasized in the context of comparatively well-functioning judicial systems such as the U.S. federal judiciary (Posner, 1999: 188–189, 226; Epstein et al., 2013), where court backlogs and case disposition rates have in general not been a notable concern.==== However, insufficient court output and corresponding slow case disposition have been a major issue in many resource-starved judicial systems outside the U.S. (see, e.g., Dakolias, 1999; Djankov et al., 2003) and especially in South Asia (Chemin, 2009a, 2009b, 2012). In Nepal, for example, timely disposition of cases has been articulated and repeatedly reaffirmed as a key policy priority and judges' success at disposing cases as central to judicial work performance (see Section 2). Accordingly, the above-mentioned caveats notwithstanding, in an effort to provide a quantitative, evidence-based portrayal of the functioning of judiciaries internationally, a series of empirical contributions has explicitly measured judicial performance with the volume of court case dispositions (see, e.g., Beenstock, 2001; El Bialy, 2016; Rosales-Lopez, 2008; Chemin, 2009b; Beenstock and Haitovsky, 2004; Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2016; Grajzl and Silwal, 2017; Dakolias, 1999: 99). We draw on and extend this line of research to examine the impact of multi-court judging on judicial productivity at case resolution in Nepal.====In the ensuing section we first provide the necessary institutional background on Nepal. We then argue conceptually that multi-court judging may exert a negative effect on judicial productivity at case disposition for two primary reasons. First, unlike many business projects, court cases are not portable. A transferred judge hence cannot continue resolving the cases that he/she already partially processed at the initial court. Instead, he/she must invest scarce time and effort (see, e.g., Epstein et al., 2013: Ch. 1) in learning the facts of both the unprocessed newly filed or backlogged cases as well as, importantly, of any already partially-processed cases that he/she is allocated upon transferring. Second, unlike judges who get to adjudicate cases at a single court, multi-court judges are subject to acclimation effects that arise when, following a transfer, a judge must familiarize himself/herself with the routines, people, and work culture at the new living and work environment. Adjusting to the resulting changes requires time and impacts a judge's on-the-job and off-the-job satisfaction (ibid.), which can in turn affect his/her productivity.====To examine the effect of multi-court judging on the productivity of Nepali judges, we utilize an originally assembled judge-level panel dataset, which we introduce in Section 3. In our data, we do not observe transfers per se, but rather the distribution of each judge's annual court attendance across one or more courts in any given year. We measure the extent of Nepali judges' multi-court judging in two different ways. Our first approach is based on indicator variables counting the number of distinct courts that a judge adjudicated in during the course of a given year. Our second approach is based on a Herfindahl-Hirschman-style index capturing the extent of concentration of judge's yearly court attendance across the courts. We document that multi-court judging is pervasive in Nepal, a fact indicative of the comparatively frequent use of judicial transfers for above-mentioned purposes of addressing courts' staffing and case disposition concerns.====In carrying out the estimation in Sections 4 and 5, we rely on multiple empirical approaches. All of our estimated models include judge-fixed effects to control for any judge-specific, time-invariant unobserved characteristics that may exert an effect on judicial productivity and, at the same time, influence whether a judge adjudicates in multiple courts in a given year. Ordinary-least-squares (OLS) estimates reveal a statistically and economically significant negative association between multi-court judging and judicial productivity. Holding constant a judge's annual court attendance and all else equal, a judge assigned to two courts resolves eight percent fewer cases, and a judge assigned to three or more courts 18 percent fewer cases, than a judge who adjudicates cases at a single court. The application of Oster’s (2019) recent methodological contribution further demonstrates that our OLS results cannot be explained by omitted variable bias.====To further tackle endogeneity concerns stemming from the possibility that Nepali judges are selected for multi-court judging based on their performance or some unobservable time-varying attribute, we also employ an instrumental variable method applied to a dynamic panel specification. We find that our OLS results are fully robust to this approach. Relative to the OLS estimates, taking into account the persistence of judicial productivity in fact increases the magnitude of the negative effect of multi-court judging on judicial productivity. The estimated negative effect of multi-court judging is further robust to a wide range of additional tests and alternative model specifications. Finally, we demonstrate that our measures of multi-court judging are correlated with two additional judge-level outcomes that normally reflect judicial effort, but are uncorrelated with a third outcome that in general should not depend on judge's effort or performance. That is, our data pass a falsification test.====Our paper contributes to, and connects, two strands of the broad literature on judicial behavior. The first is the scant literature on judicial transfers in career judiciaries. Within this literature, Ramseyer and Rasmusen (1997, 2003, 2006, 2007) and Ramseyer (2009, 2012) investigate the functioning of the judicial transfer system in the carefully managed Japanese judiciary. The resulting research, among others, illustrates the importance of political considerations, talent, and performance for career start and advancement of judges in Japan. Guerra and Tagliapietra (2017) explore the related phenomenon of judicial turnover in the Italian judiciary, demonstrating that court turnover is positively associated with court congestion. Their analysis, however, utilizes court level data and is unable to explicitly address the direction of causality. We advance this literature by drawing on a judge-level dataset from an understudied judicial system. Importantly, the panel structure of the data allows us to control for factors that have proved important for explaining judicial transfers elsewhere, thus enabling us to assess the consequence of transfers-induced multi-court judging for judicial productivity in the Nepali context.====The second strand of the literature that our papers adds to is the growing literature on judicial productivity, broadly construed. Despite the by now widespread recognition that in-depth insight into and effective reform of judiciaries require “empirical foundations” (Epstein et al., 2013), the question of how to best measure judicial productivity and performance remains an unsettled one (see, e.g., Posner, 1999: 9–12, Smyth and Bhattacharya, 2013: Sec. 5; Choi et al., 2009; Baker et al., 2009; Cross and Lindquist, 2009; Gensler and Rosenthal, 2014; Young and Singer, 2013). Accordingly, scholars have proposed a series of approaches, ranging from the use of purely quantity-oriented measures, such as the speed or volume of case resolution (e.g., Ramseyer, 2012; Coviello et al., 2015, 2018; Bray et al., 2016; Christensen and Szmer, 2012; Szmer et al., 2012; Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2012b), the number of signed or published opinions (e.g., Teitelbaum, 2006; Choi et al., 2009, 2010, 2011a, 2011b), and counts of decisions that distinguish between law application versus case management (Choi et al., 2013); to approaches that strive to adjust for the quality aspect of judicial output, as reflected in citations (e.g., Posner, 1999: 234–236, Bhattcharya and Smyth, 2001; Choi et al., 2010, 2011a, 2011b; Smyth and Bhattacharya, 2013), appeals or reversal (e.g., Coviello et al., 2015, 2018; Choi et al., 2011a; Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2012b), and even measures of procedural fairness (Young and Singer, 2013).====Depending on the featured productivity measure, this literature reveals that judicial productivity varies systematically with a number of legal and extra-legal factors, including but not limited to procedural aspects of case scheduling and management (Coviello et al., 2015, Bray et al., 2016; Chemin, 2009b), specialization in case resolution (Coviello et al., 2018), circuit-level political diversity (Choi et al., 2011a), whether a judge is appointed or elected (Choi et al., 2010), judge's educational background (Ramseyer, 2012), and promotion concerns (Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2012a). Studies exploiting court-level data further indicate that judges adjust their productivity effort based on caseload pressure and in response to court-level staffing changes (Beenstock and Haitovsky, 2004; Dimitrova-Grajzl et al., 2012b, 2016). We contribute to this literature by providing the first analysis of the implications of multi-court judging as a hitherto unexplored determinant of judicial productivity at case disposition, a particular, yet in the given (Nepali) context salient, aspect of judicial performance. Indeed, as we emphasize in the concluding Section 7, our analysis identifies a previously never highlighted cost associated with inter-court transfer of judges and thereby provides a novel layer of considerations pertinent to debates about the structure and performance of career judiciaries.",Multi-court judging and judicial productivity in a career judiciary: Evidence from Nepal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819302042,7 January 2020,2020,Research Article,151.0

Our analysis is based on a unique dataset comprising 1445 offenders, all eligible to semi-liberty. In the absence of an instrumental variable affecting access to semi-liberty but unrelated to recidivism, we turn to selection-on-observable methods as well as sensitivity analyses to bound the causal effect of interest. Our results under treatment exogeneity (Cox regressions) and conditional independence (entropy balancing matching) show that semi-liberty is associated with a reduction of 22%–31% in offenders’ hazard of recidivism in the five years after release. The estimated effects decrease, but remain negative and significant when credible confounders are introduced. Overall, our analysis lends strong support for a beneficial effect of semi-liberty compared to prison.","Recidivism is a pervasive issue in many criminal justice systems worldwide. In the United States, 55 % of state prisoners released in the year 2005 were reconvicted and 77 % were rearrested in the next five years (Durose et al., 2014). In France, the reconviction rate is estimated at 59 % within five years after prison release (Kensey and Benaouda, 2011). In light of these high recidivism rates, scholars often refer to prison as a revolving door, with a small fraction of the general population accounting for most transitions in and out of prison (Freeman, 2013).====Many developed countries are increasingly turning away from prison-centered policies and adopting new strategies to prevent crime and recidivism. One of them consists of promoting alternative sanctions such as electronic monitoring, probation or semi-liberty, which are cheaper than prison and often perceived as more effective in preventing recidivism. Semi-liberty (SL hereafter) is an interesting mix of custody and liberty. Offenders under SL are free during weekdays, but have to stay at night and during weekends in dedicated correctional facilities, often called “halfway houses” or “semi-liberty centers” in France. While in the United States halfway houses are typically used to smooth the transition from prison to the community, semi-liberty can also serve as a front-door alternative to prison in France.====Semi-liberty has the potential to deliver three crime-control ingredients: i) incapacitation due to daily correctional supervision; ii) deterrence, as SL makes the threat of traditional incarceration very salient; and iii) rehabilitation, since offenders are expected to work outside or receive job training and may benefit from medical treatment or family support. While theoretically attractive, semi-liberty is (curiously) rarely mentioned in discussions on criminal justice reform, and its extent appears to decrease in several countries without clear explanation. In the United States for instance, although halfway houses receive tens of thousands of federal prison releasees annually, the trend is diminishing and residential reentry centers are being shut down (Politico, 2018).====As shown in Fig. 1, the annual flow of offenders benefiting from SL in France decreased from 6000 to 7000 per year between 1990 and 2006 to about 4500 more recently. Although French prisons suffer from severe overcrowding (with around 70,000 prisoners for a 59,000 capacity in January 2019), most semi-liberty centers work under capacity with a 62 % occupancy rate (DAP, 2018). Thus, part of the pressure inside prisons due to overcrowding could be lessened by using the currently available slots in semi-liberty centers. Surprisingly, the limited appeal of semi-liberty is in stark contrast with the massive use of electronic monitoring in France (10,200 offenders on January 1 2018, for an annual inflow of more than 20,000), although the two types of sanction target very similar types of offenders and share common features. One might think that so few convicts are in semi-liberty precisely because this measure has proven to fail. However, there is very limited evidence available to judges and policymakers on its empirical impact of recidivism.====Regarding the effects of front-door semi-liberty on future crime, there is no compelling evidence either in France or abroad, as opposed to electronic monitoring (Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2013; Henneguelle et al., 2016) or other probation programs (Mueller-Smith and Schnepel, 2017).==== This gap can certainly be explained by the lack of access to micro-level data, by the heterogeneity of semi-liberty programs across contexts, and by the difficulty to properly account for selection bias. Indeed, judges presumably select the best, most fit, lowest-risk offenders to enter such programs (while other offenders are incarcerated), making simple group comparisons of recidivism rates unreliable.==== So far, the few existing studies on semi-liberty and recidivism have attempted to account for selection bias by controlling for observable differences.====They typically use logistic regressions (Clark, 2016), propensity score matching (Hamilton and Campbell, 2014), or a combination of the two methods (Constanza et al., 2015). However, selection on unobservables may well remain and lead to (potentially important) bias in the estimated effects. To date, the only quasi-experimental evaluation of the effect of SL on recidivism focuses on a back-door transitional program in Iowa. Using random variation in counselors’ use of halfway housing versus traditional parole near the end of prisoners’ sentences, Lee (2019) estimates that halfway houses significantly increase the three-years probability of return to prison for prisoners on the margin, compared to parole. This detrimental impact is partly explained by the greater supervision and detection of wrongful behavior (new crimes or technical violations) imposed in halfway houses, but it may also be related to negative interactions between inmates. While Lee (2019) offers the first clean evidence on halfway houses and recidivism, this study does not inform regarding the impact of semi-liberty used as a full substitute for incarceration.====This paper seeks to fill this gap by providing estimates of the causal effect on recidivism of semi-liberty, as a front-door alternative to incarceration. Interestingly, in France, SL is only accessible to offenders convicted of prison sentences: SL-offenders and incarcerated offenders therefore come from the same pool of prison convicts. However, selection bias is also likely to arise in this context. The decision to grant SL to prison convicts (or to incarcerate them) is possibly based on information that is observed or inferred by judges (in relation to police files or court hearings for instance), but not measured in the datasets available to researchers. Examples of such potential confounders include impulsivity and other personality traits, quality of family support, economic burden, social deprivation, drug or alcohol addictions or gang membership. Due to data restrictions, it is not possible to measure the effect of those variables on the probability of obtaining SL as well as on recidivism.====At the same time, judges themselves have certainly incomplete knowledge of those types of variables, for at least two reasons. First, probation officers who are supposed to write a social survey about all eligible convicts have only very limited time and have to deal with many people at once. Second, they rely only on self-reported data and generally do not verify convicts’ statements. From an empirical perspective, a difficulty is that judges are also interested in the “rehabilitation project” of convicts (Henneguelle, 2020). This project, which does not take the form of a file but is presented orally, is not available to researchers. Its content is related to the social and economic integration project and is likely to have some influence during the hearings, as judges are keen to test the motivation of the defendant. Such confounders are expected to bias the impact of SL on recidivism (omitted variable bias).====Therefore, contrary to most previous studies on the effects of semi-liberty on recidivism, our empirical strategy explicitly acknowledges the potential for selection bias and carefully accounts for it. Ideally, we would like to exploit a quasi-experimental setting with similar offenders facing (randomly) different chances of serving their sentence under semi-liberty. However, we fail to identify such a situation in the French context. Alternatively, we rely on a sensitivity analysis to offer credible bounds of the causal effect of SL on recidivism in the presence of confounding factors. Statistical methods to bound causal effects in the presence of selection bias are rapidly developing for linear models (Millimet and Tchernis, 2013; Krauth, 2015; Oster, 2019). In addition to those methods, we attempt to fully exploit the time dimension of recidivism dynamics that can be precisely tracked in our data and apply sensitivity analysis in the context of survival models (Austin, 2014; Lin et al., 2013).====Our analysis is based on original survey data collected from the French Prison Administration. The dataset includes the full criminal records of a representative sample of about 8000 inmates released in the year 2002, from their first conviction to the year 2008. We limit our attention to the 1445 sampled offenders who either benefited from or were eligible for front-door SL, and track recidivism during a follow-up period of more than five years. Our empirical analysis seeks to disentangle the influence of selection on observable and unobservable characteristics when measuring the causal effect of SL. For that purpose, we follow the three following steps in our empirical framework. First, we report estimates from non-parametric Cox regressions under the assumption of treatment exogeneity. Second, we consider a selection-on-observables framework and implement entropy balancing matching to calculate the average treatment effect of SL. Third, we evaluate the robustness of our estimates by simulating the impact of confounding factors.====Our main results can be summarized as follows. First, we observe an unadjusted difference of 39 % in terms of hazard of recidivism between SL offenders and incarcerated offenders. Second, this gap in hazard reduces in magnitude after controlling for offenders’ key individual characteristics in Cox regressions (treatment exogeneity) and after balancing entropy matching (conditional independence), but remains sizeable and statistically significant with estimated reductions in hazard ranging from 22% to 31%. Third, we find that the estimated treatment effect of SL remains negative and significant under credible confounding and only turns insignificant in extreme cases of confounding.====The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the French institutional context and describes our data. The third section presents the various econometric results obtained by Cox regressions and matching algorithms along with sensitivity analyses to measure the robustness of our findings to the presence of unobservable confounders of different intensity. Finally, the fourth section concludes and discusses some public policy implications.","Prison, semi-liberty and recidivism: Bounding causal effects in a survival model",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819302418,27 December 2019,2019,Research Article,152.0

These results, however, depend upon an insufficiently granular model of strategic incentives under the Hand Formula that ignores courts’ information constraints. Taking information constraints into account, we identify a set of cases where care by one agent significantly increases the benefits of care by the other. When such cases obtain under bilateral harm, comparative negligence generates greater incentives for care, but this additional care occurs only when it is not socially optimal (i.e., “defensive care”). By contrast, under unilateral harm or asymmetric costs of care, contributory negligence creates socially excessive care. Therefore, it is possible to socially rank negligence regimes depending upon the symmetry of potential harm and costs of care. We discuss optimal choice of rules in light of these results.","For accidental injuries, tort law requires negligence on the part of the defendant for the plaintiff to recover damages. Relatively early in the common law, courts developed the doctrine of contributory negligence, which held that a plaintiff who was guilty of negligence could not recover damages against a defendant who was negligent. This put the emphasis on negligence as the general standard for sharing the risks mediated by care, with associated rules designed to induce potential tortfeasors to internalize the costs of their actions and engage in socially efficient behavior.====The harshness of the contributory negligence rule led many legislatures (the majority at present) and some courts (for example, Georgia) to soften its impact by introducing a comparative negligence rule. Under comparative negligence, a negligent plaintiff is permitted to recover some percentage of his damages against a negligent defendant, depending on the court's assessment of the degree to which each party's negligence contributed to the cause of the accident (e.g., Moffitt v. Carroll, 640 A.2d 169 (Del. 1994)).====One of the most important questions in the economic analysis of law is the extent to which comparative negligence affects deterrence – specifically, the incentive to take care – in comparison to the older rule of contributory negligence. In an important paper that was the first to analyze the incentive question, Brown (1973) found that the contributory negligence rule generated optimal deterrence incentives. However, he concluded that comparative negligence led to suboptimal incentives. This conclusion stood until Haddock and Curran (1985), Cooter and Ulen (1986), and Rea (1987), using more accurate specifications of the comparative negligence rule, showed that incentives for care are optimal under comparative negligence, just as under contributory negligence, when considering cases of bilateral harm (i.e., both parties can be victims).==== Indeed, Haddock and Curran show that comparative negligence may be superior if courts do not have perfect information and therefore make mistakes in assessing negligence,==== though Bar-Gill and Ben-Shahar (2003) find less support for this argument. A literature begun by Orr (1991) and Chung (1993) further found that this equivalence held in cases of unilateral harm as well. These equivalence results have been incorporated into the major texts on the incentives of torts (e.g., Landes and Posner, 1987, Shavell, 1987).====The equivalence results in the earlier papers have all assumed that when courts apply the Hand Formula to determine the negligence of a party, they follow a two-step process: first, they determine the globally optimal level of care for both parties, and then they determine whether the parties accused of negligence met that level of care. In short, the negligence test is derived from conditions specifying optimal care levels for each party.====This standard framework has an imperfect fit with the law. Tort law has prominent cases that clearly reject the two-step algorithm – such as ====,==== which immunizes land owners from contributory negligence for failing to avoid harm to their property caused by negligent invasions.====More generally, the negligence test does not instruct judges to determine the globally optimal level of care. Instead, it frames a straightforward question: ====. This “localized” algorithm, not the two-step algorithm of the literature, is what courts apply.====This paper examines the incentive effects of contributory and comparative negligence under the algorithm courts actually use to determine negligence. We find that contributory and comparative negligence do not necessarily generate equivalent care levels. Richer strategic incentives emerge (encompassing the equivalence results as special cases), which allow for the possibility that the court may find a party negligent, because taking care is optimal given that the other party takes care, even if a lack of care by ==== parties would be the social optimum.==== Such “defensive care” equilibria have not been suggested in the previous models. However, the empirical literature suggests that they are economically significant (e.g., Kessler and McClellan, 1996). The informationally-constrained (or localized) procedure we examine provides an explanation for defensive care, which would otherwise remain a puzzle under the standard framework. For example, in the medical care context practices that would be described as “defensive medicine” emerge as equilibria under contributory negligence in this paper's model, whereas they could not in the standard framework unless the analyst assumes that the due care standard is set erroneously high.====Evaluating an informationally constrained application of the Hand Formula is appropriate for several reasons. First, as noted earlier, the localized algorithm appears to be what the law requires judges to apply. A model of rational courts should assume judges follow the law and otherwise extend no additional effort. Second, even if a judge were to attempt to determine whether the locally optimal care outcome is also globally optimal, he or she would encounter additional obstacles in the law. Precedents are “sticky”: as decisions on a recurrent negligence charge accumulate, courts establish precedent to which they try to adhere in future cases and tend to forgo efforts to calculate optimal care ex ante in alternative scenarios. In professional malpractice cases, courts generally consult professional norms to determine negligence rather than attempt to determine globally optimal care. Finally, even if a judge were to ignore formal legal tests, and to incur the costs of distinguishing precedential or customary rules, he or she may simply lack the information necessary to determine the global optimum in care.====When we frame the application of the Hand Formula as whether the cost of the care under consideration is less than the reduction in expected harm ==== (e.g., McCarty v. Pheasant Run, Inc., 826 F.2d 1554, 1557 (7th Cir 1987); Davis v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 788 F. 2d 1260, 1265 (7th Cir. 1986); Hession v. Liberty Asphalt Products, Inc., 235 N.E.2d 17, 22 (Ill.1968); LeRoy Fibre Co. v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry., 232 U.S. 340, 352 (1914)), we find substantive differences between the two negligence rules driven by the strategic implications of dual care. Whether contributory or comparative negligence is socially preferable depends, in this model, on the allocation of injury risk that would occur naturally, without the intervention of the law. Only one party naturally bears all the risk in the case of unilateral harm, whereas both share the risk naturally in the case of bilateral harm.====With unilateral harm, we find that contributory negligence creates weakly greater incentives for care – that is, incentives for care are at least as great under contributory than under comparative negligence and under some conditions greater. In particular, when there is strong strategic complementarity in care (care by one party is unproductive unless the other takes care), contributory negligence achieves strictly greater care by creating an incentive for the potential victim to take care even when he expects the injurer will not in order to “foist” the residual liability onto the other party. Expecting this behavior, the injurer will also take care, even when it is not socially optimal for either party to do so – i.e., we observe defensive care. In the absence of strong strategic complementarity in care, incentives for care are the same under contributory and comparative regimes. Therefore, with unilateral harm, comparative negligence is weakly socially dominant despite having weaker incentives for care, as it forces both parties to share damages when both fail to take care, reducing incentives for foisting.====To illustrate, consider accidents involving railroads and pedestrians, where the harm is always unilateral. This model implies that comparative negligence is preferable to contributory negligence, not because of the traditional argument that it enables plaintiffs to recover some portion of their loss, but because in view of the actual implementation of the negligence test the comparative rule provides superior incentives for care in the unilateral harm setting.====With bilateral harm, by contrast, it is possible for comparative negligence to result in one party “over-internalizing” the potential harms, and hence taking care even when it is not socially optimal (provided that the same party expects to bear a majority of the joint loss). Therefore, contributory negligence is weakly socially dominant despite having weaker incentives for care.====In addition to our focus on implementation of the law, the key innovations in our results are driven by the strategic implications of dual care. Most previous comparisons of contributory and comparative negligence missed the possibility of ==== which allows one party to de facto “create” negligence on the part of a party not taking care. Our emphasis on the strategic behavior of agents formalizes some of the arguments of Grady (1990), who first identified the phenomenon of “strategic foisting” of liability. Therefore, choice of negligence regime (or of risk sharing within comparative negligence regimes) can dampen excessive care incentives that such foisting creates. Indeed, when costs of care differ greatly, strategic foisting undermines the cheapest-cost-avoider rationale familiar in the literature since Calabresi (1970).====Our results lead to simple recommendations for courts and legislatures when determining which negligence rule is optimal. When harm is bilateral and costs of care are symmetric (e.g., automobile accidents), contributory negligence leads to socially preferable incentives; by contrast, with either unilateral harm or asymmetric costs of care (e.g., medical malpractice), comparative negligence leads to optimal incentives by generating symmetry between the agents. When considering the specific question of ==== generally to divide damages conditional on both sides being found negligent, we show that damages should be split based upon cost of care – i.e., those facing higher costs should pay a greater share. Since some legal tests in contract law and even in criminal law depend on a reasonableness inquiry analogous to the Hand Formula, our model has applications beyond the accident law setting.====We note that this is not a model of error in application of the legal standard.==== The due care standard is not set erroneously high or low here. Courts apply the negligence test accurately in this model. However, the algorithm framed by the law for implementing the test, accurately applied, generates inefficient care equilibria.====In Section 2, discusses the model and the results under unilateral harm. Section 3 discusses the general results under bilateral harm. Section 4 discusses when the costs of care differ.

This methodology allows for the estimation of profit sharing in vertical chains by properly modelling the contracting stage between manufacturers and retailers. We apply this methodology to analyse the effects of the “yogurt cartel” that prevailed in the French dairy dessert market between private label providers during the period 2006–2012. We find that data supports collusive behaviour between private label manufacturers, and lead to average price increase varying from 7.3% and 11.3%, according to the product category. We found an umbrella effect on dairy products sold under national brands at the wholesale level but not at the retail level. The cartel benefits manufacturers both for the sales of the national brand and private label products, while retailers lost profits over the private label products but gained profits over the national brand products. The cartel implies a relatively low decrease in consumer welfare—lower than the gain for the industry—such that the overall welfare effect of the cartel is positive.","Successive mergers have increased the concentration of the retail sector over the last 30 years, which has strengthened the buying power of strong retail chains (see Allain et al., 2017, Dobson et al., 2003). For instance, to countervail the buying power of the retail sector, manufacturers in many food markets reinforced their bargaining position with respect to retail chains through a vast consolidation movement in the early 2000s (European-Commission, 2014, OECD, 2014). The increase in concentration in both the manufacturing and the retail levels has resulted in higher prices paid by consumers and a higher risk of anticompetitive practices, such as cartel formation.==== One example of these practices is the French “yogurt cartel” case formed by the country's top eleven firms involved in the production of fresh dairy desserts.==== By setting up a cartel, dairy firms colluded explicitly on private label (PL)==== products through output restrictions and price setting, aiming to reduce competition and increase profits, which is prohibited by article 101(1) of the EC Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).====Collusion in an industry leads to market price increases that deserve greater attention in the literature. The impacts of collusion practices are often measured as the increase in price (often called overcharge) caused by a sellers’ cartel compared to a competitive benchmark market outcome.==== However, to quantify the impact of collusive behaviour in vertically related markets, price formation within the supply chain should be better investigated by explicitly taking into account the relationships between the different levels of the supply chain. This issue has been emphasized in the case of food markets by OECD (2014) and by Villas-Boas (2007), who states that “competition authorities should consider incorporating the role of retailers in upstream merger analyses, especially in the presence of increasingly consolidated retail food markets”. However, in most cases, merger evaluation methodologies do not take into account the vertical relationships between the manufacturing and the retailing levels with the exception of the competition authorities in Ireland that consider concentration along the supply chain in addition to the traditional market share analysis at the retail level (OECD, 2014). The impact on final prices paid by consumers is then incorrectly estimated and the impact on the industry is not disentangled from between the manufacturers and retailers. In order to properly assess the cartel damages, it is therefore important to explicitly consider not only the existence of retailers on downstream markets but also their economic strategies that can affect both upstream and downstream prices. In this respect, except for the pricing strategy for the products offered by the retailers, another main strategy concerns the products they offer in their stores and, in particular, their offer of private label (PL) products. PLs play an important role both in competition at the retail level but also in profit sharing. In fact, PLs were introduced in retail chains stores for two main strategic objectives. First, PLs are used by retailers to differentiate themselves from competing retailers (Berges-Sennou, 2006), and then to relax competition between retailers. Second, PLs affect profit sharing between manufacturers and retailers as they are used to reinforce a retailer's bargaining position with respect to their suppliers in wholesale price negotiations (see Mills (1995), for instance).====In this paper, we propose a structural econometric methodology based on recent developments in the applied industrial organization literature to better assess the impact of collusive behaviour in vertically-related industries, when wholesale prices are not observed. The main advantage of this methodology is to take into account profit sharing issues and their implication on the final prices paid by consumers. Our approach extends the structural econometric demand and supply model approaches which have been developed in order to better evaluate price increases due to collusive behaviour (see, for instance, Ivaldi and Verboven, 2005). Retailers are often considered as exogenous in the literature, such that their strategic behaviours are not taken into account. For instance, Dubé (2005) simulated the effect of hypothetical mergers in the carbonated soft drink market in one particular U.S. city (Denver). A first attempt to consider vertical relationships is the methodology developed in Bonnet and Dubois (2010). Their methodology assumes that all of the bargaining power is in the hand of the manufacturers, who can propose take-it-or-leave-it non-linear contracts to retailers and extract all of the bilateral profit. Therefore, their methodology cannot deal with profit sharing between manufacturers and retailers, and PL markets are considered as perfectly integrated. Rather, our econometric methodology is based on Nash bargaining game approaches, as in Draganska et al. (2010). Such a methodology allows us to properly model the existence of retailers’ bargaining power in the wholesale price decision and its incidence on profits, for both the manufacturing and the retailing firms. Bargaining frameworks have become more and more developed in recent empirical buyer-seller relationships within a number of different industries (Crawford and Yurukoglu, 2012, Grennan, 2013, Gowrisankaran et al., 2015, Ho and Lee, 2017),==== which enables margins to be recovered at both the manufacturing and the retailing levels. In our framework, manufacturers and retailers bargain bilaterally and simultaneously over linear wholesale price contracts. Our framework relies on the estimation of substitution patterns between brands—in particular between NBs and PLs—and between competing retailers. This is a key feature when analysing the bargaining position in the vertical chain as the relative power between producers and retailers depends on the loyalty of consumers to particular brands or retailers.==== This methodology can then be used to evaluate the impact of a collusive behaviour—such as price fixing or merger—on markets in the spirit of traditional merger simulation methodology (Budzinski and Ruhmer, 2009).====We apply this methodology to test the collusive behaviour of PL providers in the dairy dessert market using a one-year dataset of purchases in France and evaluate the implication on the final and wholesale prices. Contrary to the French competition authorities, we take into account the NB dairy desserts in the definition of the relevant market, given the strategic role of competition between PLs and NBs in this market. We find that the data support collusive behaviour between PL providers in this sector and that the cartel leads to price increases for PLs, varying from 7.3% for dairy desserts to 11.3% for yogurts. Results show that it is important to take into account NB dairy desserts in the relevant market definition, as the cartel also affects the prices of NBs and related margins at the manufacturing + and the retail levels. Indeed, when simulating a no-collusion scenario, we find an umbrella effect at the wholesale level: the wholesale prices of NBs increase with the collusion. However, the umbrella effect does not show up at the retailing level. We find that the higher NB wholesale prices are not transmitted into higher NB final prices because of the differentiation strategies of retailers. Therefore, the cartel benefits manufacturers both for the sales of the NBs and PLs while retailers lose profits over the PLs but gain profits over the NBs. Overall, industry profits are higher when PL providers collude and may even overcompensate for the loss of consumer surplus, which suggests that the cartel may not have led to a total welfare loss. Finally, we also show that when the cartel can also change the ability of retailers to negotiate with manufacturers, the impacts on prices and profits for both NBs and PLs are even stronger.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we develop the empirical strategy for the evaluation of economic impacts of collusive behaviour. We then apply this methodology to the “yogurt cartel” case and provide empirical results on the impact on prices, margins and surplus for manufacturers, retailers and consumers in Section 3.

Plaintiffs are privately informed about the expected judgment and their level of ability in controlling the lawyer. More attorney advertising increases case filings by plaintiffs with high or low ability to different extents such that the defendant's beliefs about the plaintiff's type change with the level of attorney advertising. How attorney advertising influences settlement outcomes then depends on whether the defendant offers a higher settlement offer to more able plaintiffs.","Lawyer advertising is very important for the workings of the legal system (e.g., as regards access to justice) and in terms of money spent within the legal system (e.g., Stone and Miceli, 2012, Stephen and Love, 2000). The regulation of attorney advertising varies markedly across jurisdictions and time (e.g., Calvani et al., 1988). For example, in the United States, a prohibition was in place until the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case ==== Arizona, 1977. Subsequently, lawyer advertising was permitted in the UK and, more recently, in other European countries (e.g., France).====Lawyer advertising continues to be controversial in most jurisdictions (Stawicki, 2007). In the vivid policy debate about the merits of attorney advertising, proponents argue that it is key for transmitting valuable information regarding both legal rights and legal services to the poor and uneducated segments of society. In the decision Bates v. State Barof Arizona 1977, the Supreme Court explains that “[s]tudies reveal that many persons do not obtain counsel even when they perceive a need… because of an inability to locate a competent attorney”. Engstrom (2011) and Parkinson and Neeley (2003), for example, also argue that the failure of poor and uneducated individuals to initiate legal claims might be primarily attributable to a lack of information about their rights and about how to find a lawyer.==== Opponents of attorney advertising argue that it harms the legal profession's reputation, decreases the trust in and quality of legal services, and excessively incites litigation (e.g., Brooks, 1994).====This paper analyzes the implications of informative attorney advertising for the level of the equilibrium settlement offer and the equilibrium probability of trial in a screening framework building on Bebchuk (1984).==== Our analysis starts from the notion that attorney advertising is critical for providing information to potential plaintiffs who were initially unaware of the existence of a legal claim or the availability of legal counsel for their cause. In our framework, a defendant makes a settlement offer to a lawyer hired by a plaintiff privately informed about the expected judgment at trial and an additional characteristic that is also relevant to the defendant. To adequately reflect the policy debate regarding attorney advertising, we distinguish between ==== and ==== plaintiffs, where low-ability potential plaintiffs are more likely to be initially unaware of the existence of a legal claim or the availability of legal counsel for their cause. In our analysis, the plaintiff's ability level is directly relevant to the defendant because more able plaintiffs have a stronger influence on their lawyer's decision about whether or not to accept a given settlement offer (to reflect that this type of plaintiff better understands legal arguments and the law involved and thus can more effectively control his lawyer).====We find that attorney advertising influences the defendant's optimal settlement offer and the probability of settlement. The intuition runs as follows: Although we assume that the defendant obtains a signal about plaintiff ability from interacting with the plaintiff in the context of pre-settlement events (e.g., the accident, negotiations, depositions), the defendant is only imperfectly informed about it when ultimately making the settlement offer. Because this plaintiff characteristic is important to the defendant for making a private cost minimizing settlement offer, the defendant's offer will be guided by his beliefs about whether the plaintiff's ability is high or low. The belief is influenced by attorney advertising because the relative importance of advertising to low-ability potential plaintiffs changes the composition of the population of plaintiffs. More advertising thus tilts the defendant's beliefs toward less able plaintiffs. When the distribution of expected judgments is skewed to the left, both the settlement offer and the settlement probability ==== in response to more attorney advertising.====In our extensions, we first briefly explain how attorney advertising influences deterrence in our setup. Next, we consider the scenario in which lawyers are compensated by the hour instead of by contingent fees. Attorney advertising is said to help poor and uneducated society members better know their rights and identify appropriate legal counsel. Clearly, the information obtained via advertising may be in vain when liquidity constraints prevent potential plaintiffs with low income from filing suit with a lawyer compensated by the hour. While the influence of advertising on defendant beliefs in this extension is similar to our baseline analysis, the agency issues in the plaintiff-lawyer relationship are different (hourly compensation distorts attorney incentives in favor of trials, whereas contingent fees distort attorney incentives toward pursuit of settlements). Thus, we propose distortion effects of attorney advertising that may depend on the lawyer's compensation contract.====The plan for the paper is as follows. After discussing the related literature in the next section, we will present the model in Section 3. Our main analysis is presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents two extensions.

With the increase in market uncertainty and the advancement of the legalization process, the probability of companies being involved in lawsuits has continued to increase. How does a company’s litigation experience affect its risk-taking? Is it “once bitten, twice shy” or will it be “take a nap, grow up with wisdom?” Furthermore, what strategies can be implemented by a company to enhance its risk-taking? Using the difference-in-differences method, this study adopts the data of listed companies from 2000 to 2015 to examine the impact of litigation on corporate risk-taking and its internal mechanism. Two main findings are obtained. First, the indicted experience significantly improves a company’s risk-taking. Second, this “learning effect” is embodied as “nonproductive activities,” and the accused enterprises can realize property right protection and risk-taking by reducing R&D investment and increasing rent-seeking investment. These findings are proven to be valid after a series of robust tests. The orientation of entrepreneurship is highly dependent on the institutional environment where a company is located. In the transitional period, truly enhancing the risk-taking of enterprises and giving play to the “productive function” of the entrepreneurial spirit are needed to continuously strengthen the system construction of a company’s operating environment and create a fair and just legal environment.","Corporate risk-taking directly determines the choice of corporate investment activities and is critical to business development and economic growth (Bargeron et al., 2010; Wang, 2012; Attig et al., 2013). At the macro-level, high-risk projects are often associated with high-tech innovations; if the project is successful, it can increase the productivity level of society, thereby promoting technological progress and accelerating the pace of social capital accumulation (Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 1997; John et al., 2008). At the micro-level, rational selection and risk taking can help companies improve performance, promote new product development, and actively respond to the challenges of changing economic conditions (Hilary and Hui, 2009). They are also important guarantees to enhance their ability to continuously innovate and to strengthen their core competition (Boubakri et al., 2013). Under the background of China’s implementation of innovation-driven development strategy and deepening supply structure reform, finding ways to effectively improve corporate risk-taking has become an important issue that China urgently needs to solve.====With the increase in market uncertainty and the advancement of the legalization process in recent years, litigation risk has become an important factor affecting corporate risk taking among many external uncertainties faced by enterprises(Pan et al., 2015). In 2015 alone, 504 Chinese A-share listed companies were involved in different types of litigation, accounting for 16 % of the total number of A-share listed companies.==== In the same year, 467 companies were involved in civil litigation; the total number of cases involved reached 1,760 and the total amount involved was as high as 887.3 billion yuan. Moreover, 856 cases were involved over 100 million yuan. Being involved in a lawsuit undoubtedly increases the risk of uncertainty faced by a company and limits its decision-making ability in terms of project investment and innovative behavior from the aspects of time cost (e.g., transferring and occupying enterprise energy) and capital cost (e.g., exacerbating corporate financing constraints). In turn, the company’s risk-taking ability is affected. In reality, the involved lawsuit may have two opposite effects on the risk taking of an enterprise. On the one hand, the involved lawsuit may have a “deterrent effect” on the enterprise, that is, once the enterprise is involved in the lawsuit, it increases the probability of its own lawsuit. Subjective assessment is likely to reduce market uncertainty by reducing investment in high-risk projects, and corporate risk-taking will be low. On the other hand, the lawsuit may induce the “learning effect” of the enterprise, and the enterprise achieves such an effect through various channels. The risk-taking level is improved, and the enterprise’s risk-taking is strengthened. Accordingly, what kind of impact do the company’s complaints have on corporate risk taking? After going through the lawsuit, would it be “once bitten, twice shy” or “eat a meal, grow a wisdom” for the company involved? What is the mechanism and path of this? These questions must be answered immediately.====In view of the importance of corporate risk-taking, many studies have investigated its influencing factors. In the literature, the academic circles mainly follow the two clues of external institutional arrangements and internal governance mechanisms. Some studies have focused on the impacts of external institutional arrangements on corporate risk-taking. These documents found that good investor protection (La Porta et al., 1998), legal bills (Bargeron et al., 2010), and cultural values (Griffin et al., 2014) have important influences on the risk-taking decision of micro-subjects. Other studies reported that, in the internal governance mechanism of enterprises, ownership structure (Attig et al., 2013), the characteristics of the board of directors (Wang, 2012), and management layer incentives (Low, 2009) can also affect corporate risk-taking. The bulk of decision making in an enterprise is made by “executives,” and as such, the demographic and psychological characteristics of the executives (e.g., gender, age, and experience) cause different risk propensities for individuals (Barber and Odean, 2001). The manager’s psychological cognitive bias (e.g., overconfidence, risk appetite, and psychological account) also affects the perception of risk to a certain extent (Yu et al., 2013). Few studies have been conducted on the impact of corporate litigation on corporate risk taking due to limited data sources. Hence, this study collects the corporate litigation data of listed companies in China and explores the above issues to make up for and expand people’s perception of this aspect.====This study examines the impact and logic mechanism of litigation on corporate risk exposure employing the corporate litigation data and related financial data of the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2000 to 2015, using the empirical method of the generalized difference-in-difference model. We find that litigation significantly improves corporate risk-taking. In other words, litigation does not reduce the risk choice preferences of enterprises, but they learn how to deal with and bear risks in the process. However, further research demonstrates that companies tend to reduce R&D investment and increase rent-seeking investment when lawsuits are involved. Therefore, although the companies involved in the litigation make radical project investment choices, the “learning effect” in the corporate litigation experience is mainly reflected in the investment security through rent-seeking activities, which negatively encourages enterprises to bottom out. Competition even falls into the prisoner’s dilemma, which is not conducive to the long-term development of an economy. This discovery suggests policy requirements for strengthening the institutional construction of the business environment and creating a fair and just legal environment.====Unlike the existing literature, the marginal contribution of this paper is reflected in three aspects. First, this paper deepens and expands the related research on corporate risk-taking. Existing literature analyzes corporate risk-taking from the perspectives of external institutional arrangements, internal governance mechanisms, and personal characteristics (Barber and Odean, 2001; La Porta et al., 1998). In comparison, our work is based on the typical increase in litigation risk during China’s transition period. Based on stylized facts and results, we examine the mechanism of the impact of corporate litigation on risk-taking, which can help gain a deeper understanding of the factors affecting corporate risk exposure. Second, the findings of this paper can help us further understand and evaluate corporate risk-taking from a macro-level. Such an evaluation should strengthen the investigation of corporate behavior and external institutional environment. The improvement of corporate risk-taking is indeed beneficial in enhancing corporate performance and is effective at the micro-level of enterprises. However, if corporate risk-taking is improved due to the destruction of the institutional environment, even the rational response to the imperfect system can also be harmful from the state at the macro level. This discovery has certain significance for other developing countries. Third, this paper enriches the literature on the results of corporate litigation. Based on the litigation results, it has been asserted that the risk of corporate litigation has significant influences on the pricing of audit fees (Venkataraman et al., 2008), corporate information disclosure policy (Rogers and Stocken, 2005), and innovation activities (Pan et al., 2015), debt costs (Wang et al., 2016) and corporate name changes (Xie et al., 2017). However, the literature on the impact of litigation on corporate risk- taking is limited. The analysis of this paper not only provides empirical evidence for the relationship between corporate litigation and risk-taking, but also examines the internal mechanism. In turn, this helps us understand the transmission mechanism of external uncertainty risk to corporate risk-taking behavior.====The structural arrangement of the rest of this paper is divided into several parts. The second part introduces the theoretical analysis and research hypothesis. The third part discusses the model, variables, and data. The fourth part presents the empirical regression results. The fifth part discusses the test of the impact mechanism, and the final part provides the conclusion and policy implications.",Litigation and corporate risk taking: Evidence from Chinese listed firms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819300997,16 November 2019,2019,Research Article,156.0

We also consider whether unlitigated agencies change their practices due to the threat of litigation, but, like ====, are unable to identify causal evidence of such threat effects. We suggest that, in the spirit of ","In the aftermath of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, renewed attention was directed to the demographic composition of law enforcement agencies. In the summer of 2015, 2 out of 3 residents of Ferguson, but only 3 out of its 53 police officers, were black (U.S. Department of and Justice, 2016). This disparity gave rise to questions about whether increasing the proportion of black officers on the Ferguson police force, or in law enforcement agencies more generally, would lead to different public safety outcomes. On the one hand, increasing the proportion of nonwhite police officers may lead to an increased acceptance of policing, fewer instances of the use of force, and fewer citizen complaints in nonwhite communities (Tyler, 2005), leading in turn to increases in the reporting of crime by nonwhite victims, and in the willingness of civilians to cooperate with police investigations into these crimes (Miller and Segal, 2018). Nonwhite officers may also exert greater effort, or be better equipped, to clear crimes in largely nonwhite neighborhoods. These mechanisms might lead to decreases in nonwhite crime victimization. On the other hand, increasing the proportion of nonwhite police officers may lead to decreases in policing quality if nonwhite applicants to police agencies are less qualified than white applicants, and/or if the effort of white officers is reduced due to morale effects (Lott, 2000). These mechanisms might lead to increases in nonwhite and/or white crime victimization. Detecting the presence of these potentially offsetting and racially heterogeneous effects is a challenging exercise.====Existing work on this question has generally not attempted to identify the specific causal pathways through which agency racial composition may affect policing outcomes, seeking instead to estimate average effects of agency racial composition on outcomes such as reported offense and arrest rates (Lott, 2000, McCrary, 2007). Yet analyzing the effect of the racial composition of law enforcement agencies on these outcomes is complicated by the endogeneity of hiring and retention practices to other agency-specific factors that may also affect outcomes. To achieve identification, researchers have sought to leverage the incidence and timing of affirmative action litigation (Lott, 2000, McCrary, 2007). This work has yielded inconsistent results regarding the effects of racial diversity on policing outcomes. Existing work has not, however, implemented recent econometric advances in difference-in-differences estimation.====In this paper, we replicate and extend the work of Lott (2000) and McCrary (2007) using modern difference-in-differences methods, including the difference-in-differences decomposition method developed by Goodman-Bacon (2019) as well as the generalized synthetic controls method developed by Xu (2017). Ultimately, like McCrary (2007), we do not find a significant average effect of court-imposed affirmative action plans on the rates of reported offenses or reported offenses cleared by arrest. We also extend the effort of McCrary (2007) to analyze whether unlitigated agencies change their practices due to the threat of litigation, raising concerns of stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) violations. We estimate whether the total number of agencies receiving court-imposed affirmative action plans at time ==== has a differential impact on the rates of reported offenses or offenses cleared by arrest for agencies that will never be litigated, relative to agencies that will eventually be litigated. Like McCrary (2007), we find little evidence of spillover effects. Finally, we return to the question of identifying the specific and possibly racially heterogeneous causal mechanisms linking affirmative action litigation and public safety outcomes, suggesting that this would be a productive avenue for future research.",Estimating Effects of Affirmative Action in Policing: A Replication and Extension,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819302686,15 November 2019,2019,Research Article,157.0

Next, we investigate the impacts of PE actions on the external debt financing, and show a significant decrease in external debt financing associated with firms receiving AS compared to those receiving non-AS.

Public enforcement involves “the use of public agents (inspectors, tax auditors, police, prosecutors) to detect and to sanction violators of legal rule” (Polinsky and Shavell, 2000: 45), whereas private enforcement is mainly initiated by self-motivated private parties who seek compensation or rescission through litigation. There is a long-standing debate over the relative advantages of these two enforcement mechanisms, but to date no consensus has been reached.====In the real world, different countries adopt different combinations of private enforcement and public enforcement. For example, the U.S. adopts a multienforcer approach, which means that private and public enforcement are used jointly (Rose, 2010). The enforcement authority is therefore divided among different parties, including: (1) governmental agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (Velikonja, 2016),==== state regulators (Rose and LeBlanc, 2013) and the Department of Justice; (2) quasi-governmental entities, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Birdthistle and Henderson, 2013); and (3) private parties, such as investors who can resort to securities class actions to target potential violations (Choi and Pritchard, 2016). The aforementioned parties may take action independently or jointly.==== The multienforcer approach minimizes the risk of underenforcement and selective enforcement and thus contributes to a high enforcement intensity, which is referred to as “American exceptionalism” (Coffee, 2007).==== However, this approach is also criticized for overenforcement, and it is suggested to place private enforcement under public oversight (Rose, 2008).====Compared to the U.S., China adopts a fundamentally different approach in which public regulators monopolize securities law enforcement.==== Public agencies that are responsible for enforcing securities law mainly include the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and its 38 regional offices (ROs), the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE)==== . Whereas public enforcement in China indeed performs its functions to a certain extent by, for example, imposing significant costs on fraudulent firms, it is usually claimed in the literature that it underdeters securities fraud and fails to sustain a healthy stock market (Allen et al., 2005; Humphery-Jenner, 2013; Pistor and Xu, 2005).====Despite its contributions, the current literature on China’s stock market faces a serious problem: it overlooks the recent regulatory reform of securities law enforcement, particularly the efforts of the 38 ROs. ROs have played an increasingly important role in law enforcement since October 2013, when the CSRC issued a notice granting its 38 ROs the authority to impose administrative sanctions for minor infractions.==== ROs now account for more than 70 % of the CSRC’s staff and nearly 50 % of its enforcement actions (Xu et al., 2017). We are therefore left with an incomplete picture regarding law enforcement in China’s stock markets if these changes are ignored.====This study fills this gap in the literature by systematically examining the recent reform in the securities law enforcement regime. More specifically, we first use the pilot project launched by the CSRC, which delegates to ROs in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen the authority to impose administrative sanctions, as an external shock, and then investigate market reactions to the increase in public enforcement intensity. The event study shows that only the portfolios of shares issued by firms within the jurisdiction of Guangdong and Shenzhen ROs experience positive and significant ARs of 0.445 % and 0.434 %, respectively.====Second, we collect 153 administrative sanctions and 424 non-administrative sanctions against listed companies for informational misconduct, which were issued by the CSRC and its ROs between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018, and employ a shock-based research framework of event studies==== to estimate the stock market reactions to these public enforcement activities.==== One innovation of this study is that we examine the market reactions to the entire administrative enforcement proceeding, which usually consist of three stages, i.e., investigation notice, preliminary decision and final decision. Sanctioned firms make corresponding announcements, and their share prices will adjust to the information disclosed.====When focusing on the effects of the administrative sanctions (regardless of whether they are issued by the CSRC or its ROs), we find that the portfolio of stocks issued by sanctioned firms experience a significant and negative AR (around -12.03 % over the (-1,5) event window) when announcing that they are under investigation by the CSRC or its ROs. This is the first time that the information of their misconduct is officially disclosed to the market. By contrast, the stock prices experience positive and significant ARs when these firms announce that they receive the preliminary or final decisions. When listed companies announce that they receive non-administrative sanctions, we find that the stocks of sanctioned firms experience, on average, a negative and significant AR of approximately -0.56 % on the event date.====Third, we further explore the difference between the impacts of administrative sanctions and non-administrative sanctions on firms’ external debt financing. To reduce heterogeneity within the sample, the sample employed only comprises sanctions issued by ROs. Those firms receiving administrative sanctions are in the treatment group, and those receiving non-administrative sanctions are in the control group. Our empirical evidence suggests that companies sanctioned administratively experience a larger decrease in the sizes of outstanding long-term loans and corporate bonds when compared with those sanctioned non-administratively.====Finally, we examine the determinants of administrative enforcement action in the sample of shares sanctioned by ROs. Given the fact that administrative sanctions brought about much higher costs for sanctioned firms than non-administrative sanctions (as measured by the stock price reactions and reduction of external financing), listed companies have strong incentives to lobby for a more lenient sanctions. Our regression analysis shows that larger firms enjoy a relatively lower likelihood of being sanctioned administratively, but neither governmental ownership nor political participations plays a significant role.====Our paper is closely connected to the literature on the impact of public enforcement actions.==== First, several studies have shown that, in sophisticated stock markets, share prices react negatively to the announcement of enforcement proceedings. For example, Armour et al. (2017) document a -1.68 % AR using British data, and Karpoff et al. (2008b) report a -9.60 % AR. However, Chen et al. (2005) only find a very weak market reaction, with a -1.12 % AR using early Chinese data. Our study employs an updated sample and finds a much stronger market reaction of a similar magnitude to that in the U.S. Second, aside from the stock price depression, enforcement actions also bring about other consequences, including increased management turnover (Karpoff et al., 2008a), reduced economic performance (Bai et al., 2010) and increased cost of capital (Chava et al., 2010). Our study complements the literature by showing that more serious enforcement proceedings, as represented by the administrative sanctions, tend to reduce formal external debt financing to a larger degree, as proxied by the size of outstanding long-term loans and corporate bonds. Finally, our empirical finding that firm size is negatively correlated with the likelihood of receiving more severe sanctions contributes to a growing literature showing that firm size matters for regulatory outcomes (Cumming et al., 2015).====The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background of public enforcement in China’s stock markets and constructs the hypotheses. Section 3 discusses the sample and reports the descriptive statistics.

Drawing on a novel dataset of bankruptcy reorganizations from Slovenia and exploiting variation in the incidence of debt-to-equity conversion across firms, we provide the first empirical analysis of the role of debt-to-equity conversion in bankruptcy reorganization as a determinant of post-bankruptcy firm survival. To address endogeneity concerns, we use a plethora of controls and fixed effects, quantify the sensitivity of our estimates to selection on unobservables, and rely on instrumental variable methods. We find that debt-to-equity conversion is robustly negatively associated with prospects of post-bankruptcy firm failure. Our findings provide a novel input into ongoing debates about the appropriate design of corporate bankruptcy institutions.","Debt-to-equity conversion (DEC, in short) is a frequently utilized legal tool for alleviation of financial distress of firms nearing or experiencing insolvency (see, e.g., Chatterji and Hedges, 2001; Gilson et al., 1990; Gilson, 1990; James, 1995). From the creditors' standpoint, DEC is often an attractive mode of debtor's financial restructuring. Without DEC, creditors can often hope to recover only a small fraction of their claims. By reducing the company's overall debt burden, DEC increases the prospects of claim recovery, even for creditors who choose not to take part in DEC. DEC further allows creditors to obtain control over the ailing business. DEC thereby provides creditors with the upside that the business will recover and that the value of their equity will grow.====Institutionally, DEC can take place either during out-of-court financial restructuring or, when enabled by the legislative framework, within in-court bankruptcy reorganization proceedings. Empirical evidence on the effect of DEC on the performance of financially restructured business, however, is scant. Especially little is known about the consequences of bankruptcy-based DEC for post-bankruptcy firm outcomes. The corresponding lack of empirical evidence is unsettling because DEC has been routinely considered, or even advocated, as a mechanism of corporate bankruptcy resolution (Claessens et al., 2001; Hart, 2006; Laryea, 2010; Erić and Stošić, 2015).====In theory, DEC is expected to aid post-bankruptcy firm performance for two primary reasons. By lessening the debtor's debt burden without an accompanying decrease in the firm's assets, DEC instantaneously strengthens the firm's balance sheet. An improved debt-to-equity ratio in turn enhances the firm's borrowing position as well as the firm's status vis-à-vis the customers, suppliers, and other business partners. In addition, by changing the firm's ownership structure, DEC holds potential to improve decision-making at a critical juncture for the struggling business.====Yet at the same time, DEC is not a guarantee that the business will succeed ex post. The firm's new owners (creditors who opted for DEC) may come in conflict with the old owners or management, or continue to repeat errors that possibly contributed to the firm's pre-bankruptcy turmoil. In addition, DEC may be interpreted as a signal that the distressed business is especially cash-strapped, an event that can adversely affect the firm's market valuation. Finally, the debtor bears the organizational and financial expenses associated with DEC. For all these reasons, how exactly DEC affects post-bankruptcy firm outcomes is ultimately an empirical question.====In the present paper, we follow this line of reasoning to empirically investigate the relationship between DEC in bankruptcy reorganization and the prospects of post-bankruptcy firm failure. To this end, we draw on a newly assembled dataset of bankruptcy reorganizations from Slovenia, a post-socialist EU member state where business bankruptcy has been a much debated policy topic since early transition (see, e.g., Gray and Stiblar 1993). In Slovenia, DEC in bankruptcy organization has been legally possible since late 1990s. A comprehensive 2008 reform of insolvency legislation solidified DEC as a restructuring tool used in bankruptcy reorganization practice by articulating and refining the key procedural rules of DEC. However, not all firms pursuing bankruptcy reorganization since 2008 have opted for DEC. We exploit the resulting uneven implementation of DEC across bankrupt firms to examine the role of DEC as a determinant of post-bankruptcy firm survival.====Given the existence of variation in DEC across bankrupt firms, the key challenge in estimating the effect of DEC on post-bankruptcy firm survival stems from the possibility that the creditors' decision to pursue DEC is systematically related to unobserved firm characteristics that also affect the firm's prospects of post-bankruptcy survival. To tackle the corresponding endogeneity concerns, we utilize multiple empirical approaches and estimation methods. The detailed nature of our data facilitates the inclusion of a plethora of controls and fixed affects. In a subset of our analysis, we rely on recently developed methods to quantify the sensitivity of our estimates to unobserved heterogeneity (Oster, 2017). Finally, we estimate our models using instrumental variable-based approaches, in an attempt to isolate the exogenous part of variation in the occurrence of DEC across firms. The application of instrumental variable methods in addition allows us to directly test the appropriateness of the assumption of exogeneity of our focal DEC indicator.====We find that DEC is associated with reduced prospects of post-bankruptcy firm failure (or, equivalently, increased prospects of post-bankruptcy firm survival). This finding is robust to alternative model specifications and estimation approaches and is not driven by selection on unobservables. The use of instrumental variable techniques further indicates that, conditional on the full set of included controls, we cannot reject the assumption of exogeneity of our focal regressor. The resultant analysis indicates that our estimates of the effect of DEC on post-bankruptcy performance may even be consistent with a causal interpretation. Our analysis thereby provides support in favor of the use of DEC as a means to restructuring of financially distressed but economically viable businesses.====More generally, our paper adds to and bridges two broad strands of the literature. The first is the voluminous literature on corporate financial restructuring (see, e.g., Gilson 2010; Bowman and Singh, 1993; Bowman et al., 1999). Within this literature, the consequences of DEC for firm outcomes have been comparatively underexplored. This is in particular true with regard to the repercussions of DEC that takes place within the formal bankruptcy framework, that is, in firms already pursuing bankruptcy reorganization. The second strand constitutes the literature on post-bankruptcy firm performance. Research on firms emerging from bankruptcy reorganization has focused predominantly on publicly traded U.S. firms (e.g., Alderson and Betker, 1999; Bandopadhyaya and Jaggia, 2001; LoPucki and Doherty, 2015; Hotchkiss et al., 2008; Barniv et al., 2002; Denis and Rodgers, 2007; Aivazian and Zhou, 2012, Hotchkiss, 1995). Notably less is known about the determinants of post-bankruptcy firm outcomes in other jurisdictions, even though the design of corporate bankruptcy institutions has been at the heart of policy debates across the globe (see, e.g., European Law Institute, 2017; Cirmizi et al., 2012; Claessens et al., 2001; Hart, 2006).==== Importantly, to our knowledge, regardless of the examined jurisdiction, no contribution to date has investigated the consequences of DEC during in-court bankruptcy reorganization proceedings for post-bankruptcy firm outcomes.====Our paper takes a step toward filling these gaps in the literature by offering the first empirical scrutiny of DEC in bankruptcy reorganization as a determinant of post-bankruptcy firm survival. With regard to the scope of our inquiry, we utilize a novel, fine-grained dataset on bankruptcy reorganization plans and firms from a comparatively under-researched jurisdiction that has deliberately modeled its corporate bankruptcy reorganization framework after U.S. Chapter 11. Given the often considerable similarity of bankruptcy reorganization frameworks across countries, especially those that have attempted to emulate the U.S. insolvency legislation (see, e.g., Wessels, 2011; Eidenmüller, 2016; Warren and Westbrook, 2009: 625), we would expect our findings to extend well beyond the Slovenian borders. Methodologically, our analysis advances the existing research on predictors of post-bankruptcy firm outcomes by explicitly attempting to address issues of causality.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief institutional background on Slovenian bankruptcy reorganization proceedings and the corresponding legal framework for conversion of debt to equity. Subsequent sections introduce our data, develop our empirical methodology, and present the results.

However, measures of discourse based on algorithmic results typically have no intuitive meaning or obvious relationship to humanly observed discourse. Such measures of discourse must be carefully validated before relied on and interpreted. We examine several common measures of discourse based on algorithmic results, and propose a number of ways to validate them in the setting of Federal Open Market Committee meetings. We also suggest that validation techniques may be used as a principled approach to model selection and parameterization.","Scholars variously posit that deliberative discourse allows us to reach consensus, to aggregate information, or to recognize the dignity of participants and confer legitimacy on policy outcomes. Deliberative discourse, indeed, may be viewed as the foundation for much of cooperative society, central to the operation of both formal and informal social institutions. For this reason, scholars have long endeavored to measure the quality of deliberation and its determinants. The central challenge has been converting naturally high-dimensional textual records into plausibly objective and tractable data that captures that which we observe in humanly understood deliberation.====Early attempts to measure discourse involved hand-coding transcripts with categories based on the judgments of researchers (e.g., Steiner et al., 2004). Though the discrete coding categories were obviously imperfect and subjective, they could engage with a wide variety of questions and were easily interpretable because they were grounded in directly observable features of discourse. However, hand-coding discourse is slow, expensive, and often subjective. With improvements of computing power, research turned to using count-based measures and automated dictionary methods. Though more scalable than hand classifications, such methods are limited in what they can capture. They assume, in effect, extremely strong priors about what the relevant keywords or features of a discussion might be, and in this sense tend to rely on authors’ subjective judgments.====Over the last ten years, developments in machine learning seemed to offer an attractive solution: new methods that can be used to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of textual data in plausibly objective ways and produce quantitative data that researchers can then manipulate to produce measures of discourse. Innovative works such as Hansen et al. (2018) (hereafter HMP) and Parthasarathy et al. (2019) (hereafter PRP) introduce one of the most popular machine learning approaches, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), to the literature on deliberation.====LDA is an unsupervised algorithm that posits each document can be represented as a mixture over a discrete number of topics. The model estimates how each document mixes over the topics, and those distributions over topics can subsequently be analyzed using standard numerical methods. Thus, we might see distance measures applied to the distributions of two documents to capture how similar the statements were, or regressions run over topic vectors to determine influence. Authors often validate that the topic estimates generated by LDA are plausible and interpretable. But rarely do they validate the measures of discourse themselves. They tend not to show, in other words, that the discourse measures translate into something humanly interpretable in the world of deliberation. That is the primary concern of this paper.====As a preliminary point, we emphasize that simply because the primitive output of a topic model is valid, it does not mechanically follow that deliberative measures ==== from that topic model validate. To see this, consider a simple example. Suppose we have two speakers and that we estimate a model with three topics/dimensions. Further suppose that the primitive model output is valid, so that the estimated topics and their loadings for each speaker accord with our understanding of what was spoken. Let ==== denote the distribution over the three topics for speaker ==== and ==== denote the vector for speaker ====. If we attempted to measure whether these two speakers focused on the same issues by generating an indicator for whether they load most heavily on the same topic, we would conclude that they did not focus on the same issues. Yet plainly the distributions over topics were similar: they both devoted substantially equal attention to all topics.====More sophisticated measures, such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence (or similarity), do not fully escape similar problems. As noted below, that measure is based on the the ratio of two probabilities. This makes the measure sensitive to topics with very low loadings. To continue with our example, suppose ==== and ====, so that the speakers share the dominant topic, but speaker ==== devotes marginally more attention to the second than the third topic. The Kullback-Leibler divergence, ====, between these two speakers is 0.38. Now suppose that ====, so that the two speakers no longer share a dominant topic, and speaker ==== devotes notably more attention to the third topic, and notably less to the first topic. Most observers would say the second set of statements relate to each other less than the first set of statements. Yet the Kullback-Leibler would tell us the opposite. The divergence for the second set of statements is 0.34. This anomaly is due to the sensitivity of the measure to topics with very low loadings.====To advance our point, we take two classic questions in the deliberation literature and attempt to validate the methods used by innovative papers. HMP aim to measure the diversity of views expressed in the course of deliberation. For deliberation to achieve many of its benefits, members must be able to contribute to debates freely and sincerely, yet they might not do so due to career concerns (e.g., Visser and Swank, 2007). HMP develop measures of discourse conformism based on LDA output. PRP’s work, in turn, examines leadership and influence in discourse, probing the extent to which those outcomes condition on gender. Equity is another important value to deliberation, and PRP likewise develop innovative measures of discourse based on the output of LDA.====We compile the key discourse measures used by these two papers and pursue a range of strategies in an attempt to validate them as intuitively interpretable. Following HMP, we develop a dataset of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) transcripts, extract text from the PDFs, clean the text, and parse the text by speaker. We then use this text to develop measures of deliberation based on HMP and PRP and attempt to validate them in a variety of ways. On the whole, the key measures validate remarkably well.==== We do not suggest that the validation strategies we pursue in this paper are exhaustive. Different settings and measures will lend themselves to a wide range of options depending on the desired interpretations and data availability. However, we demonstrate that there exist immediately intuitive validation options which might reasonably be expected of authors working in the space of abstracted, lower-dimensional representations of deliberative text.====As a secondary exercise, we suggest how validation may be used as an approach to model selection and parameterization. Even unsupervised learning methods require parameter selection, and those selections can vastly change the results flowing from the model. In LDA, for instance, the researcher must select the number of dimensions to model. One wants, therefore, a principled method of parameter selection that is results-independent. Several such approaches exist, though they typically focus on how well the model fits the underlying data. That may be appropriate in some contexts. However, the resulting paramaterization may not correspond with the model that produces the most interpretable and humanly understandable results. We suggest a validation-based approach to model selection. Under this approach, researchers search over model parameterizations and select the parameterization that produces the most valid measures, independent of the results.====The balance of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 discusses how LDA has been used in the literature, Section 3 introduces the details of HMP and PRP and the discourse measures they use, Section 4 attempts various strategies to validate these measures, Section 5 discusses the sensitivity of results to model selection and how validity measures can be used as a principled approach, and Section 6 concludes.",Measuring discourse by algorithm,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819302571,13 November 2019,2019,Research Article,160.0

The basic result from these earlier studies is that crime guns tended to flow out of weak-law states and into strict-law states. This paper builds on these earlier studies by employing previously unavailable ATF data on crime gun recoveries for multiple years and with information on the ‘time to crime’ aspects of gun recovery. Furthermore, a larger scope of state gun laws is considered. Using the gravity model of trade to model crime gun flows, the empirical results find robust results for five state gun laws that are negatively related to interstate crime gun exports: state laws requiring inspections of federally licensed dealers, required permits or licenses for gun purchases, prohibiting individuals with domestic violence-related restraining orders from possessing guns, required reporting of lost or stolen firearms by gun owners, and laws granting local authorities with discretion in deciding whether to grant a concealed carry permit. Furthermore, estimated coefficients for various state gun laws are significantly larger (in absolute terms) when short time to crime gun data are used in comparison to data for all crime gun flows (regardless of time to crime). Given a short time to crime aspect is considered by law enforcement as a key indicator of illegal gun trafficking, previous research by ==== and ==== likely underestimated the relationship between state gun laws and the movement of crime guns between states.","In 2015 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) reported that 271,018 guns were recovered from crime scenes and were submitted for a trace to determine when and where they were first purchased. Of these, 190,538 (about 70 percent) were successfully traced to the original purchase location.==== Given the location where these guns were recovered, a total of 53,548 of them (about 28 percent) were purchased in a different state. The ATF analyzes the movement of these ‘crime guns’ along with a ‘time-to-crime’ (TTC) measure, equal to the time that elapsed between the original purchase of the gun and when it was recovered at a crime scene. A short TTC (under three years) is a strong indicator of illegal gun trafficking, (Department of the Treasury, 2000). By this definition, 11,556 guns may have been trafficked between states in 2015. This movement of crime guns between states is a concern to state government officials and is the focus of this paper.====Among the factors related to the flow of crime guns between states are the differences in state gun laws that govern who is allowed to purchase a firearm, the process involved in purchases, and laws regarding the oversight of gun dealers. Previous research by Kahane (2013) and Knight (2013) produced empirical evidence that crime gun flows were related to differential state gun laws with crime guns flowing from weak-law states into strong-law states. Both of these previously published papers used ATF crime gun tracing data from 2009, the only year available at the time. Since the publication of these two papers the ATF has released substantially more data and greater details about the TTC for crime gun recoveries.====The goal of this paper is threefold. First, with the availability of multiple years of ATF trace data, a more robust empirical estimation will be implemented. Second, given data regarding the time-to-crime, this information will be used to estimate more precisely the relationship of various state gun laws on the movement of guns that were more likely trafficked.==== And third, the Kahane (2013) and Knight (2013) papers studied the effects of ten state gun laws on the movement of crime guns. These laws were identified in the Mayors Against Illegal Guns (2010) publication as being key factors in curbing illegal gun trafficking. This paper expands upon this list of laws and considers the relationship of sixteen state gun laws on the movement of crime guns between states.====The basic findings strongly support the earlier work by Kahane (2013) and Knight (2013) that differential state gun laws are correlated with the flow of crime guns between states with guns flowing out of states with weak gun laws and into states with strong gun laws. The focus on guns with a short TTC produced estimated effects for several state gun laws that were significantly larger in magnitude than those found for all traced guns regardless of their time to crime. This result suggests that the estimated relationship of various state gun laws on crime gun flow discussed in Kahane (2013) and Knight (2013) were likely underestimates. Lastly, the present research finds a larger number of laws that are related to crime gun flows than what was found in the earlier research. Key laws include those that put greater oversight on gun dealer behavior (e.g. state required inspections of federally licensed dealers) and laws that put greater oversight on buyers (such as requiring purchase permits and mandatory reporting of lost or stolen guns).",State gun laws and the movement of crime guns between states,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014481881930064X,8 November 2019,2019,Research Article,161.0

We focus on purchase transactions in order not to face the many reasons that can force investors to close their position. Our results suggest that insiders generate an excess return over the SBF120 index on the short run. An outsider mimicking insiders’ actions can generate similar profits. This implies that their informational advantage is rather short-lived. However, both of them fail to beat simulated random investors in general. Our findings highlight that the outperformance is rather stock-specific: insiders beat random investors for some stocks. We also disentangle management from non-management insiders and show that non-management insiders generate a lower average excess return than management insiders. Our simulation setup however shows that none of the groups is able to beat random investors for all the stocks, even if management insiders outperform the simulated series in more cases than non-management insiders.","Since corporate insiders are legally required to release all their transactions, many investors and speculators are meticulously following what insiders are doing. As a result, countless financial professionals, who are outsiders, analyze corporate insiders’ recent transactions in order to infer information on price movements. As a consequence, outsiders are prone to process this information and make decisions upon it.====This paper contributes to the broad literature on insiders’ performance. The literature has partly tried to provide answers to this question. Lorie and Niederhoffer (1968) show that the analysis of insider transactions’ data can be valuable and profitable in the U.S. stock market. Jaffe (1974); Finnerty (1976) and Madden (1979a, b) further demonstrate that insider traders were able to make positive, mainly large, trading profits, and that outsiders could also earn profits by simply mimicking the trading of insiders following the public release of insider open-market transactions data. Moreover, after the end of the 80 s, the majority of studies (Seyhun, 1986; Benesh and Pari, 1987; Rozeff and Zaman, 1988; Seyhun, 1988, 1990; Lin and Howe, 1990; Lakonishok and Lee, 2001) demonstrate two main elements compared to previous research. First, insiders are still able to make abnormal profits, but these profits are not particularly large. Second, outsiders mimicking them are not able to earn abnormal returns, net of transaction costs. More recently, researchers have presented similar findings concerning the U.S. stock markets (Tavakoli et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2012; Knewtson and Nofsinger, 2014; Tamersoy et al., 2014): Insiders are still able to make abnormal returns from their transactions, but these abnormal returns are very small. In addition, research studies conducted on the German stock market (Klinge et al., 2005; Betzer and Theissen, 2009; Stotz, 2006; Dymke and Walter, 2008; Linnertová and Deev, 2015), on the Canadian stock market (Morris and Boubacar, 2018), on the Australian stock market (Foley et al., 2016), and on the British stock market (Pope et al., 1990) tend to confirm the same evidence: Corporate legal insiders are able to make abnormal returns. However, it is interesting to note that some studies present opposite findings. Indeed, Eckbo and Smith (1998), focusing on the Oslo Stock exchange from January 1985 to December 1992, find evidence of zero or even negative abnormal returns, over a 6-month holding period or less. They also show that stock markets are becoming more and more efficient as a whole on the short term, making it more difficult for insiders to benefit from private knowledge and/or information, and almost impossible for outsiders to display any abnormal return simply by mimicking them.====Overall, some key findings emerge from all these studies. First, it seems that there is information content in corporate insider trading transactions, as insiders are able to earn abnormal profits. Second, individual investors who only observe and then mimic the behavior of corporate insiders cannot really benefit from this strategy and earn abnormal returns. Third, all insiders’ transactions do not carry the same type of information: some of them can be useful and other irrelevant, depending, for instance, on the nature of the transaction, i.e., buy or sell trade.====In addition, the common law and regulations define the insider trading activity as an act of exploiting and abusing one’s role in an organization, in order to gain information and knowledge, to lucratively trade in financial markets. As such, insider trading activity is construed in a limited and narrow meaning to signify situations where an individual is making transactions using privileged, private, and/or price sensitive knowledge for financial purpose. However, it can also more generally refer to all buys and sells of a corporate insider, regardless of whether she is using such type of private information or not. Our paper is based on the broader interpretation, considering all buys and sells. As a consequence, any distinction between legal and illegal insider purchase activities will be dismissed, assuming that illegal insider trading is either rare or efficiently addressed by the authorities. It is also almost impossible to precisely discover whether or not an insider is trading using private and restricted information; it seems natural that any corporate insider would know her company better than any other outsider and that they would have access to private information, even unconsciously.====In this paper, we aim to contribute to and extend the existing literature by focusing for the first time on corporate insiders’ transactions on the French stock market. In addition, it uses a different methodology for analyzing insiders’ transactions, focusing only on purchases, and leaving out sale transactions which may be considered as misleading and which lack real interpretation. Furthermore, this paper classifies corporate insiders’ transactions in different groups based on the position of the insiders in the organization, i.e., management versus non-management. We also contribute significantly to the debate by comparing insider trading to random traders and assess their performance. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to focus on the French stock market and analyzing the outperformance of insiders as compared to any random investor.====The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 details the theoretical background, the hypothesis development and the relation to the existing literature. Section 3 is devoted to data and descriptive statistics.

A main purpose of such rules is to deter socially inefficient behavior generating negative externalities. Under the so-called strict liability rule, tortfeasors are required to compensate the harm they caused irrespective of precautions or circumstances. Under the negligence rule, they are required to compensate if their behavior fell short of some legal standard of conduct given the circumstances. In either case, and provided the negligence rule is appropriately designed, the standard prediction is that perfectly enforced liability rules will yield socially efficient decisions in the sense of maximizing overall welfare. Conversely, when legal liability is nonexistent or is imperfectly enforced, for instance when tortfeasors are seldom detected, the standard prediction is that socially inefficient behavior will be under-deterred.====There are reasons to question these predictions. A voluminous literature in behavioral economics shows that individuals are not purely motivated by their material self-interest, e.g., they may also be concerned by others’ wellbeing or may be motivated by reciprocity or self-image considerations. On the one hand, the existence of other-oriented motives is likely to decrease opportunistic and socially inefficient behavior, and might therefore usefully complement poorly enforced liability rules. On the other hand, such motives may also generate inefficiencies by driving out self-interested but socially efficient behavior, i.e., they could lead to ==== of actions causing harm to others. In addition, the literature has showed that material sanctions may crowd in or crowd out informal motivations. Should crowding out occur, the efficiency gains of formal liability rules would be smaller when enforcement costs are taken into account.====We investigate how individuals react to liability rules under different settings. Our objective is threefold. First, we aim at evaluating the effect of introducing liability rules: Do theoretically equivalent canonical liability rules achieve similar levels of efficiency? Are they able to perform better than the benchmark scenario without legal rules, even when the rules are poorly enforced and are in principle nondeterrent? Second, we seek to understand to which extent liability rules are able to influence individual behavior beyond the changes in material incentives they generate: Do deviations in behavior from the no-law scenario result solely from payoff relevant deterrence effects? Do liability rules crowd in or crowd out concerns for the group? Third, we investigate how behavior regulated by liability rules is perceived by individuals. Do individuals express disapproval of individuals who cause harm to others? Does it matter if causing harm was socially efficient? Or do individuals mostly express disapproval of those who violated standards established by the liability rules? Does the type of rule then matter?====To answer these questions, we develop a ==== that shares with Public Good experiments the property that each participant's final payoff depends on what other participants do. Individuals repeatedly interact in a Stranger Matching protocol and are both potential tortfeasors and victims. This replicates many real-life situations where individuals can both cause harm and suffer harm caused by others, e.g., one may be both a driver and a pedestrian, each tenant in an apartment building may impose nuisances on others, each worker in a plant may put others at risk. As in many everyday situation, negative externalities can result from either socially inefficient or socially efficient actions, depending on the private circumstances of each individual. Ex ante, our participants face the same probability distribution of circumstances. Ex post, however, when actions must be chosen, participants will be in different circumstances and will not know the circumstances of others. Typically, in our experiment, socially efficient behavior leads to unequal payoffs. Participants also have the possibility to express disapproval of other group members at the end of each period after the realization of payoffs. Sanctions can be either symbolic (non-monetary punishment) or involve small costs to both parties (monetary punishment).====We introduce treatment variations with respect to the legal rules and the enforcement policy. We compare the cases where behavior is regulated by standard liability rules (i.e., strict liability or the negligence rule) to a benchmark without legal rules (====). In addition, we vary the degree of enforcement of the liability rules and consider the cases where they are either perfectly enforced (====) or enforced only with probability one half (====).====Our results first show that both the strict and negligence liability regimes achieve a substantially higher level of efficiency than the no-law benchmark scenario. This holds both when liability rules are perfectly or imperfectly enforced. When rules are perfectly enforced, we confirm the theoretical prediction that both the negligence rule and strict liability achieve the same level of efficiency. However, when the legal rules are imperfectly enforced, one of the two liability rules appears to do better in deterring socially inefficient harm-causing actions. Strict liability outperforms the negligence rule in this respect. On the other hand, strict liability also appears to over-deter socially efficient harm-causing actions, a feature that does not arise under the negligence rule. Second, we show that liability rules affect individual behavior beyond the associated material deterrence effects. In our setting, social preferences in the form of inequality aversion cannot explain socially efficient behavior in the No Law or Mild Law treatments, but motivations such as altruism and efficiency concerns can play a role. When we decompose individual utilities into self-interested and efficiency-oriented components, we observe larger weights on efficiency concerns under either liability rules than in the No Law benchmark. This suggests that liability rules crowd in concerns for others’ well-being. Third, we find that participants mainly disapprove of or sanction players who caused harm, irrespective of the prevailing legal rule or of whether the harmful action is socially efficient.====In the standard approach of Law and Economics, legal liability for harm amounts to the price put on harmful behavior. However, there are clearly other dimensions, in addition to the threat of legal sanctions. Legal liability increases the salience of harmful actions by categorizing them as actions that trigger a right to compensation, perhaps only in some circumstances. When harmful actions would otherwise arise anonymously, legal liability also make these actions attributable, which allow informal sanctions to come at play. Although liability rules do not prohibit any particular actions, they may also convey the message that some actions are not right, at least in some circumstances, which may influence behavior by itself, a moral suasion or normative effect. Legal liability may also affect expectations of how others will behave, which in turn influences behavior when preferences are other-regarding.

We show that a quorum creates an incentive for coalition formation of shareholders supporting the resolution. It works as a coordination device for possibly small shareholders allied in a winning voting coalition. It also generates an equilibrium in which the resolution is not adopted due to lack of quorum. The shareholder structure is central to the determination of the outcome of the vote. A resolution supported by the dominant shareholder is always adopted if his ownership reaches the quorum. However, allied blockholders can successfully approve a resolution opposed by the dominant owner. As a consequence, it is more effective for an active shareholder to propose and pass a resolution than to oppose a board resolution. Finally, we find that the dominant shareholder de facto controls the meeting when his share by far exceeds the second largest share.","Recent years have seen regulatory developments aiming at empowering shareholders in annual meetings.==== Although this objective is advocated by many practitioners and academics (e.g., Bebchuk, 2005), the value of shareholder democracy is regularly questioned. Shareholders are heterogeneous. When turnout is low, the outcome of the vote possibly contradicts the majority view. High participation supposedly increases legitimacy of the vote, particularly when owners disagree. To increase turnout, a minimum quorum is generally required for all or some decisions.====In this paper, we show that requiring a quorum rule affects the voting behavior of owners and impacts the outcome of annual meetings. Anticipating that their vote is necessary to reach the quorum and pass a resolution, shareholders who would otherwise withhold decide to vote: a minimum quorum works as a coordination device for shareholders allied in a winning coalition. A minimum quorum also generates an equilibrium in which shareholders strategically do not vote when they expect the quorum will not be reached: the resolution is not adopted due to the lack of a quorum.====Moreover, our model implies that a resolution supported by the largest (or dominant) shareholder is always adopted if his ownership reaches the quorum. In all other cases, allied shareholders can successfully approve a resolution opposed by the dominant owner. Our results suggest that it is easier for an active blockholder to propose and pass a resolution than to oppose a board resolution. Shareholder proposals are therefore an important component of corporate governance. More generally, we contribute to a better understanding of the power exercised by significant shareholders in meetings. Defining control as the power to pass and to block any resolution, we find that the dominant shareholder controls the meeting when his stake reaches the quorum and significantly exceeds the ownership of the second largest shareholder. Such a controlling interest may represent much less than 50% of the voting stock: we provide an operational interpretation of the notion of de facto control.====Two lines of literature are directly related to this research: the analysis of quorum rules, and voting in shareholder meetings.====A few articles analyze the consequences of the introduction of quorums on voter behavior, turnout and the outcome of the vote in referenda. Herrera and Mattozzi (2010) and Aguiar-Conraria and Magalhães (2010) find that the equilibrium expected turnout may actually be lower with a participation quorum. Most models in the political science literature consider many voters, with one vote each. Ritzberger (2005) analyzes strategic voting in annual meetings when stockholders with different shares disagree on a resolution. He concludes that an equilibrium exists if and only if the largest shareholder supports the resolution. Cvijanovic et al. (2017) analyze participation in a model where a group of ”regular voters” always vote while the second group consists of a very large number of identical ”discretionary voters” who choose to vote strategically. They show that similar preferences accross groups lower the participation rate. As in Ritzberger (2005), we consider several strategic owners with different shares and analyze their power. By adding a minimum quorum, our results differ substantially.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and details shareholders’ equilibrium strategies.

Leniency also provides an incentive for citizens to cooperate with law enforcement. When the police discover a crime, a guilty citizen decides whether to share any information. If such cooperation ever reveals a secondary crime, a citizen only shares information if the police sometimes reduce penalties for the initial crime. Thus, when citizens are multiply active in crime, discretion is a further tool for deterrence. Generous discounts induce universal cooperation, and the possibility of being caught for a secondary crime reduces the incentive to invest in every crime.","Rules ordinarily admit discretion in their enforcement. Arbiters decide whether and how they should be applied based on the facts at hand. When rules cannot be tailored to all eventualities, such flexibility can be useful. Of course, the downside of vesting power in an arbiter is the risk of its abuse. An optimal policy should allow for discretion until the marginal flexibility benefit no longer outweighs the marginal cost of potential abuse (Shavell, 2007).====Although the economic intuition is clear, optimal discretion is difficult to identify when stakes are high—vital flexibility can risk serious abuse. The criminal justice system is a case in point. Flexibility is vital because every offense is different. Crimes identical in name can differ in fact. On the other hand, discretion can be seriously abused by law enforcement, who, at times, might be corrupt, biased, or incompetent.====Discretion permeates the justice system, but it starts with the police (Schulhofer, 1988). In every police department, officers decide which laws to enforce and how strictly to enforce them. Increasingly, those decisions are subject to media scrutiny (Williams, 2015). A growing body of literature is now asking whether police discretion is appropriate (Mastrofski, 2004). Can we trust the police to make good decisions? A negative answer means the police are either too strict or too lenient with at least a portion of the population. This article explores the former possibility. Specifically, a simple model belies the intuition that leniency reduces deterrence. If the police wisely use their discretion to be lenient, they can stop more crime with less effort.====Economic models originally viewed crime as a binary decision (Becker, 1968). A rational citizen would only commit a crime if it provided an increase in utility over following the law. In the binary setting, whatever makes a crime relatively more attractive makes it more likely to occur. One example is the possibility of lenient treatment from authorities. However, crime is often less of a binary decision than a matter of investment (Mookherjee and Png, 1994). The question is not whether a factory will pollute but how much it will pollute. Or think of a citizen deciding how much to speed in a vehicle, or how severely to assault a patron of a bar. In these settings, leniency is no longer in opposition to deterrence.====Consider first a citizen investing in a single crime. There is always a risk she will be caught. If the police do catch her, they decide whether to treat the offense with leniency (for realism, assume sanctions are not so extreme as to deter all crime). For example, they could book her for a lesser offense or simply let her go. When leniency falls with criminal investment, the police increase deterrence by reducing the marginal incentive to invest in crime. A falling discount is like a rising penalty, an already familiar device in the marginal deterrence literature (Shavell, 1992). Falling discounts are also easy to justify in practice because serious offenses are more difficult to forgive than minor ones. Thus, police discretion promotes deterrence under a mild assumption.====If a citizen invests in two types of crime, discretion becomes even more useful. For one, it would be infeasible to set a formal penalty scheme to address every possible combination of multiple crimes, and discretion might offer a workable alternative. Additionally, the police can use discretion to play two crimes off each other, which raises deterrence for both at the same time.====Presumably, police are softer on a citizen who cooperates. By explaining herself under questioning, and by complying with requests, such as permission to search her personal property, a citizen may persuade the police to treat her with leniency. However, she also runs the risk of revealing another crime if she has committed one. That risk is non-trivial. The scope of criminal law continues to expand dramatically in the United States (Luna, 2005, Husak, 2009). As an illustration, the number of criminal offenses in the United States Code grew from roughly 3000 in 1980 to nearly 4500 in 2007 (Baker, 2008). Even the average white collar professional commits an estimated three felonies daily (Silverglate, 2011). Some experts go as far as to argue no citizen should ever, under any circumstance, speak to the police without a lawyer present because the risk of accidental incrimination is too high (Duane, 2016).====Whether or not the scope of criminal law is optimal, the reality of multiple criminal activity provides an important tool for police. Perhaps surprisingly, police can use a simple strategy to further increase deterrence for multiple crimes simultaneously. To build an intuition, first note a citizen has no reason to cooperate unless the police are sometimes lenient, so assume the police do offer big enough penalty discounts to induce cooperation. Suppose one of two committed crimes is detected. If a cooperative citizen is caught, she might then draw a penalty reduction for the first crime, but she risks incrimination of a second. For a concrete example, take the crimes of theft and illegal drug possession. For each, a citizen decides how much to invest. The former investment rises with the quantity of stolen goods (or their value), and the latter rises with the quantity of an illegal drug.====Compared to a regime of no discretion, i.e., where the police are never lenient, a marginal increase in theft has an additional two effects. When cooperation is optimal, a citizen knows she is more likely to be caught for theft after being caught for drug possession. The incentive to invest in theft is thus reduced. Next, penalty discounts for cooperation depend on criminal investment. As in the case of a single crime, a falling discount lowers the optimal investment in theft. Because identical reasoning applies to drug possession, deterrence for both crimes rises simultaneously.====The result here is related to but distinct from self-reporting of behavior in Kaplow and Shavell (1994), who show that permitting criminals to turn themselves in for the certainty equivalent of an expected penalty can save on the cost of law enforcement without affecting deterrence (see also Innes, 2000, Innes, 2001, Gerlach, 2013). Here individuals make a decision over criminal investment in multiple crimes rather than a binary decision over a single crime, and the advantage of leniency is through deterrence instead of the resources saved on offenders who turn themselves in. The result also provides a counterpoint to Piccolo and Immordino (2016), who arrive at the opposite conclusion in a group setting (see also, e.g., Miller, 2009, Bigoni et al., 2012). While leniency may erode deterrence in the group context of whistleblowers, it may instead promote deterrence for individuals who engage in solitary crime.====Beyond its role as a deterrent, discretion is desirable for law enforcement because it expands their choice set (see Mastrofski, 2004). Interestingly, the model shows it can also make citizens happier. Citizens always benefit from leniency, and the choice of whether to cooperate expands their own choice set. Discretion therefore has the remarkable potential to reduce crime, make police happier, make citizens happier, and save on the social cost of law enforcement. Furthermore, discretion is a feature of the justice system because the law cannot plan for every contingency. Some crimes are rightfully forgiven.====On the other hand, discretion can be used to coerce favors and bribes from citizens if legal oversight is weak (Gamba et al., 2018). Critics also worry discretion can be used to create unfair racial disparities in law enforcement, and a number of studies address the possibility (e.g., Knowles et al., 2001, Dharmapala and Ross, 2004, Anwar and Fang, 2006, Gelman et al., 2007, Tomic and Hakes, 2008, Coviello and Persico, 2015, Goel et al., 2016, Fryer, 2016, Lehrer and Lepage, 2019). While racial and other biases are a reality of the justice system, the focus here is on the more basic question of whether any leniency permitted by discretion erodes deterrence. For that reason, the model takes a non-Beckerian world as reality, in which sanctions are not high enough to deter all crime. The question is therefore not how a social planner would design law enforcement, but rather how leniency can beneficially operate in an imperfect law enforcement regime.====On a final point, enforcing the law is costly for police. If agency problems are a concern, discretion may provide an extra benefit. Unless discretion reduces deterrence, crime is less responsive to police effort in a discretionary regime, and shirking by officers will have a smaller impact on crime. Also, if discretion does reduce deterrence, there is no good prediction of whether it will lower or raise agency costs.====The rest of this article is outlined as follows. The following section presents the model, which is applied to single and multiple crimes in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 discusses the interaction of discretion with police effort.

Recently, in a series of papers, ==== and ====,==== efficiency, symmetry, dummy, feasibility and fairness.","Harms are often caused by more than one injurer. Examples abound. Several factories emit toxical chemicals, causing water and ground pollution. Firms may engage in price-fixing collusion to extract consumers’ surpluses. A person may be injured by a product manufactured unsafely by the contractor itself or its subcontractor. Traffic accidents commonly occur by multiple vehicle collisions.====If multiple parties or factors are involved in an accident, it may be difficult to determine causation. A well-known example is the case of Summers v. Tice that involves a plaintiff who was injured by one of two hunters shooting in their direction. In this case, it is simultaneity of the actions by two parties that makes it troublesome to determine causation, although one of them surely caused the accident. However, if there are other (random) factors that may have contributed to the accident, it becomes even more intricate to determine causation.====Once causation is established and so each of the defendants is found to be liable for the plaintiff's total harm, the defendants are called to be jointly and severally liable. Under the rule of joint and several liability, the plaintiff is allowed to recover the full amount of damages from any defendant, regardless of the particular injurer's share of the liability. The rule of joint and several liability is applied when either defendants acted jointly or the plaintiff's harm is indivisible. Depending on the apportionment rules, however, defendants may or may not take an action for contribution from the other defendants. Under the rule of no contribution, no one who paid more than their equitable share has the right to obtain any reimbursement from other defendants. On the other hand, under the rule of contribution, a defendant who paid more may obtain contribution from the other defendants. At common law, there was no right to contribution, but the contribution rule has been gradually replacing the no contribution rule from concerns that the no contribution rule may cause a serious consequence against the social justice. Recently, various statutes have explicitly provided for the contribution rule, and this trend creates a momentum for closely examining how to apportion the damage amount among several joint tortfeasors.====Most literature on joint tortfeasors has focused on providing a rationale for the joint and several liability rule from the aspect of (dynamic) efficiency,==== i.e., whether it gives potential defendants a right incentive to take the efficient level of care.==== This paper, aside from the efficiency issue, mainly addresses the issue of (static) fairness, what is a fair way to apportion damages, given that care levels are already taken and the resulting damage amount is determined. The literature on this line is relatively scant. To the best of our knowledge, Ben-Shahar, 1996, Ben-Shahar, 2000 was the first to consider this issue by introducing the cooperative game theory approach. Later, Braham (2009) used the concept of power indices. Recently, in a series of papers, Dehez and Ferey (2013) and Ferey and Dehez (2016a,b) showed that the Shapley value and the weighted Shapley value can be usefully applied to solving the problem of sharing joint liability among defendants especially in the case of sequential acts.====Following the line of the literature, we take a cooperative game theory approach. In case that an indivisible value or a cost is generated jointly by a group of players, many solution concepts (allocation rules) have been proposed. The Shapley value is one of the most widely used allocation rules which ensures static efficiency.==== In fact, it is proved that the Shapley value is the unique allocation rule satisfying static efficiency, symmetry, dummy and additivity.====In determining the apportionment of damages among multiple defendants, the Shapley value may appear to be fair in the sense that it satisfies symmetry requiring that if two players contribute the same to any coalition, their share should be the same. In this paper, however, we argue that it is not strictly fair in the following sense. Suppose that an accident may occur only if the total sum of the defendant's negligence meets the threshold of 10. If the negligence of one defendant is 9 and the other's negligence is 1, each defendant should be liable for one half of the total damage, because neither could have caused the accident alone.==== Considering the feature that they would be equally liable even if the first defendant was much more negligent, one could hardly say that the Shapley value allocation is fair in this case. This problem occurs in cooperative games with a threshold level, i.e., a game in which a surplus or a cost occurs only if the sum of individual contributions in a coalition exceeds a certain threshold level.====To correct the problem, we add two ingredients explicitly into the structure of the conventional cooperative game; negligence and uncertainty. First, we consider the negligence of each individual explicitly, while it was only implicitly considered in Dehez and Ferey (2013). Second, accidents usually do not occur deterministically but probabilistically. A particular action of tortfeasors may or may not incur damages. Therefore, uncertainty is, in nature, inherent in tort cases but most of the literature using a cooperative game theory approach has assumed it away mainly for simplicity. Based on this, we consider a stochastic cooperative game with a threshold level. In the example described above, the threshold level of 10 units is not absolute in reality. It may be affected by random events. It could be either less than 10 or greater than 10 probabilistically. Also, the actual negligence may differ from the observed negligence due to observation or measurement errors. With those random factors, either defendant may be solely liable for the damage. If one takes unpredictable events (which always exist in reality) into account, the first defendant should pay a larger amount of compensation than the second defendant, because the probability that he is solely liable is higher.====In this paper, therefore, we propose a new allocation rule, what we call stochastic Shapley value. Roughly speaking, it is to apportion damage among defendants by their expected marginal contribution computed with respect to the conditional probability given that the accident has occurred. This concept can be applied to a class of stochastic cooperative games with a threshold value, which is quite vast. Consider, for example, a variation of the pollution case that was introduced in Ferey and Dehez (2016a). Two firms negligently pour toxic chemicals to a pond. Assume that there exists a threshold of 50 units above which chemicals are lethal for fish in the pond. Assume that firm ==== and firm ==== poured 40 units and 10 units respectively. The prediction by the Shapley value is that the two firms share the damage equally, even though firm ==== was more negligent. In this case, the court should take relative negligence seriously and this is consistent with the prediction by the stochastic Shapley value. The famous case of Paul's car is similar.==== Consider its slight variation. Suppose that ==== and ==== negligently lean on Paul's car parked at a scenic lookout of the top of a mountain. If it requires a certain threshold level of force, say 10 units, to push the car past the curbstone, and ==== and ==== pushed the car by the force of 7 units and 3 units respectively in the same direction, it is fair that ==== is more liable than ==== contrary to the Shapley value allocation. These examples suggest that the Shapley value does not reflect enough information about degrees of relative negligence. None of the papers take account of relative negligence explicitly in determining the apportionment rule. This paper addresses the issue of how the degree of fault of each defendant can affect the sharing rule when the probability of an accident depends on the negligence of each individual.====The stochastic Shapley value is to extend the concept of Shapley value to a stochastic setting in which the value is stochastically determined. There are other allocation rules that extend the Shapley value to a stochastic situation. For example, Charnes and Granot (1973) proposed the concept of the prior Shapley value.==== But it is an ==== concept.==== If it is defined in ==== terms, it cannot satisfy ==== efficiency, although it may satisfy ==== efficiency. Then, it cannot be used as a proper rule of apportioning damages, because the sum of compensations may not cover the total amount of the damage that is actually incurred. The allocation based on the stochastic Shapley value is, however, ==== efficient and moreover feasible in the sense that each share is always nonnegative. It also satisfies fairness requiring that a more negligent defendant is more liable for the resulting damage.==== Finally, we show that it converges to the Shapley value as the variances of random terms go to zero if the negligence of each defendant would be necessary for the accident in a deterministic sense (i.e., without any uncertainty).====Our result that the damage should be apportioned not equally to each defendant but based on their relative causal contributions to the plaintiff's injury, corresponds with actual court decisions. In the case of Moore v. Johns-Mansville Sales Corp (asbestos case), the Texas court rejected the contention that the defendants should bear the liability pro rata,==== thereby apportioning liability among defendants based upon their relative roles in causing the injuries. The case of Parker v. Bell Asbestos Mines, Ltd. is another example. In the case, the plaintiff sued for her husband's death from lung cancer. Her deceased husband, however, had been a heavy smoker for many years, so his death was due to asbestos exposure or smoking. The jury found that smoking contributed sixty percent, and inhaling asbestos forty percent, to his lung cancer. Accordingly, the court reduced total damages from $214,000 to $85,600 to reflect the percent of causation attributable to asbestos exposure. This may serve as evidence that the stochastic Shapley value can be used in apportioning damages to each defendant to reflect their expected marginal contributions.====The possibility that random factors can have a real effect on an injury occurrence complicates the determination of causation as well as apportioning liability. As in the case of Summers v. Tice, the but-for test can be ineffective. In fact, the but-for test provides a too weak causation criterion, because passing the test is just a necessary condition for the occurrence of the injury and so it may include some necessary but remote causes. In other cases, which are often called overdetermined causation cases, each of multiple factors would have been sufficient to produce the injury, but none of them was necessary for the injury. However, the requirement that each factor should have been sufficient by itself seems too restrictive. So, Hart and Honoré (1959) and later Wright (1985) proposed an alternative causation criterion, so-called NESS (Necessary Element of a Sufficient Set), in overdetermined cases. Under this criterion, an act is a cause of an injury if and only if it is a necessary element of a set of antecedent actual conditions that is sufficient for the occurrence of the injury. All of these criteria could be clearly applied to deterministic cases, but once some stochastic element can be a factor to the consequence, it becomes obscure whether a particular act is necessary or sufficient to the consequence. For example, in the modified case of Paul's car with two defendants, suppose the threshold level of force is 10 units, and ==== and ==== push the car with the force of 5 units respectively in the same direction. Then, neither of the negligence is sufficient to the consequence but both are necessary for it. However, if wind might be blowing possibly from the opposite direction, neither may be necessary. Or, if ==== and ==== push the car with the force of 12 units respectively simultaneously in the same direction, both are sufficient but neither is necessary. In this case, however, if a wind force comes into consideration, neither may be sufficient.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we illustrate the problem of the Shapley value in a simple deterministic model. In Section 3, we introduce the stochastic Shapley value in a general stochastic model. Section 4 contains some discussions on its applicability and concluding remarks.

In a pioneering work ====, Schubert (1965) examined the ideologies of Supreme Court justices from the end of the Roosevelt era to the onset of the Johnson administration and found that two primary dimensions, i.e. the political and economic liberalism, can broadly capture the ideology of justices. For adequate measurement of judicial ideology, the use of sophisticated quantitative techniques to estimate the judicial ideology empirically has become widespread (Fischman and Law, 2009). For instance, Segal and Cover (1989) exploit the variation in the newspaper editorials preceding the appointment of judges to estimate the ideological scores for the Supreme Court justices. Epstein et al. (1998) describe the behavioral patterns of the 16 justices that sat on U.S Supreme Court for 10 years or more between 1937 and 1993, and find significant changes over time. On the other hand, Bailey (2007) exploits Supreme Court decisions reviewing Congressional actions to estimate the judicial ideology on the same scale as Congressional representatives and Presidents. More recently, Yung (2010) uses the frequency of voting with Democratic and Republican appointees to estimate the ideology of circuit court judges while Bonica et al. (2016) exploit judge’s political donations to derive the estimates judicial ideology known as Campaign Finance Scores. Furthermore, Epstein et al. (2007a) employ various ideological measures of the judge’s appointing President and examine whether the President and home-state Senator are of the same party as the senior Senator to estimate judicial ideology with Judicial Common Space Scores, placing the justices of lower courts and justices of higher courts in the same policy space (Epstein et al., 2007b). Most recently, Bonica et al. (2016, 2017) exploit the agency relationship between judges and their law clerks to estimate a judge’s ideology from the ideology of his or her clerks. Their scores are widely known as Clerk-Based Ideology scores.====Previous approaches to dynamic estimation of judicial ideal points followed the original work by Schubert (1965). For example, scholars have identified several dimensions where the ideological views of justices can be identified. In this respect, Rhode and Spaeth (1976) identified three dimensions of Warren Court and Burger Court such as freedom, equality and New Dealism. Additional dimensions of judicial preferences include newspaper editorials at the time of the appointment (Segal and Cover, 1989), the percentage of liberal votes in a single policy area (Epstein et al., 1998), background characteristics of judges (Tate and Handberg, 1991), and structural model of voting and preference estimation (Poole and Rosenthal, 1997; Clinton et al., 2004; Jackman, 2001). To investigate whether the judicial ideal points change over time, Epstein et al. (1998) adjust the percentage of justice’s votes in the liberal direction on civil liberties-related issues in each term. Specifically, they employ Baum (1988) adjustment criteria by subtracting the median difference below the justice in the past and current term from the scores of all justices.====Estimating the judicial ideology has been extended substantially. For instance, Windett et al. (2015) combined the Campaign Finance (CF) scores with the item response estimates of judicial voting behavior in all 52 state courts of last resort for the period 1995–2010 (Bonica and Woodruff, 2014; Bonica, 2013, 2014). Bonica and Sen (2017) extend the scaling used in Bonica (2014) to jointly scale the U.S federal judiciary and legal profession in a common space with other political actors, and compose the ideological scores across all tiers of the federal judiciary and the legal profession. Moreover, Clark (2009) utilizes an axiomatic measure of the ideological polarization developed by Esteban and Ray (1999) to examine the patterns of ideological heterogeneity over time, and finds evidence of substantial ideological polarization. More recently, Bonica (2018) uses a generalized version====The most commonly used estimates of judicial ideology for U.S. Supreme Court justices are known as Martin-Quinn scores. In their seminal work, Martin and Quinn (2002, 2007) employ Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to fit a Bayesian measurement model of ideal points for all justices serving on U.S Supreme Court for the period 1953–1999 to examine the extent to which the ideal points of justices change throughout their tenure on the court. To this end, they posit a dynamic item response (IR) model with ==== specified evolutionary variances to allow for ideal points to change over time. To examine whether the estimated ideal points change over time, they specify prior distributions of variance on justice’s behavior to explicitly model the temporal dependence for the latent ideal points and use Gibbs sampling theory, and a dynamic linear model. More specifically, Martin and Quinn (2002) leverage votes on cases to generate dynamic ideological justice-level estimates using dynamic Bayesian item response theory. These scores have been extended along a number of dimensions, which include the estimates that vary according to the issue area (Clark and Lauderdale, 2010), or estimates relying on opinion texts (Lauderdale and Clark, 2014). Because Martin and Quinn (2002) (M-Q) scores show ideological movement over a judge’s tenure, and Epstein et al. (2007b) show systematic ideological drift, the dynamic nature of M-Q scores received much scholarly attention. The method to generate M-Q scores has been used to estimate the judicial ideology in other countries such as United Kingdom (Hanretty, 2013), Belgium (Dalla Pellegrina et al., 2017a), Portugal and Spain (Hanretty, 2012; Garoupa et al., 2013; Dalla Pellegrina et al., 2017b), Argentina (Bertomeu et al., 2017), Brazil (Ferreira and Mueller, 2014), Philippines (Dalla Pellegrina et al., 2014), Taiwan (Dalla Pellegrina et al., 2012), and Turkey (Varol et al., 2017) among several others.====In this paper, we set to replicate M-Q scores with alternative voting measures and estimation strategies. In particular, Martin and Quinn (2002) select all non-unanimous cases that are either formally decided cases with written opinions after full oral argument or cases decided by an equally divided vote. Using the disposition variable in the Supreme Court Data Base (Spaeth et al., 2018), they code affirmances and reversals with a binary variable. In his critique of M-Q scores, Farnsworth (2007) notes that this method keeps track of whether a justice voted to affirm or reverse in a case but does not say anything about the ideological leaning of the justices vote. Our replication strategy consists of three steps. In the first step, we construct a more parsimonious justice vote measure to accommodate the ideological leaning of the vote into the liberal-conservative direction. In doing so, we manually code the liberal and conservative reversals on case-by-case level by applying the same case selection criteria as Martin and Quinn (2002). The proposed voting on liberal-conservative axis does not necessitate any prior distribution of evolutionary variances on justice-level ideological behavior. Second, with the proposed voting measure, our goal is to replicate constant and dynamic M-Q scores using an ordered probit estimation approach and MCMC Gibbs large-sample methods. To allow for judicial ideology to trend smoothly over time without imposing prior restrictions on justices’ behavior, we set the justice-level sample size at 1,000,000 observations which yields roughly 1.9 billion iterations of the baseline ideal point estimates. In doing so, we decompose the judicial ideology throughout the tenure into the structural and cyclical component, which allows us to parse out the long-run ideological component from its short-run counterpart. In this respect, we compose a filtering parameter proposed by Ravn and Uhlig (2002) to separate the long-run ideological trend from its cyclical component. Furthermore, we extend the time span of Martin and Quinn (2002) from 1948 to 1999 period to 1793–2016 using ==== (Spaeth et al., 2018), to examine the entire population of justices at U.S Supreme Court. And third, our goal is to replicate M-Q scores for each justice by policy area to better understand the heterogeneity of the judicial ideology across different areas, which might help us better understand the sources of justices’ policy preferences.====We add to the existing body of literature by providing a relatively novel empirical specification to facilitate the replication of the judicial ideology scores using a Gibbs sampling scheme and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation route. Our approach allows the scholars to refine the underlying latent judicial preferences with the direction-based outcome variable in contrast to a binary coding of reversals or affirmances. To this end, we refine the construction of dynamic ideal points by introducing a smoothing parameter that allows for the separation of long-run judicial traits from the short-run, mean-reverting cyclical component. One caveat to keep in mind is that our contribution does not overhaul the existing estimation techniques and databases used to build constant and dynamic ideal points of judicial behavior. Instead, it introduces a replication strategy that is better able to detect the ideological direction of the judicial behavior compared to binary coded voting variable where such inference is much more difficult. Additionally, the proposed strategy can further remove the noise from the series that capture judicial ideology both cross-sectionally and intertemporally.====Although Spaeth database has been challenged in the literature (Shapiro, 2008), the primary challenges posited by the dataset involve the coding for variables related to issue areas and legal provision. Our key interest lies in whether the justices affirmed or reversed the case and in which ideological direction the reversal or affirmance is directed. In our view, the combination of ideological leaning and case disposition variable posits many fewer issues for the interpretation of results than the variables related to issue areas and legal provision.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the replication strategy. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 discusses the replicated constant and dynamic ideal points and compares them against M-Q estimates.

In light of the foregoing, one would expect minority attorneys to regret their decisions to attend law school and become lawyers. Yet, empirical research indicates that minority attorneys are predominately satisfied with their decision to become attorneys and that their satisfaction is on par with that of white attorneys. How to account for this seeming paradox?====. Moreover, they are especially satisfied in nominally low status solo practitioner positions. This article concludes by advancing possible explanations for these differences.","Racial minorities are largely absent from foundational studies of the American legal profession (Heinz and Laumann, 1982: 6; Smigel, 1964: 45). Only as institutionalized discrimination receded in recent decades have minorities joined the “lawyer governing class” in greater numbers and become a major subject of inquiry (Pearce, 2001: 381).====A substantial body of research now documents the challenges faced by minority attorneys. Racial minorities are underrepresented in law schools and are at increased risk of failing the bar exam (Clydesdale, 2014:752-53; Wald, 2011:1108). They also constitute a small percentage of practicing lawyers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 4.4% of attorneys are Black and 5.6% are Hispanic.==== Integration remains elusive, with minorities less likely to work in corporate law firms and more likely to work in government and in smaller firms (Gorman and Kay, 2010: 222; Johnson, 1997:1037-38; Sommerlad, 2011: 2487). Minority attorneys who are employed by corporate firms struggle to locate mentors, receive lower quality work assignments, and disproportionately depart without making partner (Payne-Pikus et al., 2010: 559-60; Sander, 2006: 1759; Woodson, 2016: 111).====Whatever their settings, minorities face subtle and not-so-subtle discrimination such as being mistaken for, ====, court reporters, secretaries, and even criminal defendants (Collins et al., 2017: 1642; Cruz and Molina, 2009: 1010-11). They also earn less than white attorneys; some studies suggest tens of thousands of dollars a year less (Dau-Schmidt and Mukhopadhaya, 1999:358-59; McIntyre and Simkovic, 2017: 2, 9; Stake et al., 2007; 962-63).====In light of the forgoing, one would expect minority attorneys to be dissatisfied with their decisions to become attorneys or, at minimum, to be less satisfied than their white counterparts. Yet, several empirical studies, mostly focusing on Black attorneys, have observed that minority attorneys’ satisfaction is equivalent to that of white attorneys (Dau-Schmidt and Mukhopadhaya, 1999:362-63; Lempert et al., 2000: 445-47). The nationally representative ==== (“AJD”) suggests that Black and Hispanic attorneys are among the most satisfied attorneys: In ====’s second wave, 80% of these attorneys indicated that they were at least moderately satisfied with their decisions to become attorneys (Dinovitzer et al., 2009a,b). Moreover, racial minorities’ satisfaction in the legal profession cannot be reduced to their tendency to work in more satisfying legal practice settings (Lempert et al., 2000: 446-47). How to reconcile the challenges faced by minority attorneys in a white-dominated legal profession with their high levels of satisfaction?====This is the first study to address and assess empirically this paradox of minority satisfaction. Using a sample that consists of substantial numbers of white, Hispanic, and Black attorneys, we also seek to ascertain whether the drivers of satisfaction differ based on race. In particular, we theorize that minority attorneys’ satisfaction is not predicated on the attainment of prestige markers such as high incomes and partnership in prestigious law firms that have been the principal focus of legal profession researchers. Rather, racial minorities are able to derive high levels of satisfaction from membership in the legal profession by forming professional identities that are not fully “bleached out” (Levinson, 1993:1578; Wilkins, 1998: 1504).====We begin by reviewing the research on satisfaction in the legal profession, focusing particularly on explanations of racial differences in satisfaction. We then describe the survey data and the incorporated measures that provide evidence of a paradox of minority attorney satisfaction among minority attorneys in Texas. We then test our theory that the paradox can be attributed to the different drivers of white and minority attorneys’ satisfaction. We conclude by suggesting that white and minority attorneys may manifest different value systems and identify potential sources of these differences.",The paradox of minority attorney satisfaction,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819301632,27 September 2019,2019,Research Article,174.0

However, lawyers are expensive to hire. Defendants prosecuted by courts surely hope that legal representation by lawyer is worth the expense. This study empirically explores this trade-off by estimating the effect of legal representation on various court decisions surrounding the prosecution of individuals in environmental criminal cases in Flanders (Belgium) between 2003 and 2006. Our results apparently reveal that the presence of a lawyer meaningfully lowers the likelihoods of courts convicting a defendant and imposing monetary ==== and prison sentences on defendants and reduces the magnitudes of monetary sanctions and prison terms. However, these benefits may not outweigh the costs of hiring a lawyer. Consequently, our results do not unequivocally demonstrate the prudence of securing legal presentation in court. Instead, conclusions depend on the benefits associated with reduced prison terms and the expected number of hours billed by the hired lawyer.","Yearly, millions of people must appear before a variety of courts. For instance, 1.62 million defendants were prosecuted in criminal cases in the UK magistrates’ courts in 2011 (Ministry of Justice, 2012). Given the serious consequences of prosecution, it seems prudent to secure a lawyer since lawyers (should) have superior knowledge of legal text and experience with court proceedings. However, courts generally do not provide lawyers; worse yet, lawyers are expensive to hire. Given this expense, we can wonder whether lawyers are worth their price by helping to shape the outcomes of court trials.====The vast majority of past empirical research studying the effect of legal representation on case outcomes focuses on common law countries, with the largest proportion using US data [see Sandefur (2010) and Greiner and Pattanayak (2012) for overviews] and only a limited fraction using UK data (e.g., Genn and Genn, 1989; Latreille et al., 2005; Pleasence and Balmer, 2007). Studies set in a civil law country are extremely scarce, with the notable exceptional studies of Vietnam (Huang, 2008; Huang et al., 2014) and Slovenia (Grajzl et al., 2016). Furthermore, these previous studies cover a wide variety of courts and proceedings, such as juvenile courts (Clarke and Koch, 1980; Feld, 1990), tax courts (Lederman and Hrung, 2006), administrative tribunals (Genn and Genn, 1989; Monsma and Lempert, 1992), housing courts (Seron et al., 2001), constitutional civil rights cases (Schwab and Eisenberg, 1988), civil cases (Huang, 2008) and bail hearings (Colbert et al., 2002). However, to our best knowledge, no previous study analyzes environmental cases. Of the existing studies, most focus on the value of representation in the context of civil and administrative procedures. Surprisingly few studies examine the value of representation in the context of criminal litigation procedures. Overall, research on the value of legal representation is limited. As noted by Monsma and Lempert (1992), the limited number of studies probably stems from researchers’ focus on legal contexts in which legal representation is either so common that defendants must actively work to not use a lawyer or so unusual that it cannot serve as an explanatory factor because no variation exists (Huang, 2008). For example, we cannot consider environmental cases in the US since all defendants hire lawyers.====Our empirical study contributes to this literature in four important ways. As the first contribution, we explore a new type of criminal setting: regulatory law. Previous studies focus on standard crimes, such as burglary, arson, assaults. Our exploration is useful since results based on other criminal settings most likely do not generalize to the regulatory setting. Second, we explore the extensive margin by distinguishing between the presence and absence of counsel in a criminal setting. Prior studies of criminal cases distinguish only between public counsel and private counsel (Clarke and Koch, 1980; Anderson and Heaton, 2012), yet previous studies of the extensive margin focus exclusively on non-criminal proceedings, e.g., divorce, child custody (Greiner and Pattanayak, 2012). Third, we explore the effect of legal representation in a civil law system. Common law and civil law systems differ greatly (Cooter and Ulen, 2013). Thus, the role of lawyers differs substantially. For instance, common law systems depend on precedents; therefore, lawyers can help defendants by finding and citing relevant and helpful previous cases. In contrast, civil law systems do not depend on precedents; consequently, lawyers do not need to identify such cases. Fourth, we compare the benefits and costs of legal representation using a simple design, which still represents a contribution since few studies even attempt a comparison.====To generate these contributions, we examine the benefits and costs of legal representation within a civil law context for criminal procedures on the previously ignored topic of environmental crime. Specifically, we explore the prosecution of environmental criminal offenses committed by individuals in Belgium, in particular, in the region of Flanders. Interestingly, this setting represents a legal context where a sizable portion of defendants do not hire a lawyer since they are not legally required to do so. Of the prosecuted individuals in our sample, some 40% chose not to be represented by a lawyer.==== As our identification strategy, we distinguish between cases with legal representation and cases without representation. As our strategy does not exploit any random assignment of legal counsel or natural experiment, we rely on exogenous variation in legal representation. Of course, the presence of a legal counsel may be endogenously determined, which would bias our estimate either through the selection process of defendants hiring a lawyer or that of lawyers accepting a client; we assess the implications of this possible, if not likely, bias in sub-section 6.4. Given this bias, our estimates may not reflect causal effects.====Our empirical results reveal that the hiring of a lawyer lowers the likelihoods of being found guilty, receiving a fine and monetary sanctions in general, and incarceration. Beyond the likelihood of receiving particular sanctions, the presence of a lawyer also lowers the magnitude of fines and monetary sanctions in general as well as the length of prison terms. However, some portions of sanctions are typically suspended, the remaining portions deemed the effective magnitudes. Given this distinction, we find that hiring a lawyer tends to raise the suspended fine magnitude and, not surprisingly, lower the effective fine magnitude. On the other hand, the hiring of a lawyer lowers the effective prison term, yet does not seem to influence the suspended prison term. Lastly, we compare these benefits of legal representation with the likely costs of representation.====In the following section, we review the relevant literature and highlight the contribution of the current study. Section 3 presents the legal context of the Flanders, while Section 4 describes the dataset. Section 5 presents the econometric framework. Section 6 discusses the estimation results and investigates the trade-off between the benefits and costs of hiring a lawyer using a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation.

In our model, criminals compete against each other in a crime market, but collaborate with other criminals and “dishonest” workers in the attempt to launder their crime proceeds via covert money laundering ties. Our first result shows that in the equilibrium money laundering network, a core group of criminals spreads its total crime proceeds over as many money launderers as available, giving rise to a core-periphery network where the size of the core group depends on the relative profitability of crime versus the outside option wage. We then study the optimal decision of a law enforcement agency that aims to minimize the total criminal activity in this society. We derive an optimal sharing rule that shows how much of a given crime-fighting budget the agency should optimally spend on anti-crime and anti-money laundering policies, respectively. This budget-sharing rule can be quantified empirically using readily available estimates for the expected crime proceeds, outside option wages, and fines in a society. Our predictions for four European countries (Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain) show that the optimal budget share spent on money laundering controls should be about 35%.","In this paper, we present a game-theoretic analysis of social networks in the money laundering process. Our first objective is to develop a tractable model of a society of criminals and money launderers. In the model we propose, agents first choose to either enter the crime market or to pick up a legal job. Those who opt for a criminal career can subsequently form money laundering ties with every other active criminal and every “dishonest” worker, that is, every other agent who dropped out of the crime market. These ties help criminals to launder their anticipated crime proceeds, thereby reducing the probability that criminals are detected and prosecuted for a criminal act. Criminals, finally, determine their actual level of criminal activity, whereby they compete with other criminals for a booty of a fixed size. Our main finding on this game is that it has a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium when the costs of forming money laundering ties, which mainly consist of the risk of being detected and punished as a money launderer, are “not too high”. In this equilibrium, a core-periphery network emerges that connects all active criminals with every other criminal agent in the society. The equilibrium network thus shares some important features with real money laundering organizations in that the network is non-hierarchical and connects different criminals with each other (Kleemans, 2007).====The second objective of our paper is to develop some policy recommendations from this model. Towards this end, we introduce a law enforcement agency into the model whose main objective it is to minimize the total level of criminal activity in the society. Nevertheless, in order to do so, the agency might proceed in two different ways: First, by directly increasing the probability of detecting criminal offenders in flagrante or, second, by making it harder for criminals to launder their crime proceeds, thereby deterring agents from entering the crime market. Our main result is an optimal sharing rule that shows how much of a given crime-fighting budget the agency should optimally spend on the fight against crime and money laundering, respectively (Fig. 1).====To illustrate the use of this rule, we calculate the optimal budget shares for four European countries (Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain). For this purpose, we take guidance from our model and use the fact that the optimal budget shares, as predicted by our model, depend solely on a few “sufficient statistics” (Chetty, 2009), that is, constructs of parameters and variables that have some immediate real-world correspondences. In particular, we show that one needs no more than readily available estimates for gross crime proceeds, the costs of money laundering activities, the expected fines on crime and money laundering felonies, and criminals’ outside option wages in the legal economy to determine the optimal budget shares. Our best estimate for the optimal share to be spent on money laundering controls is about 35% for all the four countries considered. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis shows that this value varies between 20.7% and 47.9% for all reasonable values of the required statistics, suggesting a robust and sizable crime deterrence effect of money laundering controls.====Our paper contributes to several strands in the economics literature on crime, money laundering, and social networks. First, our model is inspired by applications of network theory in industrial organization, in particular the game-theoretic model of Goyal and Joshi (2003) on the formation of inter-firm alliance networks. The key contribution of our paper to this literature is the endogenization of the crime-market entry choice, which naturally arises in our context and is common to crime models since the seminal work by Becker (1968). In this regard, our model is also closely related to other recent extensions of Becker’s original model that look at the role of asset forfeiture (see e.g., Bowles et al., 2000; Miceli and Johnson, 2016) or money laundering (see e.g., Ferwerda, 2009) in this framework.====Second, our policy analysis comes closest to other recent applications of network theory to crime, in particular the key player policies developed in Ballester et al. (2006). The authors develop a simple sufficient statistic to identify the key player in a given network of agents who make their optimal activity levels dependent on the activity levels of their neighbors in the network. In their definition, the key player is the agent who once removed, leads to the largest reduction in aggregate activity. In our model, in contrast, the network is endogenously formed, whereby in equilibrium all criminals are equally central. It is thus optimal for a law enforcement agency to randomly target all agents and their network connections in our context.====Third, our policy analysis is also related to the model of Gaigné and Zenou (2015) who theoretically show that an increase in the budget spent on fighting crime (financed by a tax increase) can have an ambiguous effect. On the one hand, the additional money spent on police forces has a direct crime reducing effect. On the other hand, the additional tax may force people into crime, as their net incomes decrease. Just like in their model, we also consider one of the typical trade-offs that a law enforcement agency has to face. Different from their paper, this is the decision of how much money to optimally spend on several alternative policies to fight crime in our case.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

This analysis explores the economic plausibility of the legal regime, with the applicable legal standard capturing the impact of debt restructuring on the debtor's expected compliance with fiscal rules. Our theory shows that the effect of debt cuts on fiscal compliance depends on three effects, the direction of which determines the overall effect on expected fiscal compliance. We empirically review the plausibility of our theoretical results by exploiting survey data from members of state parliaments in Germany. Data limitations notwithstanding, our results offer some plausibility that haircuts can make fiscal compliance more attractive and likely.","Haircuts are controversial instruments of sovereign debt restructuring. While being discussed for a long-time in relation to debt relief for developing countries (Das et al., 2012, Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2006), haircuts have recently loomed prominently in the European sovereign debt crisis (Hofmann, 2017, Steinbach, 2016). Debt restructuring has evoked comparatively less legal controversy where bonds held by private investors are concerned (Zettelmeyer et al., 2013), yet controversies centered around the request for Greek debt restructuring held by public creditors as precondition for financial assistance – the IMF insisted on debt restructuring involving public creditors, the EU opposed it due to legal boundaries. EU legal rules impede the scope for restructuring sovereign debt to the extent that EU institutions or EU Member States relinquish their creditor position. The no-bailout principle enshrined in EU law dictates strict fiscal responsibility, and may hinder non-market based debt relief as having the equivalent effect of a debt bailout (Steinbach, 2016). Policy-makers opposing debt restructuring have invoked the EU no-bailout clause to sustain their refusal to agree to nominal cuts of Greek debt (Hofmann, 2017). A recurrent argument associated with the application of the ban on bailouts is moral hazard concern infused by debt cuts undermining the debtor country's fiscal compliance efforts.====From a legal perspective, the lively discussion on the economic desirability of debt cuts for the purpose of Greek debt relief (Eichengreen et al., 2018) raises the question of whether the EU legal standards can claim economic plausibility. Since the EU legal benchmark is concerned about maintaining budgetary responsibility and compliance with fiscal rules, our economic analysis seeks to assess the effect of debt cuts taking into consideration that moral hazard is relevant for a country's expected compliance with fiscal rules. The theoretical analysis shows that the effect of debt cuts on fiscal rule compliance depends on the sign and strength of three effects, which together determine the overall effect. The first effect is the induced reduction in interest and principal repayment, which makes compliance with a fiscal rule more likely (direct static effect). The second effect is a dynamic effect, as a debt cut raises the expectation that future debt relief (here modeled as reduction in future interest rate on government debt) is induced (direct dynamic effect). The third effect captures expectations about the consequences on non-compliance with the rule, whose sign is ambiguous a priori (indirect effect). A debt cut increases the probability of compliance with the balanced budget rule if it lowers the perceived probability of soft consequences. In the reverse case, the probability of soft consequences goes up, the first two effects and the third effect move in opposite direction, making the overall effect of a debt cut on the compliance probability a priori unclear. Upon a debt reduction it becomes easier to comply because the fiscal burden from debt is relaxed, but at the same time the expectation for future debt relief rise as do the incentives to rely on soft consequences in case of fiscal rule violation go up, thereby making the net effect ambiguous.====On that basis, we examine the direction of the theoretically ambiguous effect empirically by looking at two different case studies. First we exploit survey data from two survey rounds of members of 16 state parliaments in Germany about the German debt brake, a national fiscal rule in Germany that limits state government to achieve a structurally balanced budget from 2020 onwards. The results suggest some plausibility that haircuts can make fiscal compliance more attractive and likely. The advantage of the German case study is that the expectations about fiscal rule violation are directly asked for (as captured by the indirect effect described above). A downside is that a fiscal rule in the German context is fairly specific and insights may not easily hold in other contexts. We therefore consider a second case, the recent (non-)compliance of Italy with the Stability and Growth Pact in 2018, which is much closer to the debate on haircuts and moral hazard issues. While we do not know for sure the expectations of the new Italian government about the changes in the likelihood of soft or harsh consequences in case of violating the Stability and Growth Pact, we deduce from the Italian government's budgetary plan for 2019 that the indirect effect moves in the same direction as the direct effects. However, since the budgetary plan was not fully accepted by the EU Commission, conclusions must be drawn with care. For our legal analysis, the results from the two case studies suggest re-visiting the legal interpretation given to applicable legal standards under EU rules. A limitation of our analysis is associated with the modeling of the debt cut as exogenous event, rather than allowing for endogenous factors to determine future debt cuts, which offers avenues for future research.====There is a large literature in economics on fiscal rules. Debrun et al. (2008) were one of the first to document the use of national and European fiscal rules in EU countries and examined the effect of fiscal rules on fiscal outcomes, which has been the subject of a fairly large number of articles, for example, Eyraud et al. (2018), Heinemann et al. (2018), and Asatryan et al. (2018). A crucial issue in this literature is the causal identification of effects from fiscal rules. Based on Swiss experience, Feld et al. (2017) argue that well-designed fiscal rules lower the risk premium of sovereign bonds and thereby contribute to sound public finances. In addition, Reuter (2019) analyses the determinants of fiscal rule compliance. He finds that compliance with rules is higher if the rules are (i) specified in terms of a stock rather than a flow variable, (ii) fixed in a coalitional agreement, and iii) cover larger parts of general government finances. We differ from those studies by looking at the expectations about the consequences of fiscal rule violations.====The article is structured as follows: Section 2 sets out the legal framework applicable under EU law to debt restructuring. Section 3 offers a theoretical model capturing how the probability of compliance with a fiscal rules changes given a debt cut and initial bailout expectations. On that basis, we empirically explore the direction of effects from debt cuts. Section 4 infers from the results an economically sound interpretation of legal rules.

The lighthouse is presented as the quintessential public good as it was inherently non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Since the work of Ronald Coase (1974) on the lighthouse, economists have debated the extent to which the private provision of public goods is possible. We argue that there is no a priori basis to consider lighthouses are a public good, being both rivalrous and excludable. We highlight recent findings in the history of lighting services (especially private provision of said services) to illustrate why it may be incorrect to consider the lighthouse as a public good for two reasons. First, lighthouses are complements to other maritime services (e.g. pilotage, docking, ballastage). The lighthouse could have been bundled with these complements, which were excludable and rivalrous, in ways that would have permitted its provision. Second, organizations in charge of providing lighthouses were aware of this bundling possibility and lobbied hard to monopolize these other aspects of the trade in ways that limited entrepreneurial opportunities.","In economics, lighthouses are presented as the quintessential public good.

Its place in “economic lore” can be well assessed by the litany of articles on the question of its provision (Coase, 1974; Van Zandt, 1993; Taylor, 2001; Bertrand, 2006, 2009; Krause, 2015; Lai et al., 2008a, 2008b; Lindberg, 2013, 2015; Barnett and Block, 2007, Block and Barnett, 2009; Carnis, 2013, 2014; Candela and Geloso, 2018a,b,c, 2019; Mixon and Bridges, 2018; Saito, 2019).====What this literature has in common is that it begins, from an analytic starting point, that lighthouses ==== public goods, and then either reinforces or challenges this claim with empirical evidence, or lack thereof, to support whether or not lighthouses are in fact public goods. In the present paper, we argue why there is no ==== basis in economic theory for economists to begin from the premise that lighthouses are a public good. We base our claim, following Cowen (1985), that non-excludability and non-rivalry are not exogenous features of any good, but are endogenous to their institutional context, lighthouses being no different from other economic goods. We stress this point in order to ask the following question: why has the lighthouse been considered a public good in the first place?====Since the publication of Ronald Coase’s article (1974) on the ability of private entrepreneurs to build and operate lighthouses in Britain between the 16th and 19th centuries, a consensus has formed around the idea that the provision of the lighthouse there existed with some form of state intervention beyond the mere enforcement of property rights (Van Zandt, 1993; Taylor, 2001; Bertrand, 2006, 2009; Barnett and Block, 2007; Block and Barnett, 2009; Carnis, 2013, 2014). In this literature, the focus has been exclusively on the lighthouse rather than the broader market for maritime safety provided by other means. The two exceptions are Carnis (2013, 2014) and Candela and Geloso (2018a,b,c). Both exceptions argue for the need to look beyond the market for lighthouses in order to include substitutes and complements relevant to maritime safety that open the door to bundling opportunities and reduce the amplitude of the free-rider problem. We believe that this is an underexploited insight.====Historically, maritime safety was provided through a plethora of different services meant to reduce the likelihood of being shipwrecked (or beached). This included services like ballastage (filling the bottom of an empty ship with sand to give it stability) or pilotage (local experts boarding at safe points to guide foreign ships to ports). These services were purely private goods – they were excludable and rivalrous. They were also complements to lighthouses. For example, a pilot’s efficiency would be superior if he had access to a lighthouse. This opens the door the possibility for firms to bundle the production of private goods and public goods in ways that can price in free-riders (Bakos and Brynjolfsson, 1999). As Cornes and Sandler (1984, 1986) pointed out, once joint production of private and public goods is possible, most of the conditions behind the conventional wisdom regarding the provision of pure public goods no longer hold. More importantly, the complementarity between the goods brings out a capacity to privatize the whole bundle even if one of its components is a public good. The complements to the lighthouse have never, to the best of our knowledge, been considered in the economics literature.====The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we look beyond the original case study that Coase analyzed and illustrate the variety of mechanisms across time and place by which entrepreneurs were able to exclude and price lighting services, and is currently overlooked by economists. Such excludability and pricing operated through bundling, which often occurred with services such as pilotage and ballastage. Maritime historians have long been aware that such bundling occurred frequently (see notably McKenzie, 2003, 2006; Clancy, 1984; Adams and Woodman, 2013; Finger, 2010; Leclerc, 1989, 2003). This differs slightly from Coase (1974) and others (Bertrand, 2006; Barnett and Block, 2007) who emphasized bundling through harbors (whose provision of docking services permits exclusion). We argue that this bundling channel, which is not mutually exclusive to that of bundling with docking services, has been historically more important and far more adopted by economic actors on the ground. The fact that this bundling mechanism has been overlooked has been due to its monopolization through rent-seeking.====This sets the stage for our second contribution, which is to explain why the lighthouse has been the textbook example of a public good. The actors who were aware of the ability to bundle frequently pushed for legal enshrinement of monopoly rights over services complementary to the lighthouse and, as such, they crowded-out most bundling mechanisms. Beginning in the 13th century, rulers and associations of pilots frequently engaged in political exchanges (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962) in which the rulers exchanged legal monopoly (and the rents they produced) to pilots in exchange for a share of the rent and the purposes of reducing the odds of invasion by other foreign rulers. Gradually, the association of pilots also began to monopolize other complementary services such as ballastage. In the process, this political exchange meant that monopolization prevented the emergence of market solutions that tied pilotage to lighthouses. We also highlight that it was in the Americas (Canada and the United States) during the colonial era, when and where pilotage monopolies were weak or nonexistent, that we find most evidence for this bundling and that it was only ==== entry in the pilotage trade was restrained that lighthouses became publicly provided.====By monopolizing the most efficient mechanisms that would have allowed private provision of lighthouses, pilotage guilds and associations left only limited options for private provision notably relying on pre-provision exclusion (e.g. subscriptions and lotteries), ostracism of free-riders and innovation to reduce the amplitude of the free-rider problem to overcome. In so doing, it appeared to economists who first studied the lighthouse in the 19==== century that it could not be a private good. In other words, the perception of market failure made by economists was endogenous to a government failure in earlier rounds that went unstudied.",Why consider the lighthouse a public good?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819300638,13 August 2019,2019,Research Article,178.0

The recent Chinese Communist Party (Party)’s policy mandating all SOEs to amend their corporate charters to enhance the Party’s control has provided us with a rare opportunity to empirically investigate this question. We find that the state’s equity interest is positively correlated with an SOE’s responsiveness to the Party’s mandate, while the concentration level of nonstate owners and overseas listing are inversely related. These results show that ownership is important for the Party to exercise control over SOEs, but the Party also faces external constraints from other nonstate owners and overseas regulators and investors.","Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs)==== burst onto the world stage in the 2000s. They are topping the Global Fortune 500, exporting their products and services all over the world, and aggressively snapping up assets in foreign countries. As China becomes more integrated with the global economy, Chinese SOEs are increasingly subject to regulatory control in foreign jurisdictions (Li, 2017). Yet the growing prowess of Chinese SOEs has inspired a mix of awe and skepticism (Zhang, 2014). Although many Chinese SOEs have adopted a modern corporate governance structure and are listed on domestic and foreign stock exchanges (Lin and Chang, 2018), their ties with the Chinese Communist Party (“Party”) have not been completely severed. Foreign regulators have long pondered the extent of the Party’s control over these SOEs, an issue that is central to their investigation of the independence of the SOEs (Milhaupt and Zheng, 2015; Zhang, 2017). While some suggest that the Party has extensive control over the decision-making of Chinese SOEs (McGregor, 2012), others maintain that Chinese SOEs enjoy greater managerial autonomy than generally assumed (Milhaupt and Zheng, 2015). However, aside from qualitative and anecdotal evidence, we know very little about the extent of the Party’s control over Chinese SOEs, whether Party policies are indeed followed in practice, and what determines the effectiveness of the Party’s control. This also explains why some scholars have begun to cast doubt on whether the Chinese government can indeed exercise effective control over its SOEs (Milhaupt and Zheng, 2015).====A recent Party’s call to tighten its grip over the State sector provides us with a rare opportunity to empirically investigate the above questions about ownership and political control. Since 2015, the Party has mandated all SOEs to amend their corporate charters specifically to enhance the Party’s leadership (Guo and Dongyang, 2017). This event is a natural experiment for us to observe the determinants of individual SOEs’ responses to the Party’s top-down policy. We confine the period of our investigation from August 24, 2015, the first time the Party announced its policy, until September 30, 2018.==== Because the governance of many Chinese SOEs is rather opaque, our empirical analysis focuses on the SOEs that are listed on Chinese domestic stock exchanges. We find that 900 SOEs, accounting for over 83% of all the publicly listed SOEs, amended their corporate charters during this period.====Specifically, we measure the responsiveness of an SOE to the Party’s call in two dimensions—one is the speed of each firm in adopting the charter, and the other is the extensiveness of the amendment. Although the Party has instructed all the SOEs to amend their charters, we observe a variance among them in reacting to the Party’s policy, with some amending more quickly than others. We thus use a firm’s reaction speed as a proxy to measure the government’s cost to implement its policy. The quicker a firm responds to the Party’s call, the lower the cost for the government to push forward its policy. We believe the responsiveness of SOEs to the Party’s mandate serves as a useful proxy for political control. To facilitate the charter amendments, the Chinese government has drawn up a detailed template for SOEs to enhance Party-building in their corporate charters. Yet among those SOEs that have amended their charters, we identify a significant variance in the amendment language. Some SOEs underwent extensive amendment elaborating on the specific mechanisms allowing the Party to exercise decisive influence over the firm, while others only used vague language without providing much detail.==== We hence conducted a content analysis of the provisions in the new amendments, similar to the approach scholars have employed in studying firm-level corporate governance (Bebchuk et al., 2009). We believe that the extensiveness of the charter amendment also reflects the responsiveness of SOEs to the Party’s policy. That is, the more extensive is the charter amendment, the more responsive is the SOE to the Party’s call, and the more political control the Party exerts over the SOE, and vice versa.====Our findings show that ownership is indeed associated with the Party’s intervention in the SOEs. More specifically, the higher the state ownership, the more quickly (and also the more likely that) the SOE amend its charter.==== For instance, SOEs that are absolutely controlled by the government, i.e. those in which state shares exceed 50%, react more quickly to the Party’s call than those that are relatively less controlled by the government. At the same time, the more concentrated the non-state owners, the less likely it is for the SOE to amend its charter. This suggests that the existence of non-state owners could make it costlier for the Party to push forward its policy. Consistent with traditional views, these results show that equity interest is indeed important for the Party to exercise control over the SOEs. However, ownership does not provide the Party with unbridled control. We also find that amendments by cross-listed SOEs are less extensive than those solely listed in China, even though cross-listed firms are not significantly less likely to adopt the amendment. This seems to suggest that while cross-listed firms are under the same pressure to amend their charters, they are bounded by the tighter overseas regulatory environment and therefore appear more reserved during the amendment.====The above results show that the Party is pragmatic in its push to strengthen its control over SOEs. Although all SOEs are by definition controlled by the State, the Party is aware of the idiosyncrasies of publicly listed SOEs, which represent a group of highly visible and competitive businesses in China. The Party did not attempt to amend the charters of these SOEs overnight, rather, it had patiently coordinated with other major stakeholders who might voice objections to the amendment. This partly explains the near 100% approval rate these firms have been able to achieve during charter amendment. In fact, there has been only one occasion an SOE failed to gain the super majority vote at the shareholders’ meeting, and the proposal was approved a few months later.==== Our results also demonstrate that the Party is willing to make compromises when its policy could lead to a clash with overseas regulatory requirements. Indeed, the Party has shown willingness to relax its political control over those SOEs listed overseas.====Identifying the determinants of political control has important policy implications. As Chinese firms expand overseas and actively conduct business in those markets, foreign policymakers have often been confronted with the difficult task of identifying the extent of the Party’s intervention in the corporate decision-making of Chinese SOEs (Zhang, 2012). In Europe, antitrust regulators have wrestled with whether they should assume the same level of government intervention over different types of SOEs (Zhang, 2012). This would have a significant impact on merger assessment, and indeed some scholars have called on EU regulators to treat all Chinese SOEs in the same manner, regardless of whether they are centrally or locally owned (Riley, 2016). Petit (2016) went further, calling on policymakers to treat all Chinese firms, state-owned or not, to be part of a China, Inc. as long as it had established within itself a Party organization. Similar questions have confronted US regulators, as ownership has been a focal point for their decision-making on various regulatory fronts such as trade, foreign investment, and anti-corruption (Milhaupt and Zheng, 2015). By providing a more nuanced understanding of the factors that matter for determining the level of political control over an SOE, our research contributes to the ongoing policy and regulatory debate about how to conduct proper scrutiny on Chinese SOEs.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

We show that the use of esteem and stigma can indeed lead to a loss of control by generating multiple equilibria, some of which feature high levels of compliance and high levels of stigma. Moreover, the deterrent effect of monetary and esteem incentives is interdependent. If both types of incentives are costly to implement, esteem incentives should optimally be used relatively more for rare behaviors and in societies that have more heterogeneous values.","The desire for a good reputation is an important driver of human behavior. Policy makers attempt to harness this motive through regulations that affect the allocation of esteem and stigma. For instance, law-makers determine the visibility of transgressions by the decision to either expunge criminal records or to make them available to employers and credit agencies. A more extreme example is the public registration of sex offenders, for instance via Megan's law in the United States.==== With the advent of the internet, the availability of ever more personal information, social networks and modern surveillance techniques increases the opportunities to affect esteem. Several social credit score systems are currently being tested in China, which give each citizen a public score based on “good behavior” and apply (so far modest) penalties to low scores.====Legal scholars have vigorously debated the desirability of incentives based on reputation. Proponents like Brennan and Pettit (2004) argue for increased use of esteem and stigma as it is a cheap and powerful tool of deterrence. Similarly, Kahan and Posner (1999: 366) argue that “Shaming [...] may offer a cost-effective and politically acceptable alternative to the short terms of imprisonment that such offenders now typically receive.” By contrast, critics argue that shaming is a blunt and unpredictable instrument. By delegating punishment to the public, the effect of such sanctions is hard to control.==== In an influential critique, Whitman (1998) writes:====Again, these concerns become more pertinent with the availability of electronic surveillance and the possibility to share information on social platforms. Hess and Waller (2014) and Ronson (2015) discuss the unpredictable nature of online trolling and mobbing, leading to outsized punishment for relatively small infractions.====In this paper, we analyze the use of esteem and the potential loss of control in a signaling model, based on Bénabou and Tirole (2011). This is a simple and tractable framework to capture reputation and compliance behavior that is increasingly popular in theoretical work on ethical decision making and social norms. In the model, an authority interacts with a continuum of agents, who decide whether to engage in an activity that is personally costly but generates positive externalities. Agents are assumed to have three motivations. First, they care about the personal (monetary) payoffs from the action. Second, agents have different “values” or “intrinsic motivation” for complying with the law, and this preference type is private information. Third, people care about their reputation, modeled as the expectation other people have about their values. This expectation is conditional on the observed action, giving rise to an incentive effect of reputation.====In this framework, we investigate the deterrent effect of two policy instruments: a traditional monetary incentive and a reputation-based “esteem incentive”. The latter consists of an increase in the visibility of the agents actions, thereby increasing the amount of esteem that agents can reap by complying with formal rules, or conversely, the amount stigma associated with breaking them. We analyze the deterrent effect of both incentives in the context of a perfect Bayesian, semi-separating Nash equilibrium, and study how the two interact.====Our results provide several new insights to the use of esteem and stigma as a deterrence tool in economic and legal settings. First, we show the conditions under which both incentives are mutually reinforcing. This is the case for relatively high levels of compliance, where incentives raise the informativeness of behavior about the underlying character of the agent. Second, we show that unlike monetary incentives, increasing the visibility of actions can indeed lead to a “loss of control” for the authority. A high level of such incentives can induce multiple equilibria with different compliance levels, especially in situations where compliance is not too costly, and the distribution of values in society is relatively homogeneous.====Third, we show that if both incentives are costly to implement, reputation-based incentives are used relatively more for extreme behaviors, as these are most informative about the underlying character of the agent and hence yield a stronger deterrent effect. This explains why shaming is used mostly for rare and extreme behaviors like sex offenses. We also show that reputation-based incentives are used relatively more in a society with more heterogeneous or polarized values, as in such societies actions reflect larger differences moral values, and hence generate more stigma.====With these results, we contribute to the literature on stigma and shame in legal policy, which we review below. Contrary to previous literature, our model abstracts from the exact use of reputation, for instance in the labor market. In return, it allows a clear characterization of how penalties based on esteem interact with more traditional incentives, the relative use of different policy instruments, and the conditions under which a “loss of control” can occur. While these insights are only one step in understanding the complex interplay of different policies, they are important in a world with ever increasing connectivity.",On esteem-based incentives,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818302345,8 July 2019,2019,Research Article,182.0

In a lab experiment, we first analyze the determinants of the litigants’ willingness to bargain. Then we investigate the impact of a bargaining obligation on the litigants’ behavior during the negotiation, by varying both the probability that the constraint is enforced and payoff asymmetry between parties. We show that the willingness to bargain depends on one's relative advantage in terms of expected judgment levels (after or instead of a pretrial settlement attempt), on gender and on the probability of being effectively constrained. We also highlight that players who are forced to bargain are more inclined to concessions within the negotiation than the pairs which freely bargain. Finally, we show that forced bargaining leads to more egalitarian agreements. Our results may have important implications in terms of public policy regarding mandatory mediation.","The large law and economics theoretical literature on litigation has led to a very high number of fundamental insights since the 1980s. In this literature, the pretrial settlement is regarded as welfare enhancing in that it may avoid costly trials (Landes, 1971, Gould, 1973). Broadly speaking, if the conditions under which an offer is acceptable from the respondent are fulfilled, then the settlement is assumed to hold. In our view, one element is absent from that literature, i.e. how the pretrial settlement stage is introduced. Indeed, in theoretical models, either a pretrial settlement stage is assumed, or it is absent. But in reality, the will of parties to go to such a settlement step should be decisive for it to happen, as it determines the occurrence of this step and henceforth, its outcome.====More precisely, in common practice, parties may be willing or not to go to a settlement stage. Logically, in the latter case, no pretrial negotiation should occur. But they can happen to be constrained by law to attempt to settle. Mandatory mediation or conciliation procedures==== are generalized to all civil disputes in some countries such as Switzerland==== or France.==== In some other countries, mandatory mediation is gaining ground. Thus, in the United States, many states have statutes that give their courts the latitude to order conflicting parties to mediation when deemed appropriate, and many of those have now turned to enacting additional legislation to order parties to mediation before the conflict is allowed before the court (Rifleman, 2005).====This evolution has raised many debates among legal scholars and professionals, some of whom question the legitimacy of mandatory mediation. Proponents observe notably that parties who go through mandatory mediation may eventually settle while they are initially unwilling to mediate (Hardy, 2008) and that such process makes them familiar with mediation and helps them overcome their dispute (Quek, 2010). Opponents argue that mediation is by essence a consensual procedure that relies on the willingness of the parties to the dispute (Ingleby, 1993). In this regard, “forced participation in mediation not only conflicts with the quality processes of traditional mediation, but can actually result in a “bad faith” participation (Boettger, 2004), or a negative impact on the parties where one or both parties actually participate half-heartedly just to get the process to the next procedural stage – litigation.” (Rifleman, 2005).====Following this debate, analyzing the influence of coercive mediation on litigants’ behavior may have important policy implications for the evaluation and the design of existing disputes’ resolution mechanisms. If coercing individuals into mediation (or more generally, into bargaining) distorts their behavior compared to a situation where mediation is freely chosen, then depending on the nature of such a distortion, a decision-maker might want either to exploit it or avoid it. In the same idea, if compulsory bargaining is equivalent to free bargaining in terms of welfare, or even performs better, then the introduction of mandatory mediation appears relevant.==== Finally, the question of whether a mediation obligation benefits more to one litigant or to the other (the initially advantaged or the disadvantaged litigant), has distribution implications which should also enter the criteria of a decision-maker, especially if an advantage in bargaining is a proxy for the merit of the case.====Yet, the potential link between the nature of negotiation (i.e. mandatory or voluntary) and the bargaining outcome has received very little attention in economics certainly because, from a purely theoretical standpoint, the way the bargaining arises should not matter. Indeed, whatever the way the negotiations are implemented ====, the strategic elements characterizing the bargaining relationship ==== are identical and the parties’ behavior should not be altered. Thus, according to this view, the willingness of parties to bargain should not impair the terms of bargaining, which should thus be identical whether the parties initially chose to bargain or refused but were forced to. However, we believe that such a conclusion abstracts from behavioral considerations which may have a considerable impact in real-world bargaining interactions. In particular, following the motivation crowding theory, intrinsic motivation may be undermined by external interventions if agents perceive them as controlling, leading them to reduce their initial willingness to make efforts in order to fulfill a given task (Frey and Jegen, 2001). In the context of constrained bargaining environment, such a constraint might have a deterrent impact on the intrinsic motivation to reach an agreement and, hence, lead bargainers to behave more aggressively in the negotiation, even in cases where both initially wanted to negotiate anyway. Furthermore, a closely related question is related to the determinants of litigants’ willingness to bargain, as mandatory mediation may mean (or not) coercion, depending precisely on their initial willingness to bargain. This implies that one has first to identify the key-determinants of the willingness to bargain in order to understand why some litigants might not want to bargain. And second, one has to answer to whether litigants who are constrained to bargain behave differently from those who are not, and also to whether coercion may distort the bargaining behavior of litigants who initially wanted to bargain.====To tackle this issue, we conduct a decontextualized laboratory experiment to investigate the impact of constraint on bargaining in a wide range of situations. In our experimental design, external payoffs drawn from some uniform distributions are granted to subjects who do not bargain (outside options) as well as to those who do not reach an agreement in bargaining (disagreement payoffs). Moreover, should they initially wish or refuse to bargain, they can be forced to bargain with some probability varying from 0 to 1 which is common knowledge and revealed from the start. The comparison with subjects who bargain without constraint allows to isolate the effect of the environment (constrained versus not constrained) and to investigate whether the mere fact of being constrained modifies a player's behavior. Finally, we vary the (a)symmetry in terms of payoffs, by implementing symmetric (50/50) payoffs and asymmetric ones (40/60).====We show first that the willingness to bargain depends on several factors, such as the relative advantage in terms of expected external payoffs and the probability of being effectively constrained, as a higher probability leads to a higher willingness to negotiate. Then we highlight that the demands’ level depends on the relative bargaining power of players, in the sense that the most (least) advantaged player makes more (less) concessions in the bargaining than the other one. We also show that the demands’ level and bargaining outcome depend on gender, women shying away from negotiation more often and asking for less than men. These results are in line with empirical results from the literature on gender and bargaining (Eckel et al., 2008). Besides, players who are effectively constrained to bargain (i.e. those who refused to bargain but are imposed to) are less aggressive than those having chosen to negotiate. Finally, the latter result leads to a lower inequality between players in the agreement when bargaining is imposed to them, which might be taken into account by the decision maker. The implications of our results in terms of public policy may be important. No matter whether the negotiation is imposed by law or by a judge, the decision-maker who decides whether to impose a negotiation (for example a mediation) should take into account that making bargaining mandatory does not seem to alter the chances of settlement: parties who are unwilling to bargain are not less likely to find an agreement than others. Thus, if the only objective of a decision-maker is to maximize the settlement rate, then mandatory mediation makes sense.==== Second, coercing litigants into mediation might lead to lower aggressiveness from the bargainers and to more equality. One has to be cautious on this point: indeed, if some inequality in terms of external payoffs reflects a gap in terms of merit of the case, then a decision-maker might prefer to avoid lowering inequality induced by the negotiated agreement and thus avoid imposing bargaining.====In terms of contribution to the literature, this article first contributes to the experimental literature on bargaining and asymmetric disagreement outcomes, which departs from Hoffman and Spitzer (1982). They analyze unstructured bargaining games and take two random disagreement outcomes, their design involving face-to-face bargaining. Most other papers related to this topic are lab experiments. They implement different bargaining environments, and most of them show a significant impact of the bargaining position over the demands and bargaining outcomes, though less than predicted by theory. Fischer et al. (2007) analyze to what extent the subjects change their demands as their bargaining position improves in two different bargaining environments, the ultimatum game and the Nash demand game==== whereas Binmore et al. (1991) choose an alternating offers bargaining game such as in Rubinstein (1982). Anbarci and Feltovich (2013) also investigate this question, both in a Nash demand game and a unstructured bargaining game, but in their experiment, disagreement payoffs are drawn randomly from distributions with nearly continuous support, whereas previous experiments allowed a small number of discrete values. Hennig-Schmidt et al. (2018) make a systematic analysis over asymmetric outside options in ultimatum bargaining, by designing five treatments employing a game with a specific outside option. Our experiment is mostly related to Anbarci and Feltovich (2013) given the nature of our game (unstructured bargaining game) and the quite important range of disagreement payoffs we have in our experiment. However, none of the previous experiments on bargaining implements a first decision made by subjects over whether to bargain or not.====Our findings also contribute to the literature on gender and bargaining. Eckel et al. (2008) survey research from previous experiments on gender using the dictator and the ultimatum games and note that the majority of studies analyzing the impact of gender on bargaining find that women tend to be more egalitarian than men, and expect and ask for less than men in the negotiation (see e.g. Eckel and Grossman, 1998, Eckel and Grossman, 2001. Similar results have been found in the field, women being more likely to accept an initial salary offer (Babcock and Laschever, 2003) and initiating a negotiation less often than men (Babcock et al., 2006, Small et al., 2007).====Finally, this paper contributes to the sparse empirical literature on bargaining constraints. Gabuthy and Lambert (2013) compare negotiations which take place after a first decision whether to bargain, and those which take place without such a previous choice. Though the players are more aggressive in the first case, this design does not allow to isolate the impact of constraint, since in the second case, individuals are not aware of being constrained. In the present paper, we isolate the pure effect of a constrained environment. Our design indeed allows to compare the behavior of subjects who want to bargain and are not constrained, of those who want to bargain and are constrained anyway, and of those who do not want to bargain and are forced to do so. In terms of public policy, our paper drives conclusions which might be of interest to the decision maker as we show that the impact of constraint on people's bargaining behavior is significant.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

Eagly’s empirical analysis provided evidence that respondents who appear before judges via video feed are significantly less likely to engage in the procedural processes of the proceedings and are ultimately more likely to receive a removal order than those who appear in-person.

Researcher discretion is surprisingly large, regarding both choice of which question to ask and choice of which methods to employ. Therefore, I conclude, transparency in exercising said researcher discretion is important when assessing how replication results relate to original results.","A preference for original discovery over direct replication seems to be axiomatic in our scientific culture. New theoretical insights and empirical results must be novel to increase one's outlook for publication. By contrast, publishing derivative work in highly ranked journals is next to impossible. As a consequence, there is very little incentive for researchers, especially at the beginning of their careers, to conduct direct replication studies. To date, replication is a generally neglected and certainly undervalued exercise.====However, original discovery and replication go hand in hand in order to elevate mere observation to scientific evidence (Popper, 2002, pp. 23–24). Arguably, direct replication may even be more valuable for scientific progress than original discovery (Ioannidis, 2018). Be that as it may, the necessity of replication certainly becomes more pressing in a world of publication bias, inflated effect sizes, and small samples. As a consequence, some call for making replication mainstream (cf. Zwaan et al., 2018). How can we otherwise confidently deliver appropriate policy recommendations?====While direct replications are sufficiently methodologically similar to the original study and, therefore, test the basic existence of a phenomenon, most contributions to this special issue take one step more and test the relevance of auxiliary hypotheses or include some other robustness check. For instance: (1) the original analysis may be conducted on an extended data set or on a different sample; (2) the researchers check the robustness of prior results in cases where data may have been re-coded by the data provider; (3) or the researchers use alternative identification strategies or methodological approaches. Therefore, the contributions here investigate, each in its own way, the validity and generalizability of the previous findings.====Unfortunately, most of the papers are somewhat silent about evaluating their replication results and, specifically, about how their results compare to the original results. At the very least, the papers do not critically evaluate the results of such comparison or of the employed methods. The goal of replication analysis is to assess how replication results relate to the original results and, possibly, other previous findings. However, as the question of whether a finding is quantitatively and/or qualitatively replicated is complex, no clear consensus has so far been reached on which methods to employ to assess the consistency between replication results and original results.====In this short note, I briefly survey common approaches to assess replication results, including different questions and methods that researchers can address and employ in replication analysis. Naturally, this overview is not exhaustive. Moreover, I adopt the perspective of an experimentalist. Nevertheless, most considerations extend to non-experimental replications. I also argue for employing Bayesian methods to evaluate how replication results compare to original results as, in my view, they are better suited to fit in newly gathered information with an existing knowledge base.",A note on replication analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819301395,5 June 2019,2019,Research Article,185.0

They suggest, based on this claim, that NPAs ought to be used infrequently. This article presents a signalling model wherein reputational sanctions emerge as a result of noisy signals produced through a firm's prosecution. It is shown that, if, as claimed, NPAs provide third parties with less information regarding a firm's wrongdoings, then firms would be willing to pay an ==== to avoid convictions. Thus, the NPA premium can be chosen to induce only those firms which would otherwise be over-deterred to accept NPAs. Therefore, offering NPAs with high premia is superior to the option of not using NPAs. The article also characterizes optimal NPAs, and identifies relationships between deterrence; frequency of NPA use; firms’ characteristics; and NPA terms. It explains how these relationships can be exploited to form and test hypotheses on whether convictions obtained through plea-bargains cause greater reputational harm to firms than NPAs.","Companies can be, and frequently are, held liable for the crimes committed by their employees. In addition to seeking a conviction through plea-bargains, prosecutors also have the option of entering into negotiated agreements with companies. These agreements take two broad forms called non-prosecution agreements (NPAs) and deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs). An NPA allows a company to avoid prosecution in exchange for its (costly) cooperation.==== On the other hand, prosecutors can (and do) file criminal charges against the company following a DPA, but, these charges are dismissed upon the passage of a certain amount of time in which the company complies with specified requirements. To reduce wordage, in what follows, I refer to both types of negotiated agreements collectively as NPAs, especially because my analysis focuses on the fact that these agreements do not result in convictions, and this is common across both types of agreements.====NPAs have been used more frequently since 2003,==== and scholarly debate regarding the wisdom of using these agreements seems to have followed. An important disagreement in the scholarly debate is on whether the use of negotiated agreements may cause a reduction in deterrence by lowering the reputational impact of enforcement schemes. In particular, one scholar suggests that NPAs ”limit the punitive and deterrent value of the government's law enforcement efforts and extinguish the societal condemnation that should accompany criminal prosecution”,==== and another states that ”[o]rganizations feared the catastrophic punitive fines and severe reputational consequences of a conviction–what one court described as a ‘matter of life and death’”==== . This view is contested by other scholars who point out that NPAs and plea-bargains provide similar signals to third parties regarding the corporation, and that they can involve similar collateral sanctions imposed by the prosecutor ((Alexander and Arlen, 2018)). Although this disagreement centers around an empirical question, it naturally has normative implications. For instance, some scholars who suggest that NPAs negatively impact deterrence deduce from this assumption that they should be used less frequently.====The goal of this article is to contribute to both the positive and normative dimensions of this debate by supplying a theoretical model that can be used to form testable hypotheses regarding the likely effects of NPAs, as well as pointing out how negotiated agreements can be used to enhance social welfare. More specifically, the analysis starts with the observation that liability (regardless of whether imposed through NPAs or plea-bargains) can cause asymmetric reputational effects on firms, because reputation is not an asset that is equally valuable to all firms.==== From a positive perspective, if as argued by some scholars, NPAs reduce reputational costs (relative to plea-bargains), then, the magnitude of the deterrence reduction effect that follows as a result of the use of NPAs would be positively related to a firms’ reputational concern. Thus, empirically identifying such effects would support the claim that convictions increase reputational sanctions. In the modeling section, the article exploits this observation further to identify nuanced effects of NPAs, which can exist only if convictions increase reputational sanctions relative to NPAs.====From a normative perspective, the variance across firms’ reputational concerns implies that corporate criminal liability can result in under- and over-deterrence problems,==== because the total sanctions faced by firms differ.==== Therefore, if NPAs reduce reputational sanctions,==== they can be used to curb over-deterrence, and, as I explain, this can be accomplished without exacerbating under-deterrence. Achieving this result requires the setting of a high ====,==== meaning that the formal sanctions (which refers to all non-reputational sanctions) associated with the NPA would have to exceed the expected formal sanctions associated with a plea-bargain.==== This type of offer would be unattractive to firms with the lowest reputational concern and would be accepted by firms who highly value their reputation, because the marginal benefit from an NPA is a reduction in reputational costs. Therefore, by setting a high NPA premium,==== only those firms which would otherwise be over-deterred can be induced to take advantage of NPAs. The result would be a reduction in over-deterrence without causing additional under-deterrence. It is worth noting that this strategy can be used only if NPAs ==== reduce deterrence. Thus, scholars who simultaneously suggest that NPAs reduce reputational sanctions, and that their use is normatively undesirable, may need to reconsider their implicit assumptions as to how NPAs can and should be implemented.====To formalize these results, in the next section, I consider an enforcement model==== where firms with varying degrees of reputational concerns choose whether or not to comply with the law.==== Firms whose non-compliance is discovered by the relevant authorities are disciplined through either NPAs or plea-bargains. To capture the idea that NPAs ==== reduce the reputational sanctions imposed on firms, I consider two types of third parties, ==== and ====, who transact with firms.==== Sophisticated parties learn about the wrongdoing of all firms which are disciplined (both through plea bargains ==== NPAs) whereas the wrongdoings of firms are revealed to unsophisticated parties only if they are disciplined through plea bargains. Thus, by choosing to resolve its dispute through an NPA instead of a plea bargain, a firm is able to preserve its perceived reputation among unsophisticated parties, although this option does not prevent it from suffering a reputational loss among sophisticated parties. Therefore, the size of the unsophisticated population affects how much NPAs reduce total reputational sanctions. If the size of this population is negligible, then, as suggested by Alexander and Arlen (2018), NPAs do not reduce reputational sanctions, and, therefore, cause no reduction in deterrence (as long as there is a positive NPA premium)==== Thus, the model includes a parameter that can be adjusted to consider either set of assumptions regarding the effect of NPAs on reputational sanctions. The behavioral patterns of actual firms can potentially be compared to the two different behavioral patterns that emerge in the model (as a function of the underlying assumption) to gain a better understanding of the true effect of NPAs on reputational sanctions.====Before presenting the model it is worth highlighting a key conceptual difference between the ‘publicity’ of the agreements being analyzed and how informed the public is about these agreements. The former concept refers to whether an NPA produces publicly ==== information==== whereas the latter refers to whether the public actually uses this information. Intuitively, negotiated agreements can reduce reputational costs even when they are public, if convictions are popularized more through media channels than negotiated agreements. Thus, the possibility of increased reputational effects due to convictions does not require the agreements to be public. Therefore, the optimal NPAs discussed in this article can be interpreted in one of two ways: first, if NPAs reduce reputational sanctions (either because they are partially private agreements or because fewer people inform themselves about NPAs compared to plea bargains) then they can be designed to reduce reputational sanctions in a way to mitigate over-deterrence, and, second, even if NPAs currently do not reduce reputational sanctions, they can be implemented more privately to have this effect and thereby reduce over-deterrence.====Given this background, additional positive and normative implications of the model are discussed in Section 2 with the help of a series of propositions whose proofs are relegated to an appendix in the end. In Section 3, I provide concluding remarks.",Optimal non-prosecution agreements and the reputational effects of convictions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818302175,24 May 2019,2019,Research Article,186.0

We begin by qualitatively replicating key results in ====, an influential paper that provided some of the first causal evidence connecting the state of the labor market (as measured by the unemployment rate) to criminal behavior (as measured by reported offense rates). Raphael and Winter-Ebmer find statistically significant positive effects of unemployment on property crime rates and a weaker and less consistent relationship between unemployment and violent crime rates. We build on this seminal work by exploring whether these estimated relationships continue to hold in more recent data. In carrying out our analysis, we find reason to consider alternative identification strategies (especially in the later period of the extended sample). We also investigate the impact of adding wages to the model, and we conduct a number of additional robustness checks. We conclude that the broad themes of Raphael and Winter-Ebmer's work remain valid, and yet additional research has the potential to reveal a more intricate and nuanced relationship between labor markets and crime.","Basic economic intuition suggests that a reduction in the number or quality of legitimate employment opportunities in an economy will render engaging in economically rewarding ==== activity more attractive to the marginal individual.==== For this reason, Becker (1968), Ehrlich (1973), and a host of subsequent papers model the frequency of criminal offenses (particularly property offenses) as a function of rational labor market choices in which criminal behavior is just another choice with associated economic payouts and penalties. If people face a choice between engaging in the traditional labor market or in criminal behavior, then the opportunities available to agents in the labor market, if there are any, as well as the expected economic returns to crime, should matter to the outcomes of these decisions.====Economists have formalized this idea in different ways. For instance, Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2001) provide grounding for their state-level empirical analysis of Uniform Crime Report (UCR) crime rates from 1971–97 by following Grogger's analysis of the crime/labor/leisure tradeoff (Grogger, 1998), which is quite close to standard static labor supply analysis with home production (see, e.g., Gronau, 1977). The underlying model implies that agents sacrifice some leisure to generate income through either criminal or traditional labor market activity. They spend income they receive from their non-leisure activities on consumption goods. Individuals thus balance the marginal rates of return from their criminal ventures and standard market employment. This model assumes diminishing marginal returns to criminal behavior, but, at least in the simplest case, constant wage rates for legitimate employment.====According to this characterization, some individuals will take part in their most lucrative criminal opportunities (those with the highest returns after accounting for expected punishment) while ==== working in the formal labor market for wages. Others may be at either extreme of this tradeoff: engaging only in legal work or only in illegal work, but not both. For individuals who do not find themselves at a corner solution, the model unambiguously predicts that worsening labor market opportunities will increase their income-generating criminal behavior. For those earning a wage that strictly surpasses the returns to crime (i.e., initially engaging in no crime), the impact on criminal behavior of lowering legitimate labor market rewards may be zero or positive depending on whether the returns to crime now exceed the ex post wage rate or the individual's reservation wage (higher reservation wages imply less criminal behavior). In a simple model, however, a change in the unemployment rate alone should not affect those engaged solely in crime.==== Thus, in this setup, each individual either has no reaction to a weaker labor market or responds by choosing to commit more crime. We should therefore expect to find a positive relationship between unemployment and criminal behavior holding all else equal, although the magnitude of this relationship depends on the population distribution of underlying preferences, criminal opportunities, and potential wage rates.====In this paper, we study the relationship between labor market opportunities and crime by revisiting Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2001) (RW), one of the earliest—and most well-known—empirical papers evaluating the predictions of this simple framework. RW take a reduced-form approach,==== but they use their theoretical discussion to identify four main determinants of criminal behavior: (1) legitimate employment opportunities, (2) criminal opportunities, (3) consumption of criminogenic commodities, and (4) the response of the criminal justice system. RW focus on the first pathway: weaker labor market conditions increase the relative returns of engaging in income-generating criminal activity and thus induce more illicit behavior.====To isolate the relative importance of changes in traditional employment opportunities, however, it is necessary to control for conditions that vary with the business cycle and that might affect criminal behavior regardless of labor market strength (e.g., alcohol consumption, criminal justice policies) and to address simultaneity bias because there are many plausible stories in which crime rates affect labor market conditions at the micro level (e.g., criminal behavior may weaken employment prospects) and the macro level (e.g., concentrated criminal activity may hamper business activity). RW attempt to control for criminogenic covariates and exploit plausible instrumental variables in the hope of isolating the impact of labor market opportunities on criminal behavior.==== Nevertheless, their effort relies on critical identifying assumptions and the representativeness of their sample. Our goal is to reexamine the relationship between labor market conditions and crime by probing and extending RW's work.====We conclude that RW's results hold in a sample we build to replicate their work. We extend the sample through 2014 (adding 17 additional years of data—final sample: 1971–2014) to study the robustness of RW's findings and discover that RW's conclusions fare less well in more recent data but nevertheless hold to a degree. Because the state-level data have certain weaknesses and the underlying model has an individual's decision-making process in mind, we also develop various extensions and robustness checks to try to confirm the patterns reflected in the aggregate analysis and to connect these patterns to individual behavioral mechanisms. These checks, such as using alternative measures of employment, applying alternative wage measures, controlling for the economic value of goods susceptible to theft, and introducing variation from taxes, show a consistent empirical relationship between labor market opportunities and crime and seem to support the importance of the mechanisms the theory emphasizes.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We begin by fitting our work into the existing literature on the economics of crime and labor supply. We then explicitly lay out the underlying behavioral model and its predictions. Next, we describe the data and highlight a few possible measurement issues. After presenting a straightforward replication of the canonical results, we extend the analysis and comment on these extensions and robustness checks. Finally, we offer a few general conclusions that emerge from our analysis.",Identifying the impact of labor market opportunities on criminal behavior,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819300043,21 May 2019,2019,Research Article,187.0

However, these are not perfect and the opponents can exploit them to build their own arguments. In this paper, we propose a new litigation success function that (i) considers the intrinsic and immutable strength of the arguments presented by the plaintiff and defendant, (ii) solves the limitations of the existing literature in dealing with the English fee-shifting system, and (iii) is flexible and tractable in analytical terms. As a robustness check, the proposed litigation success function confirms several important results in the literature, but also brings new insights on how argumentation strength affects the individuals’ efforts and the decision to file and contest lawsuits in different fee-shifting systems. In this context, we also show how to introduce the worldwide-accepted presumption of innocence in favor of the defendant and the possibility of settlement.","The decision by the plaintiff to bring a case and the decision by the defendant to defend it, depend crucially on the legal system, the value under dispute, the objective merits of the case, the strength or quality of the arguments and the costs involved. In this process, the more resources the individuals spend to produce arguments, the more likely they are to influence the court's decision in their favor. This observation establishes a link between the litigation process and the Tullock's (1980) type “rent-seeking” literature (Katz, 1988),==== and justifies why this methodology is being extensively applied to studying legal disputes.====However, the “rent-seeking” ==== (CSF) has a number of limitations. In particular, under the English system no case reaches trial because the intensity of argumentation is too high. The exception occurs in the very particular case in which the returns to scale in the production of legal arguments are decreasing and sufficiently low (Farmer and Pecorino, 1999).==== However, in this case, the introduction of realistic considerations, such as, for example, asymmetries between individuals, outside options or other aspects is analytically intractable (Dari-Mattiacci et al., 2015). Analytical tractability can be recovered by assuming constant returns to scale in the production of legal arguments, but then, as explained, no case reaches trial under the English system, which is counterfactual==== ; thereby restricting to a great extent the generalized application of the “rent-seeking” CSF, and questioning whether this approach to litigation is complete enough.==== This issue gains even more relevance because the English system is the most common fee-shifting system, and in reality we observe that disputes do reach trial.====These observations call for an alternative contest success function, which should be flexible enough to study the English system and other cases in a systematic and meaningful way.====In the present paper, we propose a new and alternative ==== (LSF) that resolves the limitations of the commonly employed CSF in dealing with the English fee shifting system in an analytically tractable model. This is the main contribution of the present paper. Individuals with strong arguments proceed to litigation regardless of the possibility that they might end up paying all the litigation costs. The decision to file a lawsuit and defend it depends on the individual arguments and not on the argumentation technology.====The present paper introduces a qualitative dimension into the argumentation effort of the plaintiff and the defendant. In this context, arguments are statements, which may include witnesses and actual testimonies (among other aspects), used to persuade someone or in support of a claim. However, they are not perfect, and part of these arguments can be exploited by the opponent to construct their own arguments. In other words, persuasion builds on the intrinsic and immutable strength of the individual's own arguments and on the weaknesses (or lack of strength) of the opponent's arguments.====Qualitative considerations in the litigation process, such as the ones in the present paper, are new to the literature. The usual approach assumes that individuals have different merits or degrees of fault. This interpretation is intuitively connected to the idea of argumentation quality. However, in technical terms both approaches are different because argumentation imperfections can be exploited by the opponent, which creates further strategic considerations.====In terms of the results obtained, we found that the fee-shifting system has a clear effect on the efforts and decision to file and contest lawsuits. The English system discourages nuisance suits by the party with lower chances of winning, which is often the party with the weaker arguments. We also found that competitive suits in which both parties hold strong arguments are unlikely to be contested because the defendant anticipates high argumentation intensity, and consequently a strong likelihood of losing and ending up paying all the litigation costs. These results are in line with the existing literature but introduce a qualitative dimension (Katz and Sanchirico, 2011; Rosenberg and Shavell, 1985, Shavell, 1982).====For the cases that reach trial, argumentation efforts are always higher under the English system than under the American system (Braeutigam et al., 1984; Farmer and Pecorino, 1999; Katz and Sanchirico, 2011). We also found that the party with better arguments spends more effort than the opponent under the English system, and enjoys a higher probability of winning at trial.====Under both systems, for cases that reach trial, improvements in the strength of arguments lead to an intensification of the argumentation efforts. However, the expected payoff increases with the strength of the individual's own arguments only if these arguments are strong enough and the value under dispute sufficiently important. Otherwise, under the English system, the increased argumentation reduces the expected payoff because the total effort (the sum of both individuals’ efforts) increases relatively faster than the individual's prospects of winning. The consideration of these effects is new to the literature.====The proposed LSF is also flexible enough to accommodate litigation specific aspects, such as, for example, bias and other merits, the possibility of settlement, cost and stake differences, among others. In this context, we also show how to introduce the worldwide-accepted presumption of innocence in favor of the defendant without affecting the analytical tractability of the problem. In addition, we found that settlement reduces the number of cases that reach trial but does not affect the intensity of litigation for those cases that do reach trial. Our results support the idea that the English system provides stronger settlement incentives than the American system (Coursey and Stanley, 1988; Katz and Sanchirico, 2011; Shavell, 1982; Snyder and Hughes, 1990).====Lastly, we note that the proposed LSF is new to the “rent-seeking” literature and is not limited to the study of litigation problems. It can be applied to general problems, in particularly to situations in which part of the individuals’ efforts spillover to the opponent as, for example, in R&D races, among other situations.====The paper is organized as follows.

Because local election competitiveness is endogenous to local government quality, my identification strategy is based on an instrumental variable approach. Exploiting the fact that voting in the local elections is highly influenced by partisanship, I use the competitiveness of the municipalities in the national elections as an instrument for their competitiveness in the local elections. The IV results suggest that more competitive municipalities have substantially lower levels of corruption.","Local governments manage a substantial part of most countries' resources, and significantly affect the life quality of their citizens. So, it is crucial to understand why some local governments function better than others. In this paper, I focus on an important aspect of local government quality: political corruption. Corruption is often defined as the “abuse of entrusted power for private gain"".==== Political corruption refers to the abuse of power by elected officials, as opposed to the extraction of bribes by civil servants (bureaucratic corruption).====Studying corruption is challenging, as it is difficult to find hard data on corrupt activities due to their illicit nature. The current study overcomes this problem by using a unique dataset that is based on audits of large Greek municipalities, conducted by the Court of Audit of Greece between 2006 and 2010. The Court reviews the payment orders that are issued by the municipal governments, and cancels those that are deemed to be illegal or irregular. Most of the cancelled payment orders are related to: public procurement contracts that were assigned without a public and open competition as the law requires; illegalities in the recruitment of employees that indicate favoritism; largesse towards municipality insiders (elected officials and employees); and other cases of mismanagement that are also typically indicative of corruption. Although it is not possible to declare with certainty that a particular cancelled payment order reflects corrupt motives, the relative prevalence of such irregularities in certain municipalities is highly likely to be the result of corrupt governance. In order to measure the level of corruption, I use the value of cancelled expenses per capita by municipality between 2006 and 2010. In its methodological approach, the current study follows a relatively recent shift of the corruption literature towards within-country studies that use data based on: audits (Olken, 2007; Ferraz and Finan, 2008, 2011; Caselli and Michaels, 2013; Brollo et al., 2013), convictions of elected officials (Glaeser and Saks, 2006), newspaper reports of scandals (Nyblade and Reed, 2008), legal rents such as public funding for parties (Svaleryd and Vlachos, 2009) or requests to suspend parliamentary immunity (Golden and Chang, 2001).====The main question that this paper addresses is whether competitive elections produce less corrupt local governments. The idea that electoral competition benefits the public goes back at least to Stigler (1972) and Wittman (1989) who draw an analogy between competition in the political and the economic markets. We have good reasons to expect that competition limits the ability of elected officials to extract rents for their own enrichment. First, competition improves the screening mechanism of democracy: when facing a large pool of viable competitors, a subpar candidate is less likely to get elected, and possibly less likely to even run in the elections. Second, competition disciplines the incumbent: mayors who face the threat of a serious challenge in the upcoming elections have to be more careful to maintain a good reputation than their counterparts who are secure in their seats. Third, competition facilitates the transmission of information: people talk about competitive races more than they talk about the less contested ones, and candidates themselves are often an important source of information (Milazzo, 2010; Jones, 2013). Since informed voters are more likely to oust corrupt incumbents (Ferraz and Finan, 2008), it is likely that this channel of causality plays an important role alongside with the screening and discipline channels.====Theoretically, though, electoral competition can backfire and cause more corruption under certain conditions. When favors buy votes, one might expect that competitive elections create more incentives to extract rents from the budget to distribute them to voters. Based on evidence from Latin America (Levitsky, 2007) and Africa (Lindberg and Morrison, 2008), Hicken (2011) writes that: ""We should expect that where clientelism is already common, politicians facing robust competition may actually increase the use of such tactics"". Since politics in Greece do exhibit some clientelistic tendencies, it is hard to form a strong prior expectation about the sign of the effect that the current study identifies. It has to be added, though, that the effect of competition on corruption is contingent on clientelism only if clientelism is actually used to target the marginal voters: voters who are not strongly in favor of the one or the other candidate, or voters who lean towards a certain candidate but whose turnout is uncertain.==== If, though, clientelism serves only to develop a small core faction of supporters and the faction as a whole pursues the votes of the rest of the electorate in non-clientelistic ways, then competition should reduce the ability of the faction to extract rents. To put it simply, if clientelism cannot target the marginal voters, then competition should constrain the clientelistic faction the same way it constrains individual politicians in non-clientelistic settings.====The empirical evidence on the effects of electoral competition on rent-seeking is mixed: Svaleryd and Vlachos (2009) find that in Sweden electoral competition results to lower wages for elected officials and less public funding for parties. Nyblade and Reed (2008) show that in Japan electoral competition increases the frequency of election law violations, but reduces the frequency of financial scandals. Golden and Chang (2001) find that intraparty competition in Italy leads to more cases of corruption, as measured by requests for suspension of parliamentary immunity.==== The current paper contributes to the existing body of work in two ways: It provides the first analysis of corruption levels within Greece, expanding the geographical scope of the literature and shedding some light on a country that has received widespread attention for its structural and political problems. Also, unlike the aforementioned studies, the empirical analysis that follows relies on audit-based data, instead of data on legal rents (Svaleryd and Vlachos, 2009), scandals (Nyblade and Reed, 2008) and prosecution of politicians (Golden and Chang, 2001). A common problem in measuring corruption is that the investigation and divulgence of political scandals may be politically motivated. As a result, such proxies for corruption are influenced by the intensity of the electoral competition and the political targeting that comes with it. As an anonymous referee pointed out, the fact that the cancelation of expenses rarely has any further legal consequences means that it is highly unlikely for this measure to be biased by political targeting.====The fundamental identification problem for the main empirical question of this study is the simultaneous causality between the competitiveness of the local elections and the corruption that is observed in the subsequent term. The voters may have received some signals about the quality of the candidates, and this knowledge can shape their voting decisions. Therefore, it is likely that the mayors who are elected easily are the mayors who are expected to manage public money well. To overcome the identification problem, I exploit the partisan nature of local elections in Greece and use the competitiveness of the municipalities in the national elections to instrument for their competitiveness in the local elections. Local election tickets tend to be organized along partisan lines, and voters most often choose the ticket that is affiliated with the national party they generally support. As a result, the municipalities that are competitive in national elections tend to also be competitive in the local elections. Voting in the national elections is mostly based on ideology and on the perceived quality of the parties' high-ranking political figures. Therefore, it is unlikely that the quality of the local government significantly affects the partisan preferences of the voters and the municipality's competitiveness in the national elections.====In order to measure the competitiveness of the local elections, I construct an index that is equal to one minus the Herfindahl index of the vote fractions that different tickets received in the first round of the local elections. Similarly, I measure the competitiveness of the municipality in the national elections with an index that is equal to one minus the Herfindahl Index of the vote fractions that different parties received in the municipality in the national elections of 2000. The Herfindahl index has been used to measure party concentration and competition in various studies, such as De Paola and Scoppa (2011), Sorensen (2014), and Alfano and Baraldi (2016). The advantage of this measure is that it captures various aspects of competitiveness, such as the size of the majority, the distance between the first two parties, and the presence of strong third and fourth candidates. A common alternative measure is the margin of victory, but it fails to account for the presence of other candidates and is thus unsuitable for the analysis of this particular political setting. Because it has been shown that various commonly used measures of competitiveness can produce different outcomes (Dash et al., 2018), I provide in the online appendix an array of robustness tests where different measures of competitiveness are used without changing the main results.====In OLS regressions, the local election competitiveness is not significantly associated with corruption. The IV results, though, suggest a strong effect of competitiveness on corruption: when controlling for the size of the municipality, urban status, and education, an increase in local election competitiveness by one standard deviation is associated with a statistically significant reduction in corruption by 31%. As suggested by an anonymous referee, an important implication of the results is that the scope of corruption depends on the utility loss that voters suffer from switching parties. If the utility loss is large, and if the distribution of partisan preferences in a region is unbalanced, then elections are less competitive and the management of government is of lower quality.",Electoral competition and corruption: Evidence from municipality audits in Greece,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818302990,2 May 2019,2019,Research Article,189.0

Many argue that the absence of formal public institutions to establish and enforce property rights necessarily leads to conflict and violent private enforcement of property rights. By re-examining the decision problem of the “early entrants” into the property market, we argue that the mitigation of violent conflict begins when the property is first claimed though the claimants’ anticipation of the likelihood that their ownership will be challenged in the future. We perform a large-scale empirical test of the implications of this model (and of similar papers) by looking at the effect of the Homestead Acts—an exogenous increase in publicly assigned, but privately enforced, property rights—on the occurrence of violence on the American frontier. Exploiting variations in the assignment of homestead grants across states and time, we find that increases in homestead claims cause a statistically significant but economically insignificant increase in homicides. We conclude that there is no evidence that the assignment of privately enforced property rights meaningfully increases violence, and that settlers of the American West, as a whole, behaved in a manner consistent with rational conflict avoidance.","What would happen in the absence of government? In the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes predicted, among other things, that individual efforts to protect property would lead to disorder, chaos, and ultimately violence (Hobbes, 1996)—violence that carries significant costs (Smith et al., 2014). However, there is a fascinating body of research that casts doubt into the Hobbesian prediction of chaos and violence in the absence of government (Dixit, 2007, Umbeck, 1977a, Umbeck, 1977b, Powell and Wilson, 2008, Leeson, 2013, Powell and Stringham, 2009). Given the current institutionalized state of the world, most of this literature relies on historical accounts or lab experiments to make the claim that individuals are able to cooperate in the absence of a formal institution without killing each other to resolve disputes. Even in the most seemingly improbable of situations, groups at odds with each other have found ways to cooperate without formal public institutional intervention (Leeson, 2009). Many, however, still hold firm to the notion that public institutions are the only way to enforce contracts. In this paper, we explore the relationship between property rights and violent conflict with new theoretical and empirical arguments.====An emerging issue in modern society, as sort of a Hobbesian offshoot, is the establishment of property rights by a public institution with little or no public enforcement of those rights. Most obviously, this has been observed to be the case in the least-developed areas of the world where officially governments exist, but practically they do little to enforce property rights (Leeson, 2007b, Leeson and Williamson, 2009). Similar arguments have been made, some even recently (Sessions, 2017), that extra-legal enforcement necessarily requires violence (Owens, 2011). This may quickly become the case in some US communities where evidence of distrust in law enforcement—those primarily tasked with enforcing property rights—is growing.====For instance, there is a long history of distrust in law enforcement in some communities==== that ultimately stems from a lack a property rights enforcement. In an effort to save money, or as a misguided use of the data, some cities have begun programs that limit the degree to which police officers respond to 911 calls particularly those that involve property crimes (Dardick and Gorner, 2013, Kostanich, 2016). Even if police do respond to calls but respond slowly, if time is any factor at all, a slow response serves the same as not responding at all and creates the same lack of public property rights enforcement.==== . In other cities, officers have been instructed to not respond to home invasion calls or engage in anything that may lead to high speed pursuits (Luthern and Spicuzza, 2017). In all of these instances, the government has established the property right, but the local enforcers of that right have either completely opted out of enforcement, or at best only weakly enforce those rights. If we extend this line of thinking to include civil liberties as property rights, much of the Black Lives Matters movement is based on established rights by the government that many feel are not being properly enforced. What was initially a problem created by the distance and isolation of a rural setting is increasingly becoming an issue to urban environments.====So while we may look to pirates (Leeson, 2007a), diamonds (Bernstein, 1992) and prisons (Skarbek, 2012) to address how formal cooperation exists to establish extralegal property rights in the absence of an overarching public institution, what should we expect to occur in the more modernly relevant scenario of the publicly assigned but not enforced property right? To answer this question, we propose a model of endogenous property choice. By re-examining the decision problem of the “early entrants” into the property market, we argue that the mitigation of violent conflict begins when the property is first claimed though the claimants’ anticipation of the likelihood that their ownership will be challenged in the future—that is, an anticipation of a lack of public enforcement of their property rights. Previous studies have focused on the details surrounding the formation, behavior and rules enforcement of privately formed institutions. Here, we abstract away from the mechanisms of how and when formal private institutions form and take them as given based on the plethora of public choice literature suggesting that in some instances they do form. The cost associated with our approach is that we are not able to point to a specific rule, agreement or pact that allows land owners to privately enforce property rights.==== The benefit, however, is that we are able to essentially average the effects of private enforcement of property rights from across the country using a large-scale observational empirical test of the implications of our model by looking at the effect of the Homestead Acts—an increase in assigned, but not publicly enforced, property rights—on the occurrence of violence on the American frontier. Exploiting variations in the assignment of homestead grants across states and across time, we find that the increase in homicides due to increases in homestead land grants is small enough to be considered a precisely estimated zero. We conclude that there is no evidence that the assignment of privately enforced property rights meaningfully increases violence, and that settlers of the American West, as a whole, behaved in a manner consistent with rational conflict avoidance.",?

Because laws restricting voting by felons and ex-felons disproportionately affect minorities, and minorities tend to vote for Democratic candidates, it has been hypothesized that felony disenfranchisement hurts Democratic candidates in elections, thus helping Republican candidates. We test this hypothesis using variation in felony disenfranchisement laws across U.S. states and over time. During the 2000s, a number of states restored the voting rights of ex-felons. Using difference-in-differences regressions, we estimate the effect of laws re-enfranchising ex-felons on the vote shares of major party candidates in elections for seats to the U.S. House of Representatives. We argue that the regression estimates provide an upper bound for the true effect of restoring voting rights to ex-felons on the vote shares of major party candidates. Using this upper bound, no House majority would have been reversed in any year between 1998 and 2012, had all states allowed ex-felons to vote.","A felony conviction in the United States usually implies a loss of voting rights. At present, 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia prohibit voting while incarcerated for a felony offense; 35 states prohibit persons on parole or probation from voting; and twelve states impose voting restrictions on at least some categories of ex-offenders who have completed their sentence. We investigate the hypothesis that excluding felons from the right to vote changes the outcomes of national elections.====This hypothesis is motivated by two observations. First, while felony disenfranchisement laws affect approximately one in forty American adults, they disproportionately restrict voting by racial minorities. For example, approximately one in every thirteen black adults in the U.S. currently cannot vote as the result of a felony conviction, and in three states (Florida, Kentucky, and Virginia) more than one in five black adults is disenfranchised.==== Second, since the 1970s minorities have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in national elections. For example, at least 83% of African-Americans voters voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1976, while no Democratic presidential candidate was able to attract more than 48% of the white vote in any election during that period.==== Based on these facts, it may seem reasonable to conjecture that felony voting restrictions hurt Democrats at the polls, and help Republicans.====The problem with this conjecture, however, is that it relies on two unproven assumptions: First, that disenfranchised felons, if given the right to vote, would turn out to vote in large enough numbers to affect election outcomes. Second, that conditional on voting, a felon's decision of who to vote for is similar to the choice made by a non-felon of the same race. In an influential paper, Uggen and Manza (2002) examined whether U.S. national elections between 1978 and 2000 would have produced different winners if all disenfranchised felons had been allowed to vote, under the assumption that the counterfactual turnout and voting decisions of disenfranchised felons would have been the same as the decisions of registered voters with the same socio-demographic characteristics (which were predicted from voter surveys using regression analysis).==== They estimated that removing felony voting restrictions in the United States would have increased the number of Democrats elected to the U.S. Senate in every election between 1978 and 2000, and that “if disenfranchised felons in Florida had been permitted to vote [in the 2000 presidential election], Democrat Gore would certainly have carried the state, and the election” (p. 792).====A number of authors have since questioned these estimates and the assumptions on which they are based. Miles (2004) compared the turnout rates (estimated from voter surveys) of African-American males—the group most likely to be convicted of a felony—to those of whites and females, in states that barred ex-felons from voting and in states that did not. He found no statistically significant effect of post-sentence voting restrictions on the turnout rate of black males during the period 1986–2000, suggesting that these restrictions were likely not binding for affected individuals. Haselswerdt (2009) arrived at a similar conclusion, finding that, in a sample of 660 New York ex-felons, only 5 percent voted in the 2004 elections. However, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, Hjalmarsson and Lopez (2010) estimated that 26 percent of ever-incarcerated persons voted in the 2004 elections. Similarly, by matching offender records with voter registration files in five states, Burch (2011) estimated that 22% of ex-felons voted in the 2008 elections.==== Although these estimates differ from one another substantially, they are all well below the turnout rates in the general voting-eligible population,==== which suggests that the impact of felony voting restrictions on election outcomes might be more limited than the effect computed by Uggen and Manza (2002).====Our analysis follows a more direct strategy to estimate the effect of felony voting restrictions on election outcomes. We utilize a wave of actual policy changes that affected felon voting rights in a number of U.S. states between 1998 and 2012. During this period, several states tightened their voting restrictions, but many others relaxed them. For example, the most severe restriction—a lifelong ban from voting following a felony conviction—was imposed by ten U.S. states at the beginning of our sample. By 2005, this number had fallen to two states, before rising again to three in 2011. The resulting variation in the scope and severity of felony disenfranchisement laws, over time and across jurisdictions, offers an opportunity to estimate the effect of these laws on the outcomes of national elections without having to make assumptions about turnout rates by previously disenfranchised individuals. As most changes in disenfranchisement laws in the 1990s and 2000s concerned the voting rights of ex-felons (as opposed to those in prison, on probation, or on parole), we focus on post-sentence voting restrictions only. Post-sentence restrictions account for approximately four out of five disenfranchised individuals in states that impose them. We estimate the impact of removing these restrictions on the outcomes of elections for seats in the U.S. House of Representative between 1998 and 2012, as well as on voter turnout rates.====We find that allowing ex-felons to vote increases the vote share of Democratic candidates in House elections. When plausibly exogenous controls for the number of candidates and the presence of an incumbent in election races are included in the regressions, the estimated marginal effects range from a 0.17 percentage points increase in Democratic vote share associated with laws that restored the voting rights of some ex-felons, to a 1.56 percentage points increase associated with laws that restored the voting rights of all ex-felons. In addition, we find that the turnout rate of black males increases by several percentage points in states that allow their ex-felons to vote, as does the difference between the turnout rates of blacks and whites. The direction of these estimates is consistent with the narrative that felony disenfranchisement laws disproportionately restrict voting by racial minorities, and that removing these restrictions increases the vote share of Democratic candidates. However, none of these estimates are statistically significant. Thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that felony disenfranchisement has no effect on either turnout or vote shares.====We then test if the estimated vote share effects, despite not being statistically significant, are, in principle, consistent with previous estimates of the number of disenfranchised ex-felons and the turnout and voting patterns of ex-felons who had their voting rights restored. We show that our regression results imply values for these structural parameters that exceed all but the largest existing estimates, and generally require an implausibly large number of disenfranchised ex-felons, or implausibly high rates at which ex-felons turn out to vote, and vote for Democrats. We emphasize that our dataset includes ==== election race for U.S. House of Representatives that occurred over a 14-year period, and covers ==== change in state felony disenfranchisement laws. However, given the limited number of states that changed their ex-felon voting restrictions, the fact that only 435 congressional elections take place every two years, and that many other factors (some of which we control for) influence election outcomes, any remotely plausible effect of ex-felon voting bans on vote shares is too small to yield regression estimates that are significantly different from zero in the election data. For this reason, our regression estimates should be interpreted as upper bounds on the true size of the effect of felony disenfranchisement laws in House elections between 1998 and 2012.====An effect equal to our largest point estimate would have resulted in Democrats winning between zero and three additional seats in House elections over our study period, had ex-felons been allowed to vote in all states—gains that would not have been sufficient to change the majority from Republican to Democrat in any year in which Republicans held a House majority. Thus, even if felony disenfranchisement affects the turnout rates of minorities and the vote shares of Democratic candidates, its impact is likely too small to affect aggregate political outcomes in the context of elections to the U.S. House of Representatives. When we repeat this exercise using the upper 95% confidence bound of the estimate, the 1998 and 2000 elections would have resulted in a slim Democratic majority in the House of Representatives if all ex-felons had been allowed to vote. However, no majorities since then would have changed. The congressional districts that elected Republicans, but would have elected Democrats in these counterfactual scenarios, are frequently in Kentucky, Virginia, and Florida—the three states that bar the most ex-felons from voting. However, these districts, on average, do not have disproportionately large minority populations—if anything, they are slightly “whiter” than the national average.====Overall, our results reinforce the skepticism regarding the aggregate consequences of felon voting that emerged from previous studies. This conclusion does not mean that the reform of felony disenfranchisement laws is unimportant on the individual level. Voting in elections is a fundamental form of civic participation in democracies and, therefore, a potentially valuable component in the rehabilitation and reintegration process for at least some ex-felons. Our finding that voting rights restoration has few, if any, tangible effects on election outcomes reduces one potential political obstacle from continuing the voting rights reforms we study in this paper.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we review changes in felony disenfranchisement laws that were enacted in several states between 1998 and 2012. In Section 3 we describe our dataset. In Section 4 we develop our empirical approach, which consists of a basic difference-in-differences regression framework to estimate the effect of felon voting rights on vote shares and turnout rates, and a set of “calibration tests” that we use to assess the plausibility of the regression estimates. In Section 5 we present the results of both. In Section 6 we use our regression results to compute counterfactual election outcomes, had all states allowed all ex-felons to vote. Section 7 concludes.

The reason is that there are two countervailing effects at play. On the one hand, larger damage awards lead to increased litigation expenditures, which have a dampening effect on optimal damages. On the other hand, variable litigation costs only make sense if the parties anticipate a gain from expending litigation effort, which necessarily translates into a probability of plaintiff victory that is less than one. Consequently, the deterrence function of the trial is mitigated, justifying an upward adjustment in the optimal damage award. The optimal adjustment balances these two effects.","The economic theory of tort law is based on the premise that liability for accidents forces individuals who are engaged in risky activities to internalize the harm that their actions impose on others. In this way, liability acts like a Pigovian tax. The liability system, however, is a costly means of achieving this goal, as was first pointed out by Shavell (1982). Litigation costs interfere with the goal of risk internalization in two ways: first, they discourage some victims from filing suit, and second, for those cases that are filed, injurers do not account for the trial costs of victims. As a result, injurers are underdeterred relative to a zero-litigation-cost world. The use of a costly liability system to internalize harm is therefore socially desirable only if the deterrence benefits outweigh the costs of operating it.====In light of this conclusion, several authors have examined whether the liability system can be made more efficient by allowing courts to adjust the amount of damages injurers are required to pay. Polinsky and Rubinfeld (1988) first showed that, compared to pure compensatory damages, the optimal adjustment may be positive or negative. Hylton (2002) extended the Polinsky and Rubinfeld results by showing that the optimal liability award under strict liability either equals the sum of the victim’s damages and litigation costs, or some lesser amount, depending on the productivity of injurer care. Most recently, Polinsky and Shavell (2014) showed that when plaintiffs and defendants have variable litigation costs—i.e., costs that increase with the damage award— optimal damages are always strictly less than the sum of the victim’s harm and litigation costs (assuming lawsuits are desirable at all). The reason is that there is now an additional cost of raising damages at the margin, which must be balanced against the deterrence benefits of any upward adjustment in liability.====This note contributes to this line of literature by showing that the Polinsky and Shavell result does not hold up if account is taken of the reason why litigation costs increase with the damage award. We specifically focus on a model of litigation along the lines of Katz (1988) in which litigants spend more on litigation as the stakes of the case increase.==== In that context, we show that the adjustment to liability may be larger or smaller than plaintiffs’ total litigation costs. The reason is that in conflict models of this sort, the trial becomes a rent-seeking game in which the plaintiff and defendant fight over the assignment of responsibility for the victim’s loss. Thus, the parties expend resources at trial in hopes of obtaining a more favorable ruling from the court: the plaintiff seeks a larger expected judgment and the defendant seeks a smaller one.==== It is indeed true that in this context, the Nash-equilibrium levels of expenditure by the parties are increasing in the expected judgment, but it is also true that the plaintiff’s expected win rate is generally less than one, for otherwise the defendant would not have invested in the case.====It is this less-than-certain plaintiff win rate that counteracts the result in Polinsky and Shavell (2014). Whereas they showed that variable litigation costs reduce the adjustment of damages because of the increase in litigation costs as damages rise, the possibility that the defendant will “win” the case, and hence will avoid some liability, mitigates the deterrence function of the trial, thus justifying an upward adjustment in the optimal damage award.

(NEJM, 2016). We examine to what extent a physician who has past paid medical malpractice (“med mal”) claims in a defined prior period is more likely to have additional paid claims in a defined future period, relative to a physician with no prior-period claims. Our simulation implements a null hypothesis that paid claims are random events, with arrival risk depending on state, but not on physician-specific factors (such as technical ability, bedside manner, and communication skills). We show that even a single paid claim in the prior five years nearly quadruples the likelihood of a paid claim in the next five years, and dramatically increases the likelihood of 2+ future paid claims. More generally, the number of prior paid claims strongly predicts both the likelihood of having future paid claims and the expected number of future claims. By comparing actual to simulated probabilities, we can predict the likelihood that having a given number of paid claims is attributable to chance. We find that even for physicians in high-risk specialties in high-risk states, bad luck is highly unlikely to explain three or more claims in 5 years. Hospitals and state medical boards can use our approach to identify physicians that are likely to benefit from graduated interventions aimed at reducing future claims and patient harm.","It has long been known that some physicians are prone to repeat medical malpractice (“med mal”) claims.==== But how much more claim prone are they? What fraction of paid med mal claims are due to physicians with multiple paid claims? At what point (what number of paid claims, over what period) can we fairly call these physicians “outliers” -- or less politely, apparent “bad docs” -- and take steps to reduce future medical errors and paid claims? We study these questions using national data on paid claims from the National Practitioner Data Bank (“NPDB”). We compare the actual and simulated probabilities that a physician in state ====, with ==== paid medical malpractice claims in a prior ==== year-period will have ==== or more paid claims in the next ==== years. Our simulation compares actual paid claim arrival patterns to a simple null hypothesis that claims are random events, with arrival risk depending on state and specialty, but not on physician “skill” – a concept we use broadly, to refer to technical skill and other physician-specific factors such as communication skills, bedside manner, and whether the physician tends to see high-risk patients. This null hypothesis reflects the belief of many physicians that most malpractice suits are indeed random events – attributable to bad luck, rather than actual negligence (Below, we often omit “paid,” but all references to claims are to paid claims reported to NPDB.)====Our study extends Studdert et al. ==== (New England Journal of Medicine, 2016). Using NPDB data, Studdert and coauthors conclude that only about 6% of practicing physicians had one or more claims over a 10-year period from 2005 to 2014, and that the 1% of physicians with 2+ claims during this period accounted for 32% of paid claims. Studdert and coauthors also report that the number of claims in an initial five-year period strongly predicts the likelihood of a claim in the next five years: the more prior-period claims, the higher the likelihood of a future claim. See our Fig. 1 (which is a copy of their Fig. 2A). The implication is that a physician’s past claim history, plus the physician’s practice state, specialty, and perhaps some basic demographic information, goes a long way toward predicting the physician’s future claim history. Weycker and Jensen (1990), in an earlier study of Michigan physicians in the 1980s, also find that claims in a prior 5-year period strongly predict claims in a future 5-year period, controlling for a broad set of physician characteristics.====We extend Studdert et al.’s analysis by adding an explicit null hypothesis, which allows us to differentiate physicians who may have just been “unlucky” from “outliers” who are actually (not just statistically, based on averages for a broad group) much more likely to experience additional future claims. Our null hypothesis is that paid med mal claims are random events that convey no information about physician quality and future claim risk. This view (that med mal claims are largely random events) is popular among physicians and tort reform advocates. If claims arrive at random, many physicians would have zero paid claims, a fair number would have one paid claim, a smaller number would have two paid claims, and so on. However, it is well known that malpractice risk varies across states and specialties. The fraction of physicians who would have multiple paid claims under the null hypothesis should therefore vary across states and specialties – so that the same number of paid claims in a specified time period could indicate an outlier physician in some states and specialties, but perhaps only an unlucky physician in other states and specialties.====If we are able to identify a threshold number of paid claims over a specified period at which it is no longer plausible that a physician was unlucky, our approach can be used to identify physicians who deserve closer scrutiny by hospitals and licensing boards. To be sure, multiple factors influence whether a physician is sued for malpractice, and whether a payout actually results. However, as Studdert and coauthors report in an important prior paper (Studdert et al., 2006), there is a strong association between paid claims and negligent treatment. Thus, it may be possible to reduce the incidence of medical error by focusing hospital and medical board attention on outlier physicians.====For our principal study period of 2006–2015, even a single paid claim in the first five years nearly quadruples the likelihood of a paid claim in the next five years relative to physicians with no claims during this period – from 3.8% to 12.4%. A single prior paid claim increases the likelihood of 2+ future paid claims six-fold relative to physicians with no prior claims -- from 0.4% to 2.4%. More generally, the number of prior paid claims over any prior ====-year period (we study periods from 3 to 10 years) strongly predicts both the likelihood of having 1+ claims over the next z years, as well as the number of future claims.====Previous research has sought to identify factors that predict future med mal claims, but has often considered factors which we take as part of our base simulation (risk varies by state) or found predictive value in factors which could be hard to use as the basis for intervention, such as age or gender.==== We are interested in a different question: to what extent, after we take account of state-level variation, can we identify physicians who have experienced certain claiming patterns as true outliers? And how strongly can we do so, for any given claiming pattern? Our goal is to identify claiming patterns which can support intervention by hospitals, practice groups, or medical boards to reduce future claims and patient harm. For that purpose, it is not helpful to know that being, say, a neurosurgeon in New York, predicts both a relatively high rate of malpractice claims and high damage awards in paid claims, or that being male predicts, say, a 30% higher claim rate than being female. No one thinks that we should ban neurosurgery in New York, or bar men from entering high-risk specialties. Given that, we seek to identify which physicians are outliers compared to their peers – raising the possibility of intervention to reduce future claims and harm.====Some physicians are surely just unlucky, but our evidence -- that even a single prior claim strongly predicts future claims -- suggests that many claims reflect physicians having “negative skill” relative to an average of their peers. The likelihood that bad luck can generate two claims over a 5-year period is quite low (save perhaps for high-risk specialties in high-risk states). The likelihood that bad luck can lead to 3+ claims over a 5-year period is negligible. However, we also find evidence that the far past is a worse predictor of future claims than the near past. Thus, for example, one prior claim, 11–15 years ago, has less predictive value than a claim between 6–10 years ago, which has less predictive value than a claim in the last 5 years.====Part II discusses our data sources and variables. Part III develops a simple model of the malpractice risk faced by low- and high-skill physicians, and presents our simulation methodology.

I find no evidence of biases against developing states using the same datasets and estimation strategies as the original studies. I find similar results when using alternative estimation strategies in the replication. However, when I change to a larger and more up-to-date dataset in the extension, I start to find consistent negative correlations between respondent states’ development status and their likelihood of losing. The results remain robust after I take into account confounding factors that could be correlated with unobserved case strength, and use the Heckman probit selection model to correct for potential selection bias caused by settlement. The patterns indicate that there may exist biases against developing states in investment treaty arbitration.","In recent years, developing countries like Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela have announced their withdrawal from the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”).==== The ICSID Convention allows private investors to directly bring claims against host states for alleged violations of obligations under international investment agreements (IIAs) through arbitration. This investment treaty arbitration system has been characterized as a powerful sword in the hands of rich developed states against poor developing states (Schultz and Dupont, 2014; Trakman, 2013). In particular, foreign investors are allegedly more successful when litigating against developing states than developed states (Behn et al., 2017). Due to this perception of bias, there is a backlash in the developing world against the investment treaty arbitration system. Not only have a few developing states withdrawn from the ICSID Convention, other developing states like India and Indonesia have terminated their Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) in reaction to continuous losses in investment treaty arbitration.====Is the investment treaty arbitration system biased against developing states? A few studies have examined this issue from various perspectives but arrived at inconsistent conclusions (see Franck, 2009; Van Harten, 2012; Van Harten, 2016; Franck, 2014; Schultz and Dupont, 2014; Strezhnev, 2017; Behn et al., 2017). These studies have been frequently relied on as evidence to vindicate each side’s arguments in the debate about whether to reform the current system.==== Yet, these studies have often been questioned for dataset and methodology limitations, which is especially concerning given the far-reaching policy impacts they have. Thus, it is important and necessary to replicate these studies to assess their credibility and evaluate the validity of corresponding policy proposals.====I select two widely-cited empirical studies whose results lead to contradictory implications: Susan Franck’s ==== (2009) and Gus Van Harten’s ==== (2012).==== These two studies provide valuable sources for replication studies because they are both influential in the field of international investment arbitration and controversial in terms of their methodologies and results. They have been considered as representative empirical works in investment treaty arbitration.==== They have also been cited in policy reports by national government and international research institutes.==== Meanwhile, these two studies have also been questioned because of the small size of datasets they used (Kidane, 2017), the lack of control for case merits (Rogers, 2013), and the failure to consider other measures of bias against developing countries (Gallagher and Shrestha, 2011). Notably, the necessity of future replication studies has been acknowledged by authors of the original studies themselves.====In this paper, I first attempt to reproduce the results in these two studies. To do so, I attempt to gather the original data used for the studies (the “reproduction datasets”) and identify the original estimation specifications used in the studies.==== I then focus on a common question examined by both studies: whether investment treaty arbitration is biased against developing respondent states. On this question, both studies have found null results. I replicate and extend the original studies in the following way: (1) using the two reproduction datasets, I use alternative estimation strategies to examine the common question; (2) using a more up-to-date and comprehensive dataset, I reexamine the common question, taking into account different confounding factors.====A major confounding factor is potential differences in case strength between cases against developing states and cases against developed states. It is difficult to draw meaningful inferences about biases against developing states from case outcomes alone without considering case merits. On the legal side, it is possible that investors win more cases against developing states because developing states tend to commit to broader obligations in the IIAs they signed (Poulsen and Aisbett, 2013). On the factual side, it is possible that developing states have poorer governance and thus are more likely to violate their IIA obligations (Behn et al., 2017). It is also possible that developed states are better at filtering out stronger cases of investors at the settlement stage and thereby the cases that result in final awards against developed states are weaker and consequently have higher state win rates (Strezhnev, 2017).====In the extension, I take two steps to address this issue. First, I add controls that account for the restrictiveness of the underlying IIA and the respondent state’s governance quality, which could be correlated with unobserved case strength. Second, I use the Heckman probit selection model to correct for potential selection bias caused by settlement. I find that more developed respondent states are significantly less likely to lose in investment treaty arbitration cases than less developed respondent states. The results remain robust after adding different controls and using the Heckman probit selection model.====The contributions of this paper are threefold: First, by reproducing Franck (2009) and Van Harten (2012) this paper validates some results and finds different results in the reproduction of the others. Second, by replicating Franck (2009) and Van Harten (2012) using the original datasets, this paper checks the robustness of the original findings to alternative estimation strategies. Finally, by extending Franck (2009) and Van Harten (2012) using a more up-to-date and comprehensive dataset, this paper takes into account potential confounds that could affect unobserved case strength. This paper identifies consistent negative correlations between respondent states’ development status and their likelihood of losing, indicating potential biases against developing respondent states in investment treaty arbitration.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Part II briefly introduces the two original studies; Part III describes the three datasets used in this paper; Part IV reproduces major results in the two original studies; Part V replicates and extends the two original studies, using alternative estimation strategies and the expanded dataset; Part VI concludes.",Development status and decision-making in investment treaty arbitration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818302436,1 April 2019,2019,Research Article,194.0

This paper attempts to fill this gap by analyzing the impact of judicial review on the application of market analysis in competition investigations by the Russian competition authority during 2008–2015. Although the guidelines for the assessment of competition are mandatory for many types of anticompetitive conducts and they require application of the Hypothetical Monopolist Test to delineate antitrust market, competition authority does not always do that. We test hypotheses on the impact of legal requirements, experience of application, and the outcomes of the judicial review on the probability to present either an informal market analysis or market delineation using the Hypothetical Monopolist Test in a particular decision. We find that positive outcomes of the judicial review of infringement decisions significantly increase the probability of undertaking a particular analysis in future investigations. The pressure of judicial review under the presence of mandatory standards of evidence is an important determinant of the development of evidentiary standards in competition law.","An effective appeals process as an error-corrections mechanism (Shavell, 1995, Shavell, 2006) is a necessary condition for the quality of law enforcement. For decisions finding legal violations, appealing allows the probability of wrongful convictions (Type I errors) to be reduced. Another important effect of appealing is that it affects the standards of evidence: decisions of higher courts influence future courses of action in lower instances and by regulatory bodies.====Both effects – avoiding wrongful convictions and developing standards of evidence – are important when a law is enforced by executives in public agencies rather than by courts. One important example is antitrust (or competition, in European traditions) legislation. In the administrative model of antitrust enforcement (Jenny, 2016) that quantitatively prevails throughout the world – from the US Federal Trade Commission to Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation – decisions on whether wrongdoing takes place are made by specialized public servants. Typically, investigation, prosecution and adjudication are made within the same agency and, sometimes, by the same group of officers. According to many experts (Wils, 2004), prosecutorial bias in this system is inevitable for a number of reasons.====In competition enforcement, prosecutorial bias is socially harmful, among other reasons, because wrongful convictions result from mistakes of act instead of mistakes of identity (Garoupa and Rizzolli, 2012). Effects from the mistakes of act are long-term (Easterbrook, 1984).====If a law is enforced on the basis of the administrative model, decisions of public agencies are subject to judicial review, which is supposed to provide incentives for state agencies to act efficiently (Dari-Mattiacci et al., 2010). However, there is skepticism about the ability of judges to effectively prevent wrongful convictions and contribute to the standards of evidence due to a lack of professional skills and knowledge. Competition enforcement is probably one of the best examples of why this skepticism arises. Models that underlie theories of harm and efficiency defense become increasingly complicated over time; their interpretation in a particular case and external assessments of this interpretation under judicial review present considerable difficulties.====Empirical evidence on the quality of judicial decisions on competition cases is mixed. Baye and Wright (2011) prove that specialized training of judges in generalist courts contributes to the legal quality of decisions. One year later, analyzing the outcomes of external judicial review and the quality of administrative decisions in the US FTC, the same authors were unable to find any evidence to confirm the effect (Wright and Diveley, 2012). Nevertheless, there is a consensus that the main advantage of the administrative vs. prosecutorial model of competition enforcement is the higher professional skills of specialized officers (Jenny, 2016). In the EU, legal scholars doubt that courts are able to analyze complex economic and technical issues in antitrust cases (Laguna de Paz, 2014). There is also skepticism about the ability of courts in the EU system to improve the normative standards of competition enforcement (Geradin and Petit, 2011).====Theoretical modeling does not provide a unanimous answer on the effects of judicial review of competition decisions. Judicial review of competition authority (CA hereafter) decisions may be superior to internal mechanisms of error correction, but only under a number of assumptions. Moreover, judicial review may not incentivize the authorities to use proper legal standards (Katsoulacos and Ulph, 2011). At the same time, the model of the choice of legal standards by CA developed in Katsoulacos (2019a) suggests that a rational agency influenced by reputational concerns is not necessarily incentivized to use advanced economic analysis when investigating a case.====Our research is devoted to the ability of judicial review to contribute to the development of the standards of evidence in competition law enforcement. In contrast to many other papers, we address this question empirically. The research question concerns whether the outcomes of judicial review affect the decision of CA to apply the Hypothetical Monopolist Test (HMT, or Small but Significant and Non-Transitory Price Increase, SSNIP) and provide a relatively extensive analysis of market competition under investigation of competition law violation. The goal of this paper is to test whether judicial review in the administrative competition enforcement system affects the approach to economic analysis that CAs use if procedural rules contain requirements for economic analysis to prove violations and if judges take them into account when reviewing infringement decisions.====We provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis on the role of judicial review as being a driving force for the development of evidentiary standards. The Russian competition jurisdiction is the focus of our analysis. It is relatively young, thus the probability of a wrongful conviction is considered to be high (Girgenson and Numerova, 2012), including due to self-incrimination (Pavlova and Shastitko, 2016). Judicial review by non-specialized judges promotes the use of specific instruments of market analysis due to the legal requirements for infringement decisions, which establishes a certain level of economic analysis.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The next section contains a brief literature review. Section 3 presents the model that allows us to empirically derive testable propositions on the determinants of evidentiary standards under administrative enforcement. Section 4 is devoted to the Russian context of judicial review of administrative decisions made by the CA and guidelines for competition investigations. Section 5 explains the empirical modeling approach and discusses the results of the empirical analysis.

These two effects, asymmetric ability and asymmetric reimbursement, independently create different favorites and underdogs. Acknowledging these two asymmetries, our research (1) clarifies the favorite/underdog blur under three timing assumptions; (2) shows that with endogenous timing, the plaintiff moves first whether they are favorite or underdog; (3) finds that asymmetric fee-shifting provisions, conceived to favor prevailing plaintiffs, can disincentivize plaintiffs from suing by making them worse-off than under the American rule; and (4) shows that the efficient outcome may never be reached, even with endogenous timing. The compounding effects of prize asymmetry are analyzed.","In the United States, when a government agency fails to stop a firm from polluting illegally, citizens can step up by acting as federal attorneys general and prosecute. If citizens succeed, an exception to the American rule allows them to recover attorneys’ fees. These fee-shifting provisions it ==== were introduced to incentivize citizens to privately advance the goals of environmental legislation. However, other litigation features may give the polluting firm an advantage ====: the plaintif’s burden of proof in environmental citizen suits, the firm's access to specialized legal assistance or asymmetric information regarding the firm's activities. Asymmetric reimbursement helps citizens while asymmetric ability helps the firm.====In this article, we investigate the effect of asymmetric ability, asymmetric reimbursement and timing – the sequence of events leading to a trial – on the citizens’ incentives to sue. We analyze the extent to which asymmetric reimbursement tilts the odds of winning toward the citizens. We also look at the economic efficiency of citizen suits by studying the total effort expended in trials.====To study these issues, we model trials as Tullock contests and analyze the levels of effort expended by each player. Each litigant's expected payoff from trial will define each’s incentive to sue, and it serve as each’s threat-point in settlement negotiations. Different interpretations of the sequence of events in litigation yield three different subgames. For each subgame, we study the impacts on the litigants’ incentives to go to trial and their odds of winning the trial, thereby yielding a contest favorite and an underdog.====When litigants compete ====, asymmetric reimbursement does its job at incentivizing citizens to sue since with their participation constraint (PC) is never violated. When reimbursement of attorneys’ fees is high, the firm has a strong incentive to avoid trial as its expected profits would be negative (PC violation), although a high enough ability helps the firm escape this outcome. When citizens are the contest leader, they internalize the firm's advantage in ability. While the citizens expected payoff is always positive, the firm's PC can be violated, which would tend to favor the citizens in settlement. When the firm leads, we find a corner solution in which the citizens are driven out of the trial by the firm. In this setup, the citizens are almost always the underdog. Counterintuitively, the firm internalizes high asymmetric reimbursement and turns it to its advantage: the higher the firm's ability, the greater its incentive to increase trial effort. This triggers a decrease in the effort expended by the citizens. In this setup, citizens are harmed by asymmetric fee-shifting provisions and would be better off with the American rule.====We also find that the efficient outcome is not always reached when citizens lead. When allowing for strategic behavior (endogenous timing), the citizens always lead and the firm always follows. In constrast to Dixit (1987) and Baik and Shogren (1992) and Baik and Shogren (1994), the singularity of this last outcome is twofold. ====, it occurs regardless of whether the citizens’ group is a favorite or underdog. This outcome contrasts with single-asymmetry cases in which the favorite always chooses to follow and the underdog chooses to lead. ====, the outcome associated with endogenous timing is not always efficient. An efficient outcome depends on the relative magnitude of ability and reimbursement. To a certain extent, whether the institutional framework makes endogenous timing likely or not is irrelevant, as efficiency may or may not be reached anyways.",Strategic behavior in environmental contests with asymmetric ability and reimbursement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818301261,23 March 2019,2019,Research Article,196.0

The progressive implementation of the NCCP allowed us to (1) use differences-in-differences (to control for the effect of time invariant characteristics) with matching estimator (to control for bias selection), and (2) to differentiate the impact based on whether the NCCP was earlier (2010) or later (2012) implemented. A large sample was used (N = 445,838). The impact of NCCP was evaluated on aggregated and individual measures of crime and perceived risk of crime, including violent crime. Results show that the impact of the NCCP on crime was low and lost strength every year. Moreover, the impact is selective (it only affects some forms of crime) and differentiated (it reduces some forms of crime while increasing others). It also reduces the most common forms of crime committed with arms. On the other hand, the NCCP decreased most indicators of perceived risk of crime. Our findings point to the need to better manage the implementation of the NCCP as well as to highlight the deterioration of its impact mechanisms in time (particularly its celerity).","In Latin America, criminal justice has been historically slow and bureaucratic by nature. Rarely, justice has been considered as a deterrent. The major cause of these problems has been constantly thought to be the old and bureaucratic rules contained in the Codes of Criminal Procedure.====According to Langer (2007), the newly independent 19th century Latin American republics decided to replace their old Codes of Criminal Procedure for inquisitorial rules. While these Codes were much alike the ones applied in Europe between the 13th and 19th centuries, the countries in the Old Continent were already replacing them by more protective and less inquisitorial models. Even if Latin American countries continued to introduce changes to the inquisitorial model since the 19th century, they kept the basic inquisitorial structure of these Codes (Langer, 2007, p. 631). Procedures continued to be slow.====Since the eighties, the historical sluggishness in the Latin-American criminal justice system became again the object of reform. Several countries in the region replaced the old inquisitorial Codes by a more modern one (adversarial, oral and more protective of the rights of parties). But motivations to do so were not always the same. While in the eighties the new democratic governments implemented new Codes of Criminal Procedure in order to improve the standards in the protection of human rights, in the nineties the new wave of reforms focused on celerity and efficiency as reform drivers (Langer, 2007). In the nineties, Latin America was identified as the most violent region in the world, which led to include in the criminal justice reform two additional and important objectives: reducing crime and perceived risk of crime.====Especially during the nineties, the Code’s primary weakness was its inefficiency. Under inquisitorial Codes, the tasks of charging, investigating and ruling are left to the judge, through a written investigation. This created a sluggish, bureaucratic and ritualistic system (Centro de Estudios de Justicia de las Americas, 2014) with negative consequences. Some studies indicated that more than half of corruption pre-trial investigations that led to closed cases lasted more than three months; and more than half of sexual violence proceedings against minors lasted more than a year (Defensoría del Pueblo, 2007, 2015). This slow inquisitorial model was considered to be responsible for the increase in the overload of criminal proceedings and the high levels of crime (De la Jara et al., 2008).====Since the nineties, more than 200 million dollars in justice reforms with minimum results were spent (Hammergren, 2004). Nevertheless, there are no rigorous impact evaluations in any of the countries where the criminal justice reforms were implemented. This paper addresses this gap.====Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the New Code of Criminal Procedure (NCCP) on crime and perceived risk of crime (2010–2015) in Peru (urban areas). Specifically, impact was assessed on aggregated crime, property crime, and ten individual types of crime. In a similar manner, impact was evaluated on similar outcomes pertaining to perceived risk of crime (aggregated, property crime and individually). Methods relied on a quasi-experimental approach used for a large sample (N = 445,838). Taking advantage of the progressive implementation of the NCCP, first, we used Heckman et al. (1998). Difference-in-Difference (DD) with matching estimator and, second, we differentiated the impact based on whether NCCP was implemented at an early stage (2010) or at a late stage (2012).====Peru adopted the NCCP in the year 2006 under the second wave of reforms in Latin America, aiming at reducing delay (celerity) and increasing solved cases (productivity). The Peruvian NCCP focused on three major changes by introducing oral trials, early closure procedure and a set of management initiatives focused on shortening proceedings. Peruvian authorities hoped this reform –called by judges the “criminal justice revolution”– would reduce in part the high prevalence of crime and perceived risk of crime.

More than 20 years ago, Babcock et al. (1995) challenged this conventional wisdom about the causes of impasse in pretrial bargaining. Their paper conjectures that disputants’ expectations about the pending judicial decision are systematically biased in a self-serving manner. Parties’ beliefs about what constitutes a fair settlement are similarly biased. When the individual assessments of fair settlement outcomes diverge due to self-serving bias, the likelihood of bargaining impasse increases.====In an experiment, Babcock et al. (1995, p. 1338) test for the “causal link between the self-serving bias and non-settlement” in pretrial bargaining. They investigate whether the point in time at which participants get to know their role as plaintiff or defendant in a tort case influences the outcome of bargaining over settling the case. More specifically, they vary whether participants get to know their role before (known-role-treatment) or after (unknown-role-treatment) reading the case materials.==== The hypothesis is that knowledge about the role facilitates reading the case materials and interpreting the information in a self-serving manner. Babcock et al. (1995) employ three different measures to show the validity of self-serving bias as a psychological explanation for reduced settlement frequency: before participants bargain, Babcock et al. (1995) elicit (1) participants’ beliefs about what constitutes a fair settlement amount and (2) participants’ beliefs about a real judge's decision on the case; after participants bargain, (3) participants rate the importance of legal arguments favoring either the plaintiff or the defendant.====We chose Babcock et al. (1995)'s study for replication because we consider the paper a hallmark study in experimental and behavioral law and economics. Babcock et al. (1995) were highly influential for the advent of both experimental and behavioral research in law and economics. Before well-known contributions initiated the research program of “behavioral law and economics” (e.g., Jolls et al., 1998, Korobkin and Ulen, 2000), the paper already stressed the importance of behavioral sciences as well as cognitive and social psychology in legal areas predominantly occupied by rational choice economics. Moreover, the paper is a prime example of how experimental methods can be fruitfully employed to advance our understanding about the interaction between the legal institutions (in this case pretrial bargaining) and the people they seek to govern. Our view appears to be supported by more than 1450 citations that the study of Babcock et al. (1995), it's predecessor (Loewenstein et al., 1993), and the subsequent debiasing study (Babcock et al., 1997) have accumulated.====We think that Babcock et al. (1995)'s study was ahead of its time both in terms of interdisciplinarity and experimental method and, thus, the study is a great candidate for replication. Psychologists have gathered massive evidence for the existence and the underlying mechanisms of self-serving bias in general.==== Nevertheless, to our knowledge, our study is the first direct replication of Babcock et al. (1995)'s paper that investigates the influence of the self-serving bias on bargaining outcomes over a tort case. Additionally, experimental economics and its standards for experiments have considerably evolved since the original paper has been published more than 20 years ago. Therefore, we replicate the original study under more controlled laboratory conditions as compared to the face-to-face interaction between participants in a classroom setting. For instance, the laboratory guarantees anonymity of the experimental subjects and isolates participants from potential distractions. Babcock et al. (1995, p. 1338) state that their experimental design tries to rule out that a “variation in a character trait of the negotiators“ might cause the effect. To make this argument even stronger, we decided to extended upon their design by adding two widely used incentivized post-tests to be able to elicit subject-specific variables on risk- and ambiguity aversion as well as social value orientation. In a sense, our replication pits the original results against a stricter test by venturing into the laboratory.====The next section describes the replication study and the experimental procedure in detail. Section 3 reproduces the original data analysis of Babcock et al. (1995) with the replication data and extends upon it by performing a mediation analysis.

In our design, we compare data from a treatment in which any transfer of points happens only when a player decided to take points from the other one (i.e., in which takings are intentional) to data from a treatment in which transfers are initiated by chance (i.e., takings are random events). Takings that are intentional induce negative emotions (e.g., anger), but this emotional arousal does not influence litigant behavior in terms of either filing a case or spending litigation effort. Our observation is independent of litigation being a one-staged or a (possibly) two-staged contest (i.e., one with an appeal).","Legal experts often argue that litigation costs are excessive, as many litigants bring low-merit suits and devote too many resources to the lawsuit. Potential causes for excessive legal spending include rent-seeking incentives (e.g., Katz, 1988) and emotions calling for retaliation. In support of this latter factor, emotions, as a key driver of decisions in litigation such as filing, settlement, and effort decisions, theoretical considerations (Huang and Wu, 1992, Baumann and Friehe, 2012), interviews with lawyers (Farnsworth, 1999), field data from divorce cases (Farmer and Tiefenthaler, 2001), and survey data (Robbennolt, 2006) have been presented. We use a laboratory experiment of a stylized litigation contest in order to isolate the role of emotions for behavior in such a strategic setting as the laboratory environment helps identifying crucial variables and causal relationships in litigation that are typically obscured in real legal contexts, facilitating the test of specific theoretical hypotheses.====Our experiment is designed so as to arouse similar emotions in the participant in the role of the plaintiff as those of a real-world plaintiff. To this end, the experimental litigation contest is put into the context of a transfer of points, which have previously been earned in a real-effort task, from the participant in the role of the plaintiff to that in the role of the defendant. By succeeding in the litigation contest, the plaintiff can achieve a reversal of this transfer of points. In order to study how emotions impact the plaintiff's decision-making, we follow the approach by Landeo and Spier (2009) by considering two types of treatments: In the ==== treatment, the transfer of points results from the defendant's choice, whereas it is entirely random and unswayable for the defendant in the ==== treatment. While the transfer can be expected to induce negative emotions such as anger or irritation for the plaintiff in either treatment,==== we hypothesize that these emotions are stronger in the endogenous treatment and find empirical support for this hypothesis in our data.==== Our main result is that, despite this difference in the plaintiff's negative emotions, participants in the role of the plaintiff do not make significantly different decisions with regards to initiating a litigation contest or the effort therein.====The role of emotions may also depend on the design of litigation. To address this issue, we consider a scenario in which plaintiffs can appeal their case after losing in the first instance. The plaintiff's possibility of appeal makes winning in the first instance relatively less important, possibly calling for a different effort level, and making the litigation contest more attractive. These distinctions may be neglected by emotionally aroused plaintiffs. In contrast, the potentially longer duration of the conflict may also induce a cooling-off of the plaintiff. We find that plaintiffs in the treatment with possible appeals are just as likely to initiate the litigation contest as those in the one-stage treatment and, additionally, that they invest comparable effort levels.====Experimental evidence supporting that emotions such as anger are very relevant for understanding retaliatory behavior such as punishment abounds (e.g., Bolle et al., 2014, Bosman and van Winden, 2002, Galeotti, 2015; Reuben and van Winden, 2008; Xiao and Houser, 2005; van Winden, 2007). Our paper is also related to a small line of literature using experimental economics to study decision-making in litigation, which has examined the impacts of whether the judicial system is adversarial or inquisitorial (Block and Parker, 2004), of litigants delegating decisions to attorneys (Croson and Mnookin, 1997) and how this delegation is governed contractually (McKee et al., 2007), of the context of settlement bargaining vis-a-vis a standard ultimatum game (Pecorino and Van Boening, 2010), and of the cost allocation rule (Coursey and Stanley, 1988 on settlement bargaining, and Coughlan and Plott, 1997 and Massenot et al., 2017 on litigation contest effort). While Coughlan and Plott (1997) and Massenot et al. (2017) also analyze experimentally decision-making in a litigation contest, neither of them considers the impact of emotions thereon.====In the remainder of the paper, we will first discuss design and implementation of the experiment, and then present the experimental results.

In rational decision making models of crime, this presumption implies that offenders must be risk-seeking. Some scholars claim that this and other anomalous implications are caused by the exclusion of various behavioral considerations in theoretical analyses. This article investigates whether a model in which criminals over-weigh probabilities attached to more salient payoffs (as the term is used by Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer in a series of influential articles) performs better than simple expected utility theory in explaining criminal behavior that is more responsive to the certainty than the severity of punishment. The analysis reveals that the answer is negative unless the probability of punishment is unreasonably high. This finding suggests that we should exercise caution in incorporating salience – a la Bordalo et al. – in models of criminal behavior.","A question that has attracted criminologists’ and law and economics scholars’ attention is whether the certainty or the severity of punishment has a greater deterrent effect. More than 250 years ago, Beccaria provided his answer to this question by formulating what I call the Certainty Aversion Presumption (henceforth ====),==== which suggests that the certainty of punishment is the greater deterrent among these two measures.==== In the criminology literature, there is a long line of (continuing) research which empirically investigates the validity of ==== (Gibbs, 1968, Tittle, 1969, Paternoster, 1987, Klepper and Nagin, 1989, Nagin and Pogarsky, 2001, Nagin and Pogarsky, 2003, Nagin, 2013). The research suggests that it is difficult to conclusively ascertain whether ==== is a valid presumption, and the differential effect of the two factors is context dependent. However, ==== has so much intuitive appeal that many legal scholars accept it as an empirical fact, and there are many studies that provide evidence that supports it (Nagin and Pogarsky, 2001, Nagin and Pogarsky, 2003, Nagin, 2013).====The question has also received considerable attention in the economics literature, in which scholars formulated rational decision making theories to study criminal behavior. In the process, economists framed ==== in terms of elasticities: the certainty elasticity of deterrence is presumed to be greater than the severity elasticity of deterrence. Gary Becker, in his article that provided the workhorse economics model for studying criminal behavior, showed that if ==== holds, and if offenders are expected utility maximizers, then they must also be risk-seeking (Becker, 1968, p. 178 and n. 19). The existing literature has interpreted this implication as an anomaly, and has provided multiple extensions of the Beckerian model that explain ==== without resorting to risk preferences of offenders (Neilson and Winter, 1997, Block and Lind, 1975, Pyne, 2012, Mungan and Klick, 2014). Most of these explanations still remained within the expected utility framework.====In recent years, many scholars have attempted to explain other anomalies in the criminal context by considering behavioral biases (e.g. Pogarsky et al., 2017). Most relatedly to the instant article, some scholars suggest that the salience of various schemes may play a role in shaping wrong-doers behaviors.==== This claim, like ====, has a lot of intuitive appeal: people are more likely to be deterred in circumstances where the punishment is more salient, since this may cause them to take the prospect of punishment more seriously. Thus, one may legitimately seek a decision theoretical framework that goes beyond the expected utility framework to incorporate salience, with the hope that it may allow us to better understand and explain criminal decision making.====This article investigates whether an influential decision theoretical model of salience, recently proposed by Bordalo et al. (henceforth BGS), may perform better than expected utility theory in predicting criminal behavior. In particular, it investigates whether the BGS model produces results that are consistent with ====. This model was proposed in Bordalo et al. (2012), and since then, has been applied across diverse fields including judicial decision making (Bordalo et al., 2015), consumer choice (Bordalo et al., 2013a) and asset pricing (Bordalo et al., 2013b). Although this model has provided interesting explanations in these fields, as the instant article demonstrates, expected utility performs better in predicting ====-consistent behavior in the criminal context. This suggests that scholars of criminal behavior ought to exercise caution in adopting a salience based model to study criminal behavior, and that more research is necessary to properly and usefully incorporate ‘salience’ into decision making models in the criminal context.====Before explaining the methodology used in this article, and the results derived by doing so, it is useful to briefly explain how BGS conceive of salience. A primary objective of Bordalo et al. (2012) is to incorporate salience as a psychologically relevant consideration into a simple economic decision making model. BGS describe salience as a “phenomenon that when one's attention is differentially directed to one portion of the environment rather than to others, the information contained in that portion will receive disproportionate weighting in subsequent judgments.” (BGS, 2012 citing Taylor and Thompson, 1982). For operationalization purposes, BGS define salience as a property of lottery payoffs, and explain this property as follows: “Roughly speaking a lottery payoff is salient if it is very different in percentage terms from the payoffs of other available lotteries (in the same state of the world).” The authors then consider individuals who over-weigh the probabilities attached to more salient states in making decisions under uncertainty, and demonstrate that this type of decision making provides explanations for empirically puzzling observations such as the Allais paradox and preference reversals.====In this article, I ask whether BGS's salience theory may similarly provide an explanation for ====. I find that salience theory performs worse than simple expected utility in generating ====-consistent behavior among offenders in simple Beckerian law enforcement models as long as the probability of punishment is less than half, which is a condition that holds in many empirically relevant cases. Results can more specifically be listed as follows. In the simplest version of the Beckerian model where sanctions are monetary and potential offenders possess linear value functions, ==== cannot emerge in a salience-based decision making model, unless the probability of being detected for a crime is greater than half. In settings where offenders’ marginal disutility from punishment is not constant, e.g. when sanctions may involve imprisonment, and when the probability of punishment is smaller than half, salience based decision making models narrow the set of circumstances in which offenders may exhibit ====-consistent behavior relative to the analogous set of circumstances implied by simple expected utility theory.====The next section describes the standard Beckerian rational decision making model of crime, which is modified to allow salience (à la BGS) to play a role in potential criminals’ decision making. Section 3 extends the analysis to study the use of non-monetary sanctions, and Section 4 concludes.",Salience and the severity versus the certainty of punishment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818819300067,March 2019,2019,Research Article,200.0

Since there is ample experimental evidence of malice as a motive, and since it is even more relevant between disputing parties, the new explanation that the paper suggests for both settlement failure and the timing of settlements is likely significant. The results are robust to a change in bargaining protocol to alternate offers, to the trial date being endogenous in an infinite horizon model, and to the introduction of costly discovery and uncertainty of plaintiff victory.","This paper is the first to use the concept of malice – utility gained when others are financially or psychologically harmed or deprived– to address two interconnected questions in law and economics: why do some cases proceed to trial instead of settling, and why do almost all cases that settle get settled either very quickly, or just before the trial date (on the “courthouse steps”)?====Conventional explanations of these two law and economics puzzles mainly center around incomplete or asymmetric information between the plaintiff and the defendant, or “divergent expectations” where the two parties have different expectations about the trial (such as about the probability of each party’s winning), perhaps due to optimism or other “self-serving biases”. Hay and Spier (1997) provide an excellent summary of much of the conventional literature on these topics. They argue that the “divergent expectations” explanations also ultimately rely on some form of incomplete information, which may go away with the arrival of better information. For instance, in a more recent paper, Vasserman and Yildiz (2018), both plaintiff and defendant are optimistic, but may revise their expectations based on information about the trial that arrives following a Poisson process.====In contrast, my malice-based explanation is built into a complete information model. Thus, I show that even if both parties know all the parameters relevant to the litigation and settlement process, both these puzzles would still arise if the plaintiff and defendant bear each other malice.====I incorporate two forms of malice into a complete information model where a trial date is exogenously set, and a plaintiff can make settlement demands to a defendant in each period before the trial, a la Spier (1992). The first form of malice involves financial motives: both parties obtain a malice utility per unit spent by the other (they feel happy when the other party incurs financial expenses, even though this might not necessarily result in direct financial gain to them). The second form of malice is more psychological and indicates that both parties derive pleasure from making the other party wait for a resolution====. This captures their satisfaction from inconveniencing the other party for longer, and from causing reputational and psychological harm. In Spier (1992), her complete information model entails only immediate settlement. To explain why many cases are also settled on the courthouse steps, while other cases proceed to trial, she uses an incomplete information model. In contrast, in the present paper, all of these phenomena arise with complete information.====As a motive, malice matters both in the laboratory and in the courtroom. A rich experimental literature, including Beckman et al (2002), Bosman and van Winden (2002); Bosman et al (2006); Albert and Mertins (2008); Zizzo and Oswald (2001); Abbink and Sadrieh (2008), and Abbink and Herrmann (2011), has illustrated the importance of malice. For instance, Zizzo and Oswald (2001) find, in a “money burning” game, that two-thirds of their subjects were so eager to destroy others’ earnings that they were actually willing to ==== for the privilege of doing so. Bosman and van Winden (2002) find, in a “power to take” experiment, that 21% of their subjects destroy their own earnings when told that a portion of these earnings would later go to another subject. In Abbink and Herrmann’s (2011) one-shot “joy of destruction” game, 10–25% of their subjects destroyed others’ endowments without any economic gain to themselves. Beckman et al find that 50% of their experimental subjects oppose Pareto improvements that make others better off without making them any worse off.====Malice also matters in the courtroom. Legal systems have always allowed for the possibility of “malicious litigation” – that a plaintiff may sue driven by a desire to harm the defendant’s finances and reputation, and have adopted countermeasures to deal with this possibility, such as “amercement” and the “writ of conspiracy” in Norman times, and the tort of malicious prosecution in modern times (see Guha (2016) for details). Another modern countermeasure against malice is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which sanctions attorneys if they can be shown to have needlessly harassed or delayed the other party to the lawsuit, or to have otherwise increased the cost of litigation. Real life cases in which malicious prosecution was invoked include medical malpractice suits, suits filed by business rivals (some patent infringement suits were aimed at driving rivals out of business), and those involving estranged partners, extended family disputes, or quarrelling neighbors.====Guha (2016) introduces malice into a simple one-period game of litigation. Unlike the current paper, it does not consider multiple periods or the timing of settlements. It also incorporates just one of the two forms of malice that the current paper discusses (the financial one). Finally, the two models differ from each other in assumptions and timing.====Another related paper on malice is Guha (2018), which incorporates malice into a game of Rubinstein alternating offers bargaining. In that paper, malice takes the form of utility derived in each period in which the opponent is deprived of a share of the pie. This is closer to the second form of malice considered in the current paper. That paper, however, does not involve the threat of litigation, and simply assumes that the two parties bargain over a pie over an infinite horizon. Later in the current paper, I examine the robustness of my results to alternating offers and to an infinite horizon.====An added reason for wanting to explore the role of bilateral malice in the interaction between potentially litigating parties is that such parties are more likely to bear each other grudges (and therefore be malicious) as compared to any two randomly matched parties (significantly, spite is pointed out as an explanation for some empirical or experimental findings on litigation and settlement, as in Korobkin and Guthrie, 1994 and Farmer and Tiefenthaler, 2001, as discussed shortly). Thus, malice is likely a significant factor explaining the fact of U-shaped settlement timings, and of occasional settlement failure, noted above.====I now briefly review the related law and economics literature, in addition to the papers already mentioned. As noted by Spier (1992) and Vasserman and Yildiz (2018), among others, cases are settled either very early, with the frequency of settlements decreasing in the duration of negotiation (Kessler, 1996), or very late (Williams (1983) reports that 70% of civil cases in Arizona were settled within 30 days from the court date, while 13% were settled on the day of the trial itself). Similarly, Fournier and Zuehlke (1996) document the phenomenon that settlements are often long delayed. Apart from Spier’s model, some other relatively early work tries to address why not all cases are settled (they do not focus as much on why there may be delays in settlement). Among many others, these include Nalebuff (1987); Loewenstein et al (1993); Daughety and Reinganum (1994), and Wang et al (1994). Nalebuff (1987) has an incomplete information model where plaintiffs, who may demand settlement, do not know the defendant’s type, but must ensure that their threat to sue is credible. Thus, they often ask for settlements that are “too high”, are consequently refused by defendants whose case is strong, and thus some cases go to court. Wang et al (1994) consider an environment with an uninformed defendant who moves first, and an informed plaintiff who has the option to go to court. In their model, the informed plaintiff either accepts the defendant’s first period offer, or rejects it (if the plaintiff has a better chance of winning) and goes to court in the second period: thus a game lasts for at most two periods. Daughety and Reinganum (1994) consider two-sided asymmetric information about the probability of winning and the extent of damages.====Loewenstein et al (1993) explore the role of “self-serving biases”. They argue that both plaintiffs and defendants may overestimate their chances of winning at trial, since such biases are self-serving. Accordingly, their ideas of what constitutes a fair settlement also differ (since they do not agree on the probabilities of the two parties winning). This might, thus, make it difficult to arrive at a mutually acceptable settlement. Birkeland and Tungodden (2014) show how disagreements can arise in a Nash demand game if both players care about fairness and have mutually incompatible views on what constitutes a fair division. Karagozoglu and Keskin (2018) consider a Rubinstein bargaining game with a deadline after which the pie disappears. They consider players who attach time-varying weights on fairness, such that these weights decline as the deadline approaches. They find that if the two players have mutually compatible fairness weights, a solution with immediate agreement coexists with a delayed agreement solution (though this delayed agreement does not necessarily occur at the deadline). If the players have mutually incompatible weights, a solution with delayed agreement coexists with the possibility of disagreement. My model and results differ from theirs in some key aspects. Malice, unlike fairness concerns in their model, does not diminish over time. Instead of the pie disappearing at a deadline, in my model, litigation occurs after a fixed horizon, and malice affects litigation payoffs as well. As for the results, I do not find multiple equilibria in the same parameter zone, unlike their paper: in mine, the parameter zone uniquely determines whether immediate settlement, settlement at the courthouse steps, or litigation results. In my paper, if delayed agreement occurs, it occurs at the deadline, unlike in theirs where it may occur before the deadline.====Vasserman and Yildiz (2018), who consider optimistic biases before the arrival of trial-relevant information, show that cases may either settle immediately (when optimism is low), settle relatively late or just before the trial (when optimism is moderate), or go to trial (when optimism is very high). This literature is close to my paper because psychological factors are involved. Nonetheless, my approach differs because I do not consider biases that may vanish in the face of new information. Malice, in my model, is an intrinsic component of utility that constitutes an important force irrespective of the informational environment.====Sullivan (2016), while testing for the asymmetric information explanation of delays in settlement using an experimental treatment group exposed to asymmetric information, and a control group with symmetric information, found that asymmetric information did appear to delay settlement times. Nonetheless, the paper also found that even in symmetric information environments, delays and disagreements could occur. This underscores the need to explore what factors could cause such delays or disagreements even in complete information environments.====I now briefly discuss more of the literature relating emotions to litigation. Huang and Wu (1992) describe psychological games, where a player’s payoffs from certain strategies reflect his beliefs about the likelihood of his opponent playing other strategies. In a litigation game, a player may be angry if his opponent is likely to take a hard stance (trying to sue instead of settle) and this anger may increase his own payoff from litigation. They find that this results in higher equilibrium litigation levels, with the possibility of multiple equilibrium levels of litigation and accordingly, multiple equilibrium levels of anger (endogenously determined). Baumann and Friehe (2012) describe litigation as a contest determined by the two parties’ levels of investment, and find that emotions can either increase or decrease investment. Korobkin and Guthrie (1994) experimentally test for several psychological barriers to settlement, including framing effects (plaintiffs who think they are facing a “loss” become risk-seeking and are inclined to take the risky option of litigation compared to the surer one of settlement), anchoring (plaintiffs who have a high initial offer as a reference point are reluctant to settle for anything less), inequity aversion (plaintiffs are eager to sue if they feel the defendant is much better off), and spite/dislike of the defendant (accordingly plaintiffs are less likely to want to accept an offer from the defendant). They find evidence for all of these effects. Farmer and Tiefenthaler (2001) empirically study the determinants of settlement versus litigation in divorce cases. They find more support for an explanation based on asymmetric information than one based on optimism biases. However, they note that some of their results that seem supportive of asymmetric information can also support a role for spite. Specifically, they find that litigation decreases, the longer the gap between a couple’s separation and filing for divorce. While this is compatible with information asymmetries being resolved during this long gap, thus resulting in less litigation, it is also compatible (as they note) with a long gap denoting less spite (particularly spiteful couples filed as soon as they separated) leading to less litigation.====In addition to these papers, my paper is also broadly connected to the literature on other-regarding preferences (for surveys, see Sobel (2005) and Cooper and Kagel (2016)).====The rest of my paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains my model and results. The intuition underlying my results is also discussed after each main result. Section 3 contains a number of robustness checks. It considers (i) an alternating offers bargaining protocol instead of the plaintiff making settlement demands in each period prior to the trial, (ii) an infinite horizon and an endogenous trial date instead of an exogenous one, and (iii) uncertain plaintiff victory with the option to invest in costly discovery. I find that my main results are very robust. Section 4 contains a discussion on empirically testable implications of my model and the possibility of measuring malice empirically or experimentally.

Our findings reveal the importance of the type of norm-enforcement mechanism in determining the robustness of norm adherence in the long term.","Law is traditionally defined as a set of formal rules, promulgated by legislatures, regulatory agencies, and courts, and that is backed by the threat of monetary punishment or imprisonment (Posner and Rasmusen, 1999). However, rules of conduct can also be informal insofar as they do not depend on government for either their promulgation or enforcement. When norm-enforcement consists in the refusal to interact with the offender or in the expression of disapproval of one's actions, for example, behavior is considered to be influenced by informal norms.====During the 1990s, the relationship between formal rules and informal norms became topical within the field of law and economics. As Ellickson notes, “in the mid-1990s norms became one of the hottest topics in the legal academy” (1998, p. 543). The quantity and the quality of published papers on this topic rose significantly, as evidenced by the development of an area of research referred to as the law-and-economics of norms (Feldman, 2009) and by the attention given to the topic in prominent law journals.====On a more fundamental level, this literature has focused on the relative effectiveness of two types of deterrence: peer-enforced norms versus publicly-enforced, codified laws. Some have argued that peer-enforcement can serve as an adequate deterrent, effectively establishing and maintaining cooperation (Ellickson, 1991). Others claim that informal mechanisms are not, in fact, effective and that formal rules enforced by external authorities are requisite elements of a stable social order.====The focus on the comparative advantages of one system versus the other, surprisingly, neglects the fact that formal rules may not be effective without the support of corresponding informal social norms (Boettke et al., 2008). Indeed, insofar as informal norms can be considered an inherent element of the fabric of society (Elster, 1989; Bicchieri, 2006), they necessarily precede formal rules and therefore serve an important legitimizing function.==== This literature also suggests that informal norms tend to be stickier than formal rules (Carbonara et al., 2012). The well-established interactions between these two systems gives us reason to believe that formal rules may affect the functioning of informal norms not only when they are implemented, but also when they are lifted. The long-lasting effects of temporary, formal rules on informal norms have received relatively limited attention within the law and economics literature to date.====Gneezy and Rustichini's (2000) classic field study documenting the capacity for formal sanctions to crowd-out private enforcement serves as a natural motivation for the present study. Here we are particularly interested in the potential for these effects to persist even after a formal rule is no longer in force. We are interested in whether the mechanism by which an informal norm is enforced may have implications for its robustness to post-intervention crowding-out effects. Given the problematic nature of manipulating and measuring the impact of temporary formal rules on informal norms in the field,==== we turn to the use of experimental economic methods to investigate post-intervention dynamics between the two in a controlled way.====In what follows, we carry out a laboratory public goods experiment in which we add and subsequently remove an externally-enforced formal rule, in the form of a monetary sanction, in the context of two different informal norm enforcement mechanisms. In a first treatment, we give individuals the opportunity to send anonymous, non-costly disapproval points to each other based on contributions made in the previous round. The inclusion of this treatment was motivated by a robust finding in the literature demonstrating that informal norms are supported by low-cost expressions of social disapproval, such as ridicule and gossip (Ellickson, 1991, Boehm, 1999, Feinberg et al., 2012, Guala, 2012).====In the second treatment, we implement another informal mechanism that has been shown to invoke remorse among those who deviate from normative behavior. Specifically, there exists a good deal of evidence that the loss of ‘face’ is an important motivator of individual action (Bohnet and Frey, 1999, Rege and Telle, 2004; Coricelli et al., 2010, 2014). Ho (1976) defines the concept of ‘face’ as one's positive social value or respectability, the loss of which makes it more difficult to function in society. Thus, following every round in this treatment, we display a picture of each group member next to his contribution. While the first informal norm enforcement mechanism we implement relies on the explicit expression of disapproval by one's peers, the latter rests on one's belief about how he is perceived by the others around him (Andreoni and Petrie, 2004, Bursztyn and Jensen, 2017). The novelty of this work is that we use controlled laboratory conditions to measure the impact of social context, as characterized by different norm-enforcement mechanisms (disapproval or face-saving), on the legacy of temporary monetary sanctions. In doing so, we aim to investigate the importance of norm-enforcement mechanisms in determining the robustness of norm adherence in the long run.====In each of our treatments, subjects progress through three different sequences in the experiment.==== In the first sequence of all treatments, subjects play a standard public goods game for ten periods. In the second sequence (periods 11–20) of the control treatments, we either provide the opportunity to express social disapproval or display subjects’ photographs next to their contributions at the end of each period. In the second sequence of the test treatments, we complement the informal mechanism (disapproval points or photographs) with an exogenously-imposed monetary sanction.==== In the third sequence of the game, we remove the monetary sanction in the test treatments, leaving the informal mechanisms (disapproval points or photographs) in place.====We find a striking difference in the effectiveness of these informal enforcement mechanisms once the external mechanism has been removed. In a social context characterized by peer disapproval, we observe strong negative post-intervention crowding-out: in the treatment where subjects had been exposed to monetary sanctions, cooperation under peer-disapproval in the third sequence falls to levels below those observed under baseline conditions, i.e. when subjects had not been exposed to external monetary sanctions. This is not the case for the treatment leveraging face-saving concerns, where post-intervention cooperation levels remain higher than under baseline conditions. Insofar as this face-saving mechanism appears to be robust to the negative post-intervention effect that is observed in the context of peer disapproval, these results suggest that increasing the saliency of social image concerns may ultimately be a more suitable deterrent strategy than relying on anonymous peer disapproval, and especially so in conjunction with the use of formal, external enforcement mechanisms. In this way, our findings suggest that face-saving concerns lead to the creation of stickier norms than anonymous peer-disapproval.",The stickiness of norms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818303405,30 December 2018,2018,Research Article,202.0

First, the flexibility granted by arbitration would allow parties to write dispute settlement clauses that are tailored to their individual preferences. Second, concerns for home biases would provide incentives to remove the dispute settlement process from either parties’ domestic judicial system. And third, a greater ease of enforcement would cause parties to prefer arbitration over litigation.====This study examines the validity of these theoretical claims relying on over half a million contracts filed with the SEC between 2000 and 2016. The results suggest that arbitration clauses are less frequently adopted than clauses referring parties to the domestic court system. If they are included, arbitration clauses serve the specific purpose of strategically reducing the discretion granted to the courts enforcing the decision. Absent serious threats to enforcement, parties prefer courts over arbitration, making arbitration a second-best-alternative to a well-functioning domestic judiciary.","International arbitration is an intriguing phenomenon. Some view it as the hallmark for the settlement of cross-border disputes, arguing that it promotes efficiency of the dispute settlement process by providing a reliable enforcement mechanism (Fisher and Haydock, 1995). Arbitration is also viewed as an important instrument to overcome “hostage-taking”, which originates from exchanges that require specialized investments (Williamson, 1983). Others, both in- and outside of the international commercial setting, are skeptical, pointing to the fact that arbitration creates a private and largely secret alternative court system. Some argue that, since decisions tend to not be available to the public and thus, are inadequate to establish precedent, arbitration does not provide a public good through its rendering of a decision (Landes and Posner, 1979). Others criticize the nontransparency associated with the arbitral process that would diminish its legitimacy (Lew, 1982, Buys, 2003, Gruner, 2003). However, for all debate on the normative desirability of international arbitration, it is striking how little we know about its actual use in practice.====Empirical uncertainty surrounds the question of how prevalent international arbitration is to begin with. Estimates for the share of international agreements that include arbitration clauses range from 15% to 90% (Casella, 1996, Weidemaier, 2015, Eisenberg and Miller, 2007), leading to considerable disagreement on whether arbitration is an essential pillar in the landscape of international dispute settlement or a mechanism that is used in only a narrow, more or less coherent subset of contracts.====In addition to the question ==== parties are relying on arbitration to a significant degree, it is also unclear ==== parties would prefer arbitration over courts in a commercial context. The standard narrative suggests three sets of reasons. First, arbitral proceedings, being privately organized, are believed to be more susceptible to the specific needs of the business community, in turn allowing for a more efficient resolution of the dispute. Second, it is assumed that parties have an incentive to avoid foreign courts due to concerns for home biases, and that arbitration allows them to remove the dispute from the domestic court system of either party. And third, arbitral awards are viewed as more easily enforceable than foreign court decisions. However, while all these motivations might seem theoretically appealing, so far none of them have been validated empirically.====This article then provides the most comprehensive look at the practice and relevance of international commercial arbitration to date. It uses the population of over half a million material contracts of publicly held companies registered with the SEC between 2000 and 2016 to examine the role of arbitration in international contracts. The analysis yields two main findings. First, U.S. parties and those with close economic ties to the U.S. only rarely rely on arbitration. Whereas 25% of international agreements include arbitration clauses, 34% include clauses referring parties to domestic courts. Under the assumption that parties routinely opt for the optimal procedure, this implies that parties do not view arbitration procedures as more efficient than litigation. Second, there is little evidence to suggest that litigating in another countries’ court is a general concern for parties. Instead, companies strategically use arbitral tribunals only if the contractual partner comes from a country with judicial institutions that pose a risk to the enforcement of a U.S. court decision. If the quality of the foreign judicial institutions is not in doubt, parties are much more likely to refer disputes to the U.S. judiciary than to arbitration.====Together, the findings shine a new light on the relevance of international arbitration in a commercial context. Whereas arbitration has often been portrayed as a broadly applicable solution to idiosyncratic problems arising out of complex international business agreements, the results of this study imply that it serves a much more limited and specific function. In particular, parties treat international arbitration as a second-best alternative to a well-functioning domestic court system that is used not in order to avoid foreign courts, but in an attempt to avoid supposedly dysfunctional court systems.====The rest of the article proceeds as follows: The next section provides the theoretical underpinnings and an overview of the empirical literature on arbitration clause usage.

Rigid legal application of fiscal ==== may curtail structural reforms, as reforms can go against fiscal consolidation in the short run. However, if reforms are expected to improve public finances in the long run, they should not be viewed as incompatible with the legal framework. Focussing on the case of EU fiscal surveillance, this paper identifies the circumstances under which the positive budgetary long-term effect of structural reforms materialize in such a way that the legal rules should be applied with a degree of leniency, allowing for a short-term deterioration of the fiscal position. To that end, we quantify the short-run fiscal costs and long-run fiscal benefits of reforms, and investigate how the design of reforms can affect this trade-off. Results suggest that as short run output losses of reforms are alleviated by ====, long run output gains from the reforms imply that fiscal viability can be reached within a reasonable period of time. Product market reforms are generally preferable over ====, as they have a larger impact on fiscal revenues. These insights inform the legal analysis in several regards. First, the economic analysis is in line with teleological interpretation of legal rules aimed at ensuring long-term fiscal stability, while allowing short-term fiscal leniency. Second, the economic analysis can give contours to vague legal terms, such as “prompt” positive budgetary effects and the legal requirement of “major” structural reforms, showing that the type of reform matters as much as the size of the reform, and that while larger reforms have larger long run budgetary effects, they also require greater leniency in the short run. More generally, our analysis calls for the design and interpretation of legal fiscal regimes with reference to the interdependency between fiscal policy and structural economic policies.","Application of fiscal rules is often considered in clinical disciplinary isolation. While lawyers tend to care about dogmatic consistency and uniform application of rules, economists are concerned about the effects of the specific design of fiscal rules. However, legal interpretation and economic effects interact and a legal analysis being informed about the economic effects associated with certain ways of legal interpretation may tune the overall application of rule enforcement. The recent EU debt crisis has brought to the forefront the need for lawyers and economists to relate their disciplinary contributions to each other. Disrespect of fiscal rules has been widely recognized as a major cause for sovereign debt turmoils in the recent Euro-area crisis and the austerity measures imposed as response to the crisis follow the logic of fiscal retrenchment. At the same time, an insufficient level of structural reforms remains a perennial phenomon in the EU. Some of these reforms are critical for the growth and sustainability of the Euro-zone as a whole, as they imply positive externalities across countries (European Commission, 2014b).====By design, fiscal regimes are established with the aim to constrain public expenditures and policy manoeuvre, for which there may be sound economic reason. Firstly, the strategic interaction of fiscal and monetary policy-makers can create an incentive for over-borrowing, as the fiscal authority's decision to issue debt ignores the associated costs of inducing inflation for other members of the currency union (Dixit and Lambertini, 2001, Chari and Kehoe, 2007). Moreover, there can be negative spillover effects from sovereign debt on other members of a currency union (Antonakakis and Vergos, 2013), as well as a negative impact on growth inflicted by the fiscal burden (Panizza and Presbitero, 2014). Finally, there is the political economy insight that political decision-makers’ focus on re-election can undermine fiscal discipline to the detriment of future generations (Beetsma and Debrun, 2004, Poplawski-Ribeiro and Beetsma, 2008). However, independent of the underlying reason for the fiscal rules, the problem of how to legally implement and enforce these rules has been contentious from the start.====In the early years of the SGP, there was a consensus that its implementation was not satisfactory (Morris et al., 2006). In 2005, the SGP was reformed, taking into account that the strict application of fiscal rules may be counter-productive in cases where economic policy measures may improve the fiscal stance in the long-term, the short-term fiscal burden notwithstanding. This applies particularly to two instances: First, public investment may stimulate growth and thus improve the debt-to-GDP situation, while giving rise to numerous controversial issues regarding nature, size and crowding-out (Mourougane et al., 2016). Second, structural reforms are widely claimed to be necessary in order to foster growth (Griffith and Harrison, 2004, Griffith et al., 2007, Fiori et al., 2012, International Monetary Fund, 2017), but may have short-term costs that prevent their implementation, and that monetary policy is not suited to offset (Leiner-Killinger et al., 2007). There is limited evidence that these costs are being borne instead by fiscal policy (Deroose and Turrini, 2005, ECB, 2015b) but in recent years some have called for fiscal policy to be more active in mitigating the short-term costs of reforms in order to remove barriers to their implementation (Draghi, 2014). Moreover, the success of the reformed SGP has been mixed, with some studies finding no evidence that fiscal policy of member states has improved (Poplawski-Ribeiro, 2009). As such there is still a live policy debate about both the effectiveness of the SGP (ECB, 2015a) and possible further reforms to the rules (Banerji et al., 2015).====This study relates to this debate by examining the interaction between legal and economic insight in the relationship between fiscal rules and structural reforms. The analytical approach is to indicate avenues of legal interpretation by incorporating economic analysis on the impact of structural reforms on a country's fiscal position. This analysis seeks an economic interpretation of the EU rules governing fiscal conduct and highlights how legal interpretation can be informed by economic insight. Legal and economic questions in the domain of fiscal governance interact.====Relevant legal questions are: How can fiscal rules be interpreted to the extent that structural reforms should be accounted for under the fiscal governance regime? Can fiscal leeway be granted in exchange for structural reforms? And how can certain vague legal terms – such as “prompt” positive budgetary effect of structural reforms or “major” structural reforms – be interpreted with a sound economic rationale? These legal questions can be addressed through economic analysis. To understand whether a government should invest time and public expenditure on the costs of structural reforms, it is important to compare the potential short run fiscal costs to the effects of those reforms on public finances in the long run. In particular, reforms which boost economic growth can improve the fiscal balance in the long run, and so be self-financing despite the fiscal costs in the short run. Methodologically, this can be shown by simulating reform scenarios within a structural model of the Euro-area. This will give us quantitative estimates of both short run fiscal costs, under different assumptions about the fiscal response to the reforms, and long run fiscal gains from different reforms.====Based on our theoretical framework, we show that economic analysis supports the leeway to account for the implementation of structural reforms identified through legal reasoning. We identify the circumstances under which the positive budgetary long-term effect of structural reforms are such that the legal rules should be applied with a degree of leniency allowing for a short-term deterioration of the fiscal position in return for greater long-term fiscal position. We further provide economic meaning to the legal terms “prompt” (related to the timely positive budgetary effect) and “major” (related to the size of the reform).====Hence, the article aims at offering a three-fold contribution: First, it modifies the seemingly opposing position of fiscal stance and (costly) structural reforms by adding analytical differentiation with regard to size, type and dynamic effects of structural reforms. Second, the analysis reveals the economic underpinning of legal rules on fiscal governance and offers insight which can inform political decision-making on the enforcement of fiscal legal rules. Third and on a general note, it highlights how economic insight can be used for a genuine legal interpretation exercise, which underscores the argumentative force of holding legal terms susceptible for interdisciplinary transfer.====The article is structured as follows: the next section lays out the framework for the legal analysis and the open legal questions around the interplay between fiscal rules and structural reforms. The third section details the economic analysis used to inform those questions, and the fourth section takes those economic insights back to the legal analysis.",Fiscal rules and structural reforms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818301613,21 December 2018,2018,Research Article,204.0

While these papers argued that their results largely negate the possibility of that there exist large “mismatch” effects in law schools associated with preferential admissions given to black applicants, Sander argues that when he corrects and/or extends their methods, the results largely suggest mismatch to be quite prevalent. As I discuss below, I think both of these conclusions are too strong. Even under Sander’s replications and extensions, the evidence both for or against mismatch is simply quite weak given these data and methods.","As far as replication projects go, “Replication of Mismatch Research: Ayers, Brooks, Ho” is a bit of a complicated one. Richard Sander published “A Systemic Analysis of Affirmative Action in American Law Schools” in the Stanford Law Review in 2004. His paper argued that affirmative action in favor of black students in law school admissions was hurting black students by “mismatching” them to schools where they may have been underqualified, subsequently causing them to learn less than they would have if they had attended schools where their credentials more resembled those of their classmates, thereby hurting their post-school career prospects.====Not surprisingly, Sander’s paper was controversial. While many of those critiquing it seemed to essentially take umbrage with the basic research question being asked, there were some attempts to rigorously examine the robustness of Sander’s results. Arguably the most well-known of these more rigorous critiques are Ayers and Brooks, (2004) and Ho (2005), both of whom argue that their results largely negate the conclusions Sander draws in his 2004 paper. The study by Sander contained in this issue attempts to replicate and examine these two studies that critiqued his original 2004 article.====Despite the deluge of criticisms Sander’s original mismatch paper received, it seems to be a sensible and important research question. Is it better for a student, particularly a black student, to attend a more prestigious institution where his/her incoming qualifications lag behind the vast majority of the other students, or is it better to attend a less prestigious institution where his/her incoming qualifications more closely align with those of his/her peers? The answer isn’t obvious. On the one hand, if a student attends a school where his/her incoming qualifications fall well behind the vast majority of his/her classmates, this could mean the level at which the classes are taught make it difficult for the student to keep up, could make finding study partners difficult, and/or could simply make school demoralizing, all of which may cause the student’s learning to suffer relative to if he/she had attended a school where his/her incoming qualifications more closely matched those of his/her peers. On the other hand, even if a student’s incoming qualifications lag behind most of his/her classmates, attending a more prestigious institution could give the student access to better instruction, more helpful peer interactions, and more valuable alumni networks, all helping the student find more success than if he/she attended a less prestigious school. In the end, determining which of these possible effects dominates seems to be a valid empirical question.====From a research standpoint, the best way to analyze such a question would be to take a large group of relatively homogenous prospective black law students and randomize them into a variety of different schools, some where their credentials lie in the middle of the school’s credential distribution, and some where their credentials lie at the bottom of the school’s credential distribution. Then, follow these students over time and observe not only how they did on the bar exam, but more importantly how they did on the job market (e.g., whether they got a job, salary of the job, whether they are on a partner track, how much partners make in the firm they matched with). Such a design would seem to provide a credible answer to the question of interest.====The general problem here though, as in many empirical studies, is that the gold standard approach described above has not been able to be performed. This leaves more indirect approaches such as those taken by Sander (2004); Ayers and Brooks, (2004), and Ho (2005). As I discuss below, while Sander certainly raises some important and valid critiques of Ayers and Brooks, (2004) and Ho (2005), my view is that his results reveal that the methods and data used in these papers simply do not provide much in the way of definitive evidence for or against the mismatch hypothesis, and are therefore unable to shed much light on whether preferential treatment of black applicants in law school admissions is on average helping, hurting, or not really affecting black law students.====In the following three sections, I discuss and analyze the three general approaches Sander attempts to replicate and explore.","“Replication of mismatch research: Ayers, Brooks, and Ho” (Comment)",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818302631,19 December 2018,2018,Research Article,208.0

This suggests that, while environmental violations were costly to firms in the eighties and nineties, most of the costs were reflected in firms’ fines and/or remediation costs rather than any market-induced reputational penalty.====Reputational penalties provide disincentives for misconduct. Empirical research estimates large reputational costs associated with false advertising (Peltzman, 1981), financial misrepresentation (Karpoff and Lott, 1993; Karpoff et al., 2008), product recalls (Jarrell and Peltzman, 1985), poor safety records (Mitchell and Maloney, 1989), and certain violations of financial regulations (Armour et al., 2017). In these settings, revelations of wrongdoing convey information about the future value of interacting with the misbehaving firm for parties with whom the firm directly interacts, like suppliers or consumers. In other settings, regulations and the associated penalties for non-compliance are designed to internalize social costs. If revelations of wrongdoing in these settings do not affect the future value of interacting with the firm, then the reputational costs of misconduct will be negligible. KLW’s finding of no reputational costs is consistent with the environmental setting falling into this category during the period covered by their analysis.====We contribute to the literature on reputational costs by first conducting a pure replication (Hamermesh, 2007) of KLW.==== Our second contribution consists of a scientific replication for which we collect new data covering a more recent time period, 2001–2016.We follow KLW in measuring the reputational effect by comparing the estimated cumulative abnormal return associated with the announcement of an environmental violation and the implied reduction in firm value due to the associated legal penalties. Because the contributing factors (e.g., legal penalties, firm value) vary over time as we document in the next section, we need not expect the same reputational effects between the time period examined by KLW and the more recent time period we analyze. This general insight motivates our scientific replication, which allows us to address two primary questions. First, are the estimated losses in value that firms experience subsequent to environmental violations in the more recent time period similar to the period covered by the original study? Second, are the estimated reputational penalties associated with environmental violations in the more recent time period negligible as in the earlier period? An understanding of the extent to which the market penalizes firms for environmental violations in the more recent period is policy-relevant and contributes to a broader literature on enforcement and compliance within law and economics and environmental economics.====Relative to the time period analyzed by KLW, 1980 to 2000, the results from our scientific replication using more recent data show that (1) firms experience less negative abnormal returns associated with announcements of environmental violations, and (2) while larger in absolute terms, fines and remediation costs comprise a smaller portion of firms’ market values. The net impact of these effects is negligible reputational penalties in the more recent period, as in the earlier period. These results suggest that the deterrence of environmental infractions continues to rely heavily on formal legal penalties, compared to other forms of misconduct in which market participants may assess significant reputational penalties.",Reputational penalties for environmental violations: A pure and scientific replication study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818302291,March 2019,2019,Research Article,209.0

The probability of each of these errors occurring depends largely on the standard of proof chosen by the law enforcer (==== the minimum degree of certainty the court has to reach in order to convict a defendant). Raising the standard of proof makes type 1 errors less likely and type 2 errors more likely. In U.S. criminal courts, the standard of proof currently used is “beyond any reasonable doubt”, while in quasi-civil cases (such as the termination of parental rights or psychiatric internment) judges apply the “clear and convincing evidence” standard, which is still higher than the “preponderance of evidence” standard used in civil cases. The “beyond any reasonable doubt” standard is reached if no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime. It is commonly admitted that this standard roughly corresponds to a degree of certainty of 95–99% that the defendant is guilty, while the “clear and convincing evidence” and the “preponderance of evidence” account respectively for 65–75% and 50% degree of certainty (Guerra et al., 2017, Rizzolli, 2016).==== Such a high level of standard used in criminal cases seems to indicate that more emphasis is placed on avoiding wrongful convictions rather than erroneous acquittals, as individual freedom is at stake.====Despite this high standard of proof, errors and notably wrongful convictions still exist. For instance, Risinger (2007) puts the proportion of wrongful convictions in capital murder-rape at between 3.3% and 5%. It is estimated that at least 2.3% of death sentences are wrongful convictions (Gross and O’Brien, 2008).==== However, the standard public law enforcement theory, where the two types of error have the same marginal effect on deterrence, hardly justifies a high standard of proof. The issue is even more involved when it comes to offenses which have been obviously committed.====Indeed, crimes that leave no room for doubt whether they have actually been committed or not raise new issues regarding the standard of proof. For such crimes, the answer to the question “was there actually an offense?” is positive and straightforward. In the context of such crimes, wrongful convictions are due to mistakes of identity (ID errors) rather than mistakes on the actual occurrence of the offense. A mistake of identity is defined as an error such that an individual is punished for someone else's crime; while the criminal escapes the sanction. This happens when the prosecution system holds somebody responsible for a crime, but this is not the right person. This remark seems to plead for a higher standard of proof since ID errors are associated with false negatives, and are doubly harmful.==== On the other side, ID errors affect the entire population equally, that is both the offenders (of another crime) and the non-offenders. Therefore, and as shown by Lando (2006), while erroneous acquittals reduce deterrence, wrongful convictions do not.==== This provocative result seems to favor the lowering of the standard of proof for obvious crimes with regard to deterrence concerns. In our paper, we show that, while not affecting the deterrence threshold directly (Lando, 2006), ID errors induce a new legal risk for the society, justifying (under certain conditions) a higher standard of proof.====We investigate how ID errors affect the optimal standard of proof when punishment is costly (such as imprisonment). We assume in our model that an individual's decision to engage in an illegal activity affects the entire population by raising the probability of being found guilty for someone else's crime.==== In other words, when committing a crime, an offender generates a negative externality through mistakes of identity (in addition to the classical externalities: the harm produced and the expected social cost of imprisonment if he is convicted).====In this context, raising the standard of proof has two simultaneous effects: (i) decreasing the probability that an individual is convicted for each crime committed (allowing some savings in the expected punishment costs), and (ii) decreasing deterrence (inducing an increase in the expected punishment costs).====Let us take an example. Assuming that a crime has obviously happened, such as a bank robbery (Lando, 2006), the law enforcement authorities may not collect enough evidence against any suspect.==== Else, they may detect and convict the guilty party (rightful conviction), or an innocent person==== (wrongful conviction due to a mistake about the identity of the offender). The latter situation is concomitant with the real culprit escaping punishment.==== Imagine the law enforcer decides to increase the standard. If somebody is convicted, it is more likely to be the guilty party (rightful conviction). However, raising the standard of proof may raise the probability of not collecting enough evidence against any suspect. Moreover, deterrence is diluted with the consequence that a larger proportion of individuals may decide to take their chance and rob a bank. This in turn creates more situations where an innocent person may be wrongfully convicted. However, since the amount of evidence required to convict someone is greater, this probability of ID error is lower for a given crime.====This paper is related to the vast law and economics literature on legal errors, deterrence, and the standard of proof.====The standard model of public law enforcement (Garoupa, 1997, Kaplow, 1994, Polinsky and Shavell, 2000) generally assigns the same marginal impact on deterrence of both wrongful convictions and wrongful acquittal. This common view is generally attributed to Png (1986), and seems to be confirmed by experimental studies (Rizzolli and Stanca, 2012).==== However, if this thesis is true and if the social cost of crimes is solely related to the resulting harm, then both types of errors should be equally costly (Nicita and Rizzolli, 2014, Rizzolli and Saraceno, 2013, Rizzolli, 2016). As a consequence, the trade-off between the cost of these two kinds of errors should result in an optimal “preponderance of evidence” standard of proof, even in criminal trials. But this argument does not support the existence of a strong bias against type 1 errors (pro-defendant bias) observed in criminal courts regarding the standard of proof (“beyond any reasonable doubt”), when compared to the one used in civil courts (“preponderance of evidence”) or in administrative courts (“clear and convincing evidence”). In order to explain these different standards, some authors such as Miceli (1990), Miceli (1991), and Lando (2009) have used fairness arguments to justify a type 1 error being considered more costly than a type 2 error. Setting (exogenously) the cost of a type 1 error higher than the cost of a type 2 error is consistent with the principle laid down by Blackstone (1766): “better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer”.====However, and according to Rizzolli and Saraceno (2013), assuming that the two errors have different weights is tantamount to using “==== assumptions to the model to adjust for the reality”.==== Several papers have tried to explain this pro-defendant bias endogenously. Among them, Rizzolli and Saraceno (2013) show that the higher social cost of type 1 errors relative to type 2 errors may be explained by the positive costs of punishment. By the same line of argument, Posner (1998) argues that a higher standard of proof is used in criminal trials because imposing a sanction is costlier in this context, relative to the cost of a sanction in civil trials (==== imprisonment ==== monetary fines). A second explanation for these different standards comes from Nicita and Rizzolli (2014), who show that the high standard of proof used in criminal courts may be the result of various behavioral hypotheses (such as risk aversion, loss aversion, and non-linear probability weighting). A third explanation comes from Kaplow, 2011a, Kaplow, 2011b and Mungan (2011), who show that the asymmetric costs associated with false convictions and erroneous acquittals may be explained by the choice of non-criminals to engage in costly precautionary activities (or equivalently abstaining from beneficial activities, or benign acts) in order to avoid false convictions, resulting in an increase in the cost of a type 1 error relatively to the cost of a type 2 error. As explained by Lando and Mungan (2017), this result is related to that of Craswell and Calfee (1986) and Shavell (1987). In presence of a wrongful conviction, the potential defendant may choose a level of care higher than the socially optimal one, reflecting overdeterrence. This result occurs when the choice is no more binary (committing the offense or not) but for instance continuous (Rizzolli, 2016).====In a context in which punishment is costly for society, our model provides an additional explanation to the fact that we observe a high standard of proof in criminal courts. Our explanation rests on the nature of the offense and the relation that exists in this case between an erroneous acquittal and a false conviction. More specifically, we focus on obvious crimes for which a mistake of identity (ID error) may arise: when an individual is punished for someone else's crime, the criminal escapes the sanction.====In recent years, a debate has emerged over the influence of ID errors on deterrence in the case of obvious crimes such as murders or robberies. In a breakthrough paper, Lando (2006) argues that the view of Png (1986) (erroneous acquittal and wrongful conviction playing an equal role) may be inaccurate since ID errors affect law-abiding and non law-abiding individuals indifferently. This result has been discussed by Garoupa and Rizzolli (2012), who show that ID errors do lower deterrence, since both errors are linked by an equilibrium constraint between demand and supply of mistakes. Lando and Mungan (2017) recently review the effect of type 1 errors on deterrence, with a focus on ID errors.==== Our paper is closely related to both Lando (2006), Lando and Mungan (2017) and Garoupa and Rizzolli (2012). In our framework, since ID errors affect law-abiding and non law-abiding individuals indifferently, the direct impact of those mistakes on deterrence is null. However, we assume that false negative errors and ID errors are related, since an ID error implies that the guilty escapes the sanction.====The contributions cited above generally abstract from the standard of proof. We take the next step by analyzing the effects on the optimal standard of proof in order to answer two questions: (1) How does the probability of an ID error affect the behavior of potential offenders? (2) How does the probability of an ID error impact the optimal standard of proof, and what policy implications can be derived?====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the framework. In Section 3, we specify the social welfare function, and the socially optimal standard of proof is derived in Section 4. We study the effect the existence of mistakes of identity has on the optimal standard of proof in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",Identity errors and the standard of proof,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818303260,March 2019,2019,Research Article,211.0

We show that a model in which adolescents go through a process of self-discovery and the costs and benefits of risky behavior (such as engaging in a criminal act) are revealed to them through ==== can replicate the pattern of initiation and desistance in such conduct typically observed in the data. In this setting, farsighted individuals have an incentive to experiment with risky behavior to resolve the uncertainty over their personality; contrary to popular belief, this means that a greater concern for the future may be linked to a stronger incentive to pursue risky activities at a young age. We also show that while stigma reduces the incentive to experiment, its effect on the prevalence of risky behavior is ambiguous. We discuss how imperfect self-knowledge may interact with other factors associated with risky behavior over the life course, including increasing penalties for repeat offenders and self-control problems.","The prevalence of many types of risky “anti-social” behaviors tends to increase during adolescence and early adulthood. For example, the prevalence of many criminal activities increases in late childhood, peaks in the late teenage years and then declines with age, first rapidly and then more slowly. This pattern, known as the age-crime curve, is observed for many types of crimes, across genders, countries, and historical periods. Similarly, substance abuse, involvement in fights and car accidents, and risky sexual activities all tend to peak during the teenage years. In this paper we propose a link between risk-taking during adolescence and imperfect self-knowledge.====Our theory begins with the observation that certain aspects of a decision-maker's personality (i.e. his own preferences and abilities) may be unknown at a young age but revealed through experiential learning. For instance, only experience can pin down at a personal level the altered state of consciousness induced by consuming recreational drugs, the pleasure derived from risky sexual activities, or the thrill of driving at high speeds. In the context of criminal activity, the decision-maker's emotional responses to the act of committing a crime (e.g. the fears and thrill of committing a crime, the level of empathy towards the victims, or the psychic-moral costs) and the direct costs of crime (e.g. the arrest and incarceration experience, the parents’ punishment) are likely uncertain for those who have little experience with crime. As a final example, one's own ability to commit a crime and to avoid detection may only be learned through experimentation.====Based on this insight, we show that a simple model that incorporates learning about one's own personality can replicate the observed pattern of risky behaviors. In our model, as individuals reach physical maturity they begin considering the expected costs and benefits of risky actions based on their unknown personal characteristics. This random rate of entry generates an initial spike in risky behaviors. However, as the outcomes of those experiences are realized, adolescents learn about their personalities, they re-evaluate the expected costs and benefits, and in many cases they desist from those activities as a result of the re-evaluation.====Our model of identity discovery neither abandons the idea of rational decision making nor assumes myopic behavior. In fact, we demonstrate that imperfect self-knowledge together with non-myopic preferences generate an incentive to experiment above and beyond the standard economic incentives. The intuition is simple: Even if the immediate expected return from a risky activity is negative, a farsighted individual that is uncertain of his abilities and his aptitude to withstand risks may be willing to experiment with risky options, trading off short-term expected losses for the possibility of obtaining higher long-term rewards if he discovers that his identity is conducive to undertaking high-risk activities (e.g. a personality conducive to criminal activities due to high ability to avoid detection, high tolerance to withstand incarceration, or high thrill generated by new sensations). This sort of endogenous path to identity development has been emphasized in developmental psychology research.====While our results are general enough to capture any of the experimentation motives mentioned above, we focus our analysis on the case where a “bad” experience (e.g. detention at a juvenile center, a physical injury or a disease as a result of the risky behavior) serves as a triggering event for learning conclusively about one's identity. Specifically, we conceptualize a typology of risk-taking personalities based on the personal perception of the negative outcomes of the risky actions. For some a risky choice that turns out badly is perceived as a significant harm and at that point turn away from the risky behavior, while others are capable of withstanding the harm relatively easy and continue with their risky behavior (as long as their safe and/or legal opportunities remain dominated by the risky alternative). In this framework, we characterize explicitly the prevalence of the risky behavior (e.g. the crime rate) in the cohort and present several interesting comparative static results.====As an extension of our basic model, we study a scenario in which the risky behavior has a chance of permanently lowering the return from the safe/legal alternatives, a situation which we interpret in the context of criminal activities as incarceration stigma (other examples include contracting a sexually transmitted disease and the stigma attached to drug addictions and teen motherhood). In this context, non-myopic individuals will have lower incentives to experiment. At the same time, we show that stigma increases the recurrence of the risky behavior (e.g. generates higher rates of recidivism) as some individuals find themselves trapped by the lower opportunities. Hence, the overall effect of stigma on the prevalence of risky behaviors during adolescence is ambiguous. We also discuss how increasing penalties over the life course and limited self-control affect the incentives to experiment and continue with risky antisocial behaviors.====The article proceeds as follows. In the next section we provide a brief review of the related literature. Section 3 presents the basic model and the main results. Section 4 presents the extensions mentioned above.

The main reason for this perplexity is that there is no tally of how many illegal trading activities are actually taking place. To solve this problem, this study proposes to use pre-announcement price run-up as a proxy for measuring the effectiveness of an insider trading law. After examining mergers and acquisitions data from Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission from 2003 to 2016 and adjusting for market effect, we arrive at an average cumulative abnormal return of 6.62% before the official announcement of the events. This constitutes a 58.9% run-up compared with the post-announcement price increase.====This investigation is important because it is the first to suggest an objectively empirical observation that approximates the overall size of illegal insider trading activities in a market. This method could serve as a sensitive tool for measuring temporal changes brought about by different legal arrangements within a single country or for measuring comparatively across different legal regimes.","Insider trading law has been a serious headache in securities law ever since its inception. The vexation comes from both the debates on the theoretical level==== and its application and enforcement. Suppose we accept the desirability of an insider trading law, then the next question that follows, is “How well is an insider trading law performing?” This is a twofold question. On the normative side, it relates to the search for a proper standard for deciding the goal or quality of an insider trading law, be it trading fairness or stock price efficiency. On the practical side, it requires developing an adequate empirical tool to measure how well an anti-insider-trading law performs.====This study uses pre-Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) abnormal price run-ups as a measure of the quality of insider trading law and its enforcement. In theory, pending M&A activity has a strong potential to induce substantial price movement in the public market after its announcement. Therefore, abnormal run-ups ==== the announcement of an M&A reflect a possible information leak. The signs can be used to test the effectiveness and quality of an insider trading law and its enforcement. Pre-announcement price run-ups, along with volume change and other company characteristics, provide a chance to better understand insider trading law, its enforcement, and the surrounding market structure and associated trading behaviors.====Pre-M&A abnormal price run-ups serve as useful metrics for assessing insider trading laws in two related setting. First, diverse insider trading laws in different countries can be analyzed and compared across borders. This is critical because cross-jurisdictional comparison is extremely difficult due to the complexity inherent in coexistent market designs and different stages of market development. Second, to a modest extent, pre-M&A abnormal price run-ups serve as a sensitive tool to measure temporal changes brought about by different legal arrangements within a single country and to quantify the changes or impacts. Therefore, they help to focus on the cost and effect of law and its enforcement. Such approach provides a direct look into how an insider trading law actually functions in a real-world scenario. In addition, it offers a potential means to settle these theoretical disagreements.====This study uses M&A data from Taiwan as a test case. Leveraging data collected from Taiwan’s Market Observation Post System, an electronic market information bulletin administered by the Financial Supervisory Commission since 2003, we test the pre-announcement adjusted price changes of M&As in Taiwan to gauge the potential size of insider trading and the effectiveness of Taiwan’s insider trading law.====Taiwan is now the 22nd largest economy in the world.==== It started a stock exchange in 1961, and insider trading has been prohibited criminally by the securities law since 1988. Although several amendments later strengthen the prohibition and increase the penalties (in 2000, 2004, 2012), the effectiveness of prohibition is less clear.====Several normative as well as practical implications make Taiwan a suitable example for an insider trading study. First, insider trading law enforcement struggles with a low conviction rate==== and a prolonged trial process (five years are considered short and a protracted case can last fifteen years in district court, high court and the Supreme Court combined). This poses problems when people try to form a proper view of the whole system, both substantive and implementation-wise, in the area of insider trading law.==== Second, on the market side, the Taiwanese stock market has been dominated by midsized companies, and a large portion of the companies have a concentrated ownership structure. Two variables have made the status quo more complicated: First, the trading patterns on the Taiwanese stock market has been changing (from a market dominated mostly by individual investors to more institutional investors).==== Second, the fiduciary commitment of professional corporate managers, a duty required by law but not the one necessarily prioritized in practice, is also growing but relatively uncertain. We want to examine how these features play out in their relations to the inside trading activities in the comparative law context. Lastly, the dark figure of illegal insider trading activities fundamentally hamper an adequate assessment of the quality of insider trading law and its enforcement, which is a general feature shared by almost all jurisdictions equipped with insider trading prohibition.====All these theoretical and contextual complexities in insider trading law justify a new quantitative approach that is different from the approach taken in more traditional studies. This study takes a streamlined method to answer a rather complicated but fundamental question: How do we decide the merit, quality, and effect of an insider trading law?====The rest of this study proceeds as follows.

In this article, we present the results of an empirical study comparing a highly salient aspect of securities enforcement—insider trading—in Canada and the United States. We reach a number of important findings. First, adjusting for trading volume, Canada has a greater intensity of enforcement when compared to the U.S. Second, Canadian securities regulators primarily concern themselves with insider trading in Canadian companies, while the SEC brings more enforcement actions involving insider trading in companies incorporated outside the U.S. Third, we do not find significant differences in the fraction of actions involving multiple traded companies between Canada and the U.S. However, we do see that U.S. investigations involve a significantly greater number of defendants and that the SEC is more than twice as likely to pursue tippers or tippees (although we observe no significant difference in the likelihood that top insiders will be pursued). Fourth, we find that U.S. cases are significantly more likely to result in a criminal referral leading to prosecution. Fifth, we find that settlements are more likely in the U.S. Finally, in terms of monetary penalties, we find no significant difference between the two countries. However, we do find that Canada is more likely to apply a bar as a ====, but if a bar is applied, the U.S. is more likely to make the bar permanent. These findings neither demonstrate a need for systemic reform in either jurisdiction nor suggest that centralized regulation is more effective from an enforcement perspective. But, they do provide insight into the differing points of regulatory emphasis in two jurisdictions. From a comparative perspective, our research invites securities regulators to evaluate whether their enforcement approach is optimal on the basis of quantitative data.","The securities markets of Canada and the United States are closely integrated. A significant number of public companies are listed on stock exchanges in both countries, encouraged by coordinated disclosure and offering requirements that facilitate capital raising on both sides of the border. One aspect of securities regulation, however, remains largely distinct: enforcement. Although provincial securities regulators in Canada have entered into memoranda of understanding with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate investigations involving conduct in both countries, the enforcement regimes remain separate.==== Moreover, the two countries have different regulatory structures, with provincial and territorial securities commissions playing the principal role in Canada, whereas the SEC overshadows state securities regulators in the U.S. These differences in regulatory structure invite a comparison of the two approaches. Moreover, there is a long-standing and lively debate in Canada over whether to move to a national or “cooperative” regulator, modeled to some extent on the SEC. This debate, however, suffers from a dearth of empirical evidence comparing the two alternative regulatory models.====In this article, we present the results of an empirical study comparing a highly salient aspect of securities enforcement—insider trading—in Canada and the U.S. The SEC has greater resources, greater economies of scale, and more experience in bringing insider trading actions. These factors suggest that the SEC will have the capacity to bring more insider trading actions than its Canadian counterparts. In order to test this and related hypotheses, we identified insider trading enforcement actions brought by provincial securities regulators in Canada and by the SEC in the U.S. from 2005 to 2015. For these actions, we collected data on industry, number and type of defendants, time to resolution, and sanctions imposed. Our data are cross-sectional in nature and thus, our findings are largely based on correlations. Nonetheless, we believe that our findings mark a first step in assessing differences and similarities in Canadian and U.S. insider trading enforcement.====We find, unsurprisingly, that the number of actions is much larger in the U.S., reflecting its larger economy and the size of its capital markets. But when we examine the numbers relative to the amount of trading, the intensity of enforcement in Canada looks considerably greater, inconsistent with our hypothesis that the SEC will bring its greater resources to bear in pursuing insider trading cases. However, Canadian securities regulators primarily concern themselves with insider trading in Canadian companies, while the SEC brings more enforcement actions involving insider trading against foreign incorporated companies listed in the U.S.====This article contributes to the developing body of empirical scholarship studying enforcement actions in securities regulation. Much of the existing literature focuses solely on the U.S., including studies on: the interaction between public and private enforcement;==== the role of scandals and other forms of public pressure on enforcement decisions at the SEC;==== the SEC’s choice between enforcement in civil court or before an SEC administrative law judge;==== the incentives of SEC enforcement attorneys;==== the accuracy of enforcement statistics put forth by the SEC;==== the role of lead plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ attorneys in shareholder litigation;==== the characteristics of securities class actions against bankrupt companies;==== the role of auditors in settlements and securities class actions;==== and the presence of frivolous lawsuits and the impact of reforms to combat such lawsuits.==== Missing from this literature, however, is a comparative analysis of enforcement across borders as well as an empirical study of insider trading enforcement in Canada. This study offers a unique contribution in this regard, providing original data from the SEC and provincial securities commissions in Canada.====We proceed as follows. Part 2 provides background on the regulatory regimes in Canada and the U.S., with specific reference to insider trading. Part 3 develops our hypotheses. Part 4 presents the results of our empirical tests. Part 5 offers analysis of the results and concluding thoughts on the policy implications of differing approaches to securities regulation in Canada and the U.S.",An empirical comparison of insider trading enforcement in Canada and the United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818301844,March 2019,2019,Research Article,215.0

Specifically, this study will examine the impact of a change in CCW status from “prohibited” to “shall issue” on murder rates. Using a synthetic control method, results of the present study suggest that only in New Mexico did the move from “prohibited” CCW status to “shall issue” CCW status result in an increase in murder rates and gun related murder rates. For the remaining states, the change in CCW status had no effect on murder rates. As a robustness check on the results found using the synthetic control method, a ==== was also estimated. These results indicate that states that changed from “prohibited” to “shall issue” experienced a 12.3% increase in gun-related murder rates and a 4.9% increase in overall murder rates. It is important to note that none of the results in the present study indicate that a move from “prohibited” to “shall issue” CCW status may result in a decline in murder rates.","There is a common belief among gun rights proponents that firearms should be readily available to the general public in order to promote deterrence. According to this argument, criminals would be less likely to commit crimes if they believed that their victims or innocent bystanders may be armed. This deterrent effect has been discussed at great length in many prior studies (Kovandzic and Marvell, 2003; Kovandzic et al., 2005; Lott and Mustard, 1997). Gun control proponents, however, believe that, by increasing the supply and availability of firearms, the probability that a crime will be committed also increases. Most gun control proponents fear that minor altercations may become violent and deadly if more people are armed.====One of the more prevalent and important types of gun control measures that may affect the overall availability of firearms is the concealed carry law. Concealed carry (CCW) refers to the carrying of firearms in a concealed fashion. Laws regulating the concealed carry of firearms differ substantially between states and have changed quite significantly over the past thirty years. There are no federal laws regulating the concealed carry of firearms.====There are four broad types of state-level CCW laws (Barati, 2016; Donohue, 2003; Gius, 2014). The first is “unrestricted”; individuals in states with unrestricted access do not need a permit to carry a concealed handgun. For years, the only state that had no CCW restrictions was Vermont. The next type of CCW law is “shall issue”. In a “shall issue” state, a permit is required to carry a concealed weapon, but state and local authorities must issue a permit to any qualified applicant who requests one. “Shall issue” and unrestricted are considered to be permissive CCW laws.====The third type of CCW law is “may issue.” In a “may issue” state, local and state authorities can deny requests for concealed carry permits, even requests from qualified applicants. “May issue” laws restrict the ability of citizens to carry concealed weapons. Finally, the last category is “prohibited”; in years past, some states prohibited the concealed carry of firearms. As of 2018, there are no states that prohibit concealed carry.====Presently, the following nine states and the District of Columbia require a permit to carry a concealed handgun and are “may issue”: California, Connecticut (per statute; in practice “shall issue”), Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island (Barati, 2016; Donohue, 2003; Gius, 2014). The following six states do not require a permit to carry a concealed handgun: Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Vermont, and Wyoming (Barati, 2016; Donohue, 2003; Gius, 2014). All other states require a permit and are “shall issue” (Barati, 2016; Donohue, 2003; Gius, 2014).====It is important to note that these four categories of CCW laws are rather broad, and not all states within a given category are equally restrictive. These broad categories are not definitive because the way in which a state not only interprets CCW statutes but also enforces them has an impact on the actual restrictiveness of the law. In addition, some cities and counties have more restrictive concealed carry laws than their home states. Finally, it is important to note that permits to carry concealed firearms are required in both “shall issue” and “may issue” states. The only difference between these two types of CCW statutes is that, in “shall issue” states, the issuing authority must issue a CCW permit to any qualified applicant. In a “may issue” state, the issuing authority may deny a permit to anyone, even qualified applicants. Hence, the vast majority of states in the U.S. require a permit to carry a concealed weapon.====Regarding CCW research, Table 1 summarizes the findings of most of the research in this area over the past 20 years. As can be seem from this table, most studies found that permissive concealed carry laws (“shall issue” or unrestricted) either reduce violent crime or they have no significant effects on crime. Only two studies (Ginwalla et al., 2013; Ludwig, 1998) found that permissive concealed carry laws increase homicide rates. Some studies, such as Ayers and Donohue (2003), Donohue (2003), and Kovandzic and Marvell (2003), found that states with more permissive concealed carry laws had higher property crime rates. However, Devaraj and Patel (2018) found that property crime rates fell when Chicago went from “prohibited” CCW status to “shall issue”. Hence, most prior research has found that permissive CCW laws either reduce violent crime, or that they have no statistically significant effects on violent crime.====In one of the earliest studies on CCW laws, Lott and Mustard (1997) found that states with “shall issue” concealed carry laws had lower crime rates than states with more restrictive carry laws. They found that “shall issue” laws resulted in a 7.65% drop in murders and a 5% drop in rapes. Their research suggests that individuals would be less likely to commit crimes if they knew that others may be carrying concealed weapons. Much of the research that followed Lott and Mustard (1997) used the same type of model (log-linear) and the same type of data (county-level). In addition, most of these studies used panel data estimation techniques, weighted observations, and clustered standard error corrections.====One of the most recent studies on the relationship between CCW laws and crime is Barati (2016). In this study, the author used a difference-in-differences model in order to determine the effects of a change in state-level CCW status on various crime rates. Specifically, Barati (2016) attempted to determine if the effects of a “shall issue” CCW law differed depending on what type of law was in effect prior to the passage of the “shall issue” law. Using data for the period 1991–2008, the author found that switching from a “may issue” law to a “shall issue” law had no statistically-significant effects on any of the crime rates examined. However, when a state switched from prohibited to “shall issue”, then robbery, burglary, and larceny rates all fell. The change from prohibited to “shall issue” had no statistically-significant effects on motor vehicle thefts, murders, or aggravated assaults. A similar approach regarding the effects of a change in CCW status from “prohibited” to “shall issue” is employed in the present study.====The purpose of the present study is to determine the relationship between concealed carry laws and state-level murder rates. Specifically, this study will examine the impact of the change in CCW status from “prohibited” to “shall issue” on murder rates. The reason why this change is important is because, over the past 30 years, many states have loosened their CCW laws and have changed from “prohibited” to “shall issue”. In addition, as noted earlier, both “may issue” and “shall issue” states require permits for concealed carry. Therefore, a change from “may issue” to “shall issue” is not as significant nor as noteworthy as a change from “prohibited” to “shall issue”. Also, very few states, even today, allow unrestricted concealed carry. Hence, examining the impact of a shift to “unrestricted” carry on crime would be somewhat problematic. Therefore, the present study will attempt to determine the relationship between changes in CCW laws and state-level murder rates.====Another important distinction of the present study is that a synthetic control method will be used to examine the impact of this change in CCW laws. In most prior studies on this topic, a fixed effects model with panel data was used to estimate the relationship between gun control laws and crime rates. Although well-established in the area of policy analysis, fixed effects may not be the most appropriate statistical method to use in the analysis of the effects of gun control measures on crime. The results are highly dependent upon the time period being examined, and misspecification of the model may make it difficult to establish causal relationships between gun control laws and crime (Donohue et al., 2017). A superior and more appropriate statistical method for this type of analysis may be the synthetic control method. Only one other study used the synthetic control method to examine the impact of a change in CCW laws on crime rates (Donohue et al., 2017).====Results of the present study suggest that only in New Mexico did the move from “prohibited” to “shall issue” result in an increase in murder rates and gun-related murder rates. For the remaining states, the change in CCW status had no effects on murder rates or the results were inconclusive. As a robustness check on the results found using the synthetic control method, a fixed effects model was also estimated. These results suggest that states that shifted from “prohibited” to “shall issue” experienced a 12.3% increase in gun-related murder rates and a 4.9% increase in overall murder rates. It is important to note that neither the synthetic control method nor the traditional fixed effects model found that a move to more permissive CCW laws resulted in fewer murders.",Using the synthetic control method to determine the effects of concealed carry laws on state-level murder rates,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818301935,March 2019,2019,Research Article,216.0
