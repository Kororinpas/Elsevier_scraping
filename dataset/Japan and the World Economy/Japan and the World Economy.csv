Many regional banks predominantly focus on lending business in their local areas so that, unlike some previous literature, we control for the local ====. We found that, compared with the pre-QQE period, the BOJ’s government bond purchase has a remarkably greater impact on regional bank’s lending after the introduction of QQE. These results suggest that the QQE policy is quite effective in promoting bank lending. Regarding the differences in bank characteristics, the magnitude of impact is larger for regional banks with a higher ==== ratio, a larger asset size, and a lower market share. The first result is consistent with the findings of Bowman et al. (2015) and Matousek et al. (2019), whereas the second and third results are novel. The ==== produce consistent results.","After the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), the central banks of developed countries successively adopted unconventional monetary policies to pursue further monetary easing. Considerable attention has been devoted to the topic in academic literature (Cour-Thimann and Winkler, 2013, Bowdler and Radia, 2012, Gambacorta et al., 2014). The essential characteristic of unconventional monetary policies is a tool used by a central bank or other monetary authority that distinguishes from traditional measures. Although unconventional monetary policies came to prominence during the GFC, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) had already implemented such policy tools since the early 2000s====In March 2001, the BOJ introduced an unprecedented monetary policy experiment, commonly referred to as “quantitative easing (QE)” to stimulate the nation’s stagnant economy and overcome prolonged deflation.==== The BOJ decided to end the QE policy in March 2006 and switched back to target the overnight call rate as its policy instrument. However, the BOJ started the “quantitative-qualitative easing (QQE)” in April 2013 by the large-scale purchase of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and other financial assets. The main purpose of this policy was to achieve a two percent annual CPI inflation rate in the next two years. Additionally, the BOJ intended to encourage more bank lending to the private sector.====In academic literature, many studies have investigated the impact of QE on interest rates, asset prices, inflation, and output growth. In the case of the BOJ, several studies found that asset purchases of the BOJ have a significant effect on reducing the yields of government bonds (Kimura and Small, 2007, Oda and Nagahata, 2008, Ugai, 2006). Harada and Masujima (2009) and Honda et al. (2013) indicated that the BOJ’s QE policy increased aggregate output through asset prices and bank reserves. In contrast, less attention has been paid to the response of bank lending using bank-level data. Bowman et al. (2015) investigated the impact of first QE using bank-level data from 2000 to 2009 and found a positive response of lending to liquidity positions, which is more intense for weaker banks. Matousek et al. (2019) focused on regional banks and analyzed the interaction between the BOJ’s QE policy and banks’ assets and liabilities composition using data from 2000 to 2015. They found that small-sized regional banks with high values of non-performing loans (NPLs) holdings tended to increase their lending.====To investigate the impact of recent QQE on bank lending, we analyzed the individual regional bank data following Bowman et al. (2015) and Matousek et al. (2019), but extend the sample period to 2020. Many regional banks focus predominantly on lending business in their local areas, so, unlike Bowman et al. (2015) or Matousek et al. (2019), we control for local economic conditions. We newly discovered that the BOJ’s government bond purchases during the QQE have a considerably larger impact on regional bank lending than they did before QQE. These results suggest that the QQE policy is quite effective in promoting bank lending. Regarding the differences in bank characteristics, the magnitude of impact is greater for regional banks with a higher NPL ratio, a larger asset size, and a lower market share. The first result is consistent with the findings of Bowman et al. (2015) and Matousek et al. (2019), whereas the second and third results are novel. The Granger causality tests produce consistent results.====One major reason for us to focus on regional banks is that they play a leading role in performing the financial intermediation function in the Japanese financial system. Wang (2016) investigated how differences in financial structure have been responsible for differences in approaches to unconventional monetary policy between the BOJ and the Fed and argued that the role of banks in Japan is more relevant in the transmission of unconventional monetary policy because of the bank-based financial structure. Moreover, their line of business is quite different from that of large “mega” banks with nationwide branch network. Mega banks have been expanding their overseas businesses and increasing non-interest income since the mid-2000s to overcome a decline in loan demand due to the stagnation. In contrast, many regional banks still focus predominantly on lending business and are struggling against unfavorable business conditions such as shrinking population and prolonged stagnation of the regional economies. Regarding the severe business environment that Japanese regional banks face recently, Fukuda and Okumura (2021) examined the impact of population aging on regional deposit and loans. They argued that, in rural economies, deposits are expected to decline and to result in a shortage of funds in the near future. Kobayashi and Bremer (2022) examined regional bank reorganizations using the event study methodology from 2008 to 2019. They found that, within the prefecture, mergers might result in the oligopolistic local banking markets, leading to poorer services and higher fees.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the Bank of Japan’s non-traditional policy operations. Section 3 surveys the literature on the effectiveness of those policies and on the bank lending behavior. Section 4 describes the empirical methodology and the data. Section 5 presents and briefly discusses the empirical results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with some caveats.",The effects of quantitative easing policy on bank lending: Evidence from Japanese regional banks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142523000191,26 May 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

Yet, the ","Road transport is the second largest contributor of global GHG emissions today, accounting for roughly 16% of global GHG emissions and 22% of global carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions (Our World in Data, 2020). How best to control carbon emissions from driving of private vehicles continues to be a daunting and important task for policy makers worldwide (Anderson et al., 2011, Knittel, 2012). This manuscript attempts to draw some useful insight for transport-related climate mitigation policies by analyzing 25-years of data in Japan. In Japan, the average fuel economy ratings of passenger vehicles (cars and vans) have dramatically improved from 1990 to 2015 --- by a roughly constant rate of 13% each five-year period. Yet, vehicle CO==== emissions from households sharply increased from 1990 to 2000, after which they began to decline dramatically. Fig. 1 demonstrates this striking discrepancy between the trend in fuel-economy technology and that of vehicle CO==== emissions over this period. The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) and industry reports often claim that the emissions decline since 2000 is largely due to the improvement in fuel-efficiency technologies (mlit2021, Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, 2010). However, such an explanation fails to explain this disparity we observe in Fig. 1, leaving us the puzzle: What then explains the disparity between the two trends?====With this question in mind, this manuscript attempts to ==== decompose vehicle CO==== emissions from households over the 25-year period from 1990 to 2015, ==== consumer’s car ownership and utilization choices.==== Our approach is similar, in spirit, to Copeland and Taylor, 1994, Copeland and Taylor, 2003 and Shapiro and Walker (2018) in that the emissions are conceptually decomposed into three terms: scale, composition, and technique effects. We, however, differ substantially from them on several important accounts. First, we only study road transportation, and we do not explicitly build a general-equilibrium model of that sector. Instead, we only model consumer’s car ownership and utilization decisions explicitly, taking car prices, car model offerings, gasoline prices, and other economic factors as exogenously fixed at the observed levels. Hence, our model does not account for the changes in the economy-wide sector composition over time. Second, we account for changes in the ==== distribution of households’ endogenous automobile demand over time. Japan has experienced rapid demographic changes during the study period: The overall population peaked in 2008 while the share of the elderly (age 65 or above) increased from 12.1% in 1990 to 26.6% in 2015. Along with this demographic change, Japan has also witnessed a substantial migration of households during the same period. For example, the share of population living in six largest cities increased from 15.4% in 1990–16.9 in 2015. This change in the geographic distribution of households alone can potentially explain the observed patterns in vehicle CO==== emissions because the demand for vehicle transport differs substantially between urban and non-urban areas due to differences in public transit availability or other city structures.====With these in mind, we first start with the ==== decomposition of the vehicle CO==== emissions in a manner analogous to Copeland and Taylor (1994), yet tailor the definition of the scale, the composition, and the technique effects into our settings. We define the scale effect as the effect directly driven by changes in the ==== driving demand --- i.e., changes in the total vehicle kilometers travelled summed over all regions in Japan. The composition effect is defined as the effect of changes in the composition of driving demand across households, regions, and/or types of car holdings. The technique effect is then defined simply as the effect of changes in fuel efficiency technologies, which determines CO==== emissions per unit of driving, holding constant the CO==== emissions rate per unit of energy consumption. Hence, by definition, the scale and the composition effect must explain the puzzling discrepancy mentioned above.====We then attempt to ==== decompose the scale and the composition effects into ==== and ==== terms. To do so, we borrow from the discrete-continuous choice model developed and estimated in Konishi et al. (2021). The model is estimated on the detailed household-level dataset from a national internet survey conducted in 2016. The model builds on the conventional discrete-continuous choice framework (e.g., Bento et al., 2005, Bento et al., 2009, Dubin and McFadden, 1984, Goldberg, 1998, Jacobsen, 2013, West, 2004), but is unique in that it allows for parameters to depend not only on household and product attributes but also on regional attributes (public transit density, in particular). Hence, the model allows us to predict location-specific vehicle ownership and utilization rates as well as how they respond to changes in spatial demographic distribution over time.====We use census and GIS data to construct the distributions of age, income, household size, and public transit density ====. Consumer’s “choice set” is constructed and adjusted for each period (in a 5-year interval), based on the available car offerings for each interval, using catalog data on car prices and car attributes (fuel economy) as well as gasoline prices. The predicted shares of different car models and predicted annual driving distance for each municipality are then multiplied by the number of households for that municipality. We treat the number of households in each municipality in each year as exogenous, and we fix them at the observed level. Consequently, in our model, total driving demand changes partly due to purely exogenous changes in demographics and partly due to endogenous behavioral responses to exogenous factors (e.g., car prices, car attributes, gasoline prices, household characteristics, changes in public transit availability).====We have three important findings. First, contrary to our expectation, demographic changes cannot fully explain the scale and the composition effects. Changes in the total number of households (or driver’s license holders) and its spatial distribution across municipalities over time can only explain about half of the gap between the two trends in Fig. 1 over the 25-year study period. Second, we find that much of the remaining variation can be explained by endogenous demand responses due to improved fuel efficiency technology (roughly 87.2% of the gap); and if they were not considered, the prediction errors would be two to ten times larger. In other words, we can only explain the observed vehicle CO==== emissions after accounting for endogenous demand responses. It is important to emphasize here that we do ==== obtain this result by construction --- ours is not the ==== (or mechanical) decomposition of total variation; the endogenous term is predicted from the discrete-continuous choice model estimated on a separate study sample, not fit to the observed trends in CO==== emissions. Third and most importantly, of the endogenous demand responses, fuel economy improvements have the largest explanatory power, accounting for 16.9% of total variation. This means that, while improvements in fuel efficiency technology significantly reduce emissions ==== of driving, 60% of this reduction is offset by an increase in vehicle demand, in terms of both utilization and ownership, due to its effect of decreasing driving costs.====Our results have several important implications for optimal design of policies to control carbon emissions from road transportation. First, our results reinforce the key finding from the previous empirical studies on this topic, which echoes the conventional view held by many environmental economists: Optimal pricing of pollution, via the gasoline tax in this context, is critical, and without it, simply improving fuel efficiency of automobiles is unlikely to curtail vehicle carbon emissions effectively. We arrive at this with an approach quite different from the previous studies, however. The earlier studies estimate a behavioral model of household’s demand for automobiles, either using cross-section survey data on car ownership/utilization (e.g., Goldberg, 1998; Bento et al., 2009; Jacobsen, 2013) or using a panel of sales data over a relatively short period (e.g., D’Haultfœuille et al., 2014; Konishi and Zhao, 2017; Reynaert, 2021), and then use the estimated model to simulate the economic impacts of counterfactual policies. In contrast, we take the 25-years of aggregate-level vehicle CO==== emissions data in Japan, and use the micro-level (empirically estimated) behavioral model, in combination with the Copeland-Taylor decomposition, to test how much of the total variation in emissions over the 25-year period can be explained by the model. Thus, our approach is similar, at least in spirit, to Shapiro and Walker (2018).====Second, our work identifies two different sources of the perverse effect of lowering the user cost of driving (i.e., dollar per unit of driving distance), often known as the Jevons paradox. The empirical literature often focuses on the ==== of energy-saving investments (e.g., Small and Van Dender, 2007; Jacobsen, 2013; Linn, 2016; Yoo et al., 2019; Craglia and Cullen, 2020). That is, higher fuel efficiency reduces per-unit cost of driving, and hence may induce more driving. We also find evidence for another type of induced demand, however. That is, higher fuel efficiency increases the expected payoff from owning a vehicle ==== other transportation mode, and hence may induce a higher rate of car ownership. We find that both effects are important in explaining the vehicle emissions trend. This second type of induced demand is implicit in all studies cited above. However, ours is probably the first to quantify its sizable impact of the Jevons paradox over such a long-run time span.====Lastly, however, we also find that when the scale effect (or the effect of population size) tapers off, the technique effect (or the effect of technology improvement alone) starts to dominate. Although we do not formally explore its implication, this may imply that the effectiveness of technology-based regulation (e.g., fuel-economy regulation) may depend on whether the ==== demand is sufficiently saturated in a given country. In our context, the sizable Jevons effect arises precisely because the lower utilization cost due to the technological progress induces the higher demand for automobiles. In an economy with the flattening size of potential drivers, however, this Jevons effect may not be large because the inducible potential demand may be limited. In fact, we do observe similar U-shaped CO==== emissions trends for on-road transportation in Europe and in the United States. In contrast, in countries like India and China where there is still likely to be large unexploited demand for automobiles, incentive-based policies (e.g., carbon/gasoline taxes), which would raise the utilization cost, is likely to be more effective in reducing transport-related CO==== emissions than a technology-based regulation (e.g., fuel-economy regulation or subsidy to promote fuel-economy technologies).====This paper complements three strands of literature. First, there is a large literature that investigates, theoretically and empirically, the efficiency properties of alternative policies to control emissions from road transportation (Chen et al., 2021, Fullerton, Sarah, 2002, Huse and Lucinda, 2014, Klier and Linn, 2015, Yan and Eskeland, 2018, and other papers cited in Anderson et al., 2011, Knittel, 2012 or Anderson and Sallee, 2016). Second, there are empirical studies that attempt to quantify the economic and environmental impacts of fuel-economy regulation using the discrete-continuous choice model similar to ours (e.g., Goldberg, 1998, Jacobsen, 2013, Klier and Linn, 2012, Reynaert, 2021). Third, there is also a large literature in the non-economic journals that use statistical factor decompositions to explain changes in CO==== emissions over time (see papers cited in Long et al., 2021, Robaina and Neves, 2021, Shiraki et al., 2020). The approach we take in this paper builds on findings from all these strands of literature. We, however, take a step further. We use the empirically estimated behavioral model of discrete-continuous choice of car ownership and utilization, apply it in the Copeland-Taylor type factor decomposition, to understand the economic factors behind the long-run time path of CO==== emissions from road transportation over the 25-year period, 1990–2015.",Why is Japan’s carbon emissions from road transportation declining?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142523000208,24 May 2023,2023,Research Article,1.0

Compared with the forecast error of each country at the around same time, the forecast error of Japan is about 2 times larger. In case of Japan, even immediately before release of quarterly GDP, the forecast error is over 1 %, which is the same level of forecast error as 94 days before in the United States and 135 days before in Canada.====Evaluating the characteristics of forecast errors, it can be pointed out that Japan's forecasts are as efficient as those of other countries, and the addition of major economic statistics is unlikely to improve forecast errors. The reason for Japan's large forecast errors is the fluctuations in the GDP growth rate. These results provide evidence that volatile GDP may make the outlook worse.====Large fluctuations in Japan's quarterly GDP have already been pointed out. It is necessary to examine the factors behind the large fluctuations in the rate of change in Japan's quarterly GDP.","Quarterly GDP is a statistic that can systematically grasp the economy of a country and counts as important data to make policy decisions. However, it has traditionally faced trade-off issues such as estimation accuracy and early publication. According to newspaper reports, there are reports of doubts regarding GDP accuracy when the first preliminary quarterly GDP significantly differs from the forecast in advance. In addition, in the case of the second preliminary quarterly GDP, if it is significantly revised from the preliminary quarterly GDP, there are reports of doubts about GDP. This situation, although observed especially in Japan, is not unique to Japan.====Regarding the estimation accuracy, research has been conducted on international comparison of the revision in ex-post of quarterly GDP and whether the revision in ex-post can be predicted. Previous studies have shown that Japan has a higher range of revisions among OECD countries (Ahmad et al. (2004) etc.). Using a real time database for macroeconomic variables including GDP, Faust et al. (2005) indicates that it is quite difficult to predict revisions. The large revisions also make it difficult to predict true GDP.====On the other hand, regarding the first preliminary, GDP is announced with a lag of approximately 30–50 days after the end of the target quarter. For this reason, there are many previous studies on models that predict quarterly GDP on time and improve prediction accuracy, including nowcast predictions methods. Regarding the accuracy of the prediction model, previous studies on the prediction accuracy of GDP in each country and performance comparison of the prediction model have been conducted. Although there are many previous studies on the accuracy of new prediction methods through comparative studies with conventional prediction methods, there are not many comparative studies on prediction accuracy between countries. For quarterly GDP forecasts, high forecast accuracy is considered essential, but if there is a significant difference in forecast accuracy in terms of international comparisons, the issues maybe specific to one particular country in the forecast situation.====In this paper, we will examine the uniqueness of the forecast situation in Japan's quarterly GDP by comparing the forecast error in other countries. After confirming whether the prediction enhances the prediction accuracy, the cause of “the forecast error is large even with the optimum prediction” is examined. In the next section we summarize previous studies on the accuracy of estimation and prediction on quarterly GDP. Chapter 3 organizes the data used in this paper and we show an international comparison of quarterly and annual GDP forecast errors in Chapter 4.

Existing studies mainly consist of theoretical studies, but there are also some empirical studies. Regardless of whether it is theoretical or empirical, many studies on self-preferencing are concerned with the manipulation of search results and recommendation algorithms. Some recent studies have examined first-party selling by platforms that use proprietary transaction data collected from third-party sellers. However, little has been explored about other types of self-preferencing. Findings reported in the existing literature indicate that the impact of self-preferencing on consumers depends largely on the forms of self-preferencing and market environments, implying that policymakers need to gather relevant information on a case-by-case basis for better decision-making.

Several directions for future research are also proposed.","This paper presents a literature review of the recent research on dual-role platforms and self-preferencing by them to summarize the current findings reported in the economics literature on the competitive effects of self-preferencing.==== Based on this review, we outline several issues relevant to recent competition policy debates.====Recently, some platform operators have begun selling their products and services on the platforms they operate. Likewise, some sellers have started opening platforms to invite other sellers to sell products/services therein. Examples can be seen in many industries, including search engines (Google and Bing), online shopping malls (Amazon, Walmart, and JD.com), video game consoles (Nintendo, Sony Interactive Entertainment, and Microsoft), mobile app stores (Google and Apple), and online travel agencies (Expedia and Booking.com). These companies act as both platform operators and sellers in the platform. The literature has called them “dual-role platform” (Chen and Tsai, 2019, Kittaka and Sato, 2022), “hybrid platform” (Anderson and Bedre-Defolie, 2021, Etro, 2023), “vertically-integrated platform” (Padilla et al., 2022) and the like.==== Throughout this paper, we use the term “dual-role platform”.====From the platform perspective, having a dual role can be an effective business strategy. However, from the competition policy perspective concerns have been raised regarding dominant platforms’ use of dual roles. In particular, a prominent concern is about “self-preferencing” (i.e., platforms’ preferential treatment of their own products/services). Typical examples of self-preferencing include the manipulation of the order of search results and rankings in favor of platforms’ own products/services as well as the exploitative use of transaction data, which they have access to as the platform operator, for marketing activities of their own products. There is growing concern that these self-preferencing behaviors may have undesirable effects on the users of the platform, including consumers and sellers, which has provoked heated debates among competition authorities and researchers worldwide.====This paper reviews recent advances in the economics literature related to self-preferencing by dual-role platforms. By summarizing the findings reported from economic analyses, this study aims to provide guidance that would help competition authorities and regulators make policy decisions. Additionally, we hope this paper will help foster further discussion by clarifying issues that have not yet been addressed sufficiently in the theoretical literature and issues that should be considered to enhance further empirical investigations.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sections 1.1 Examples of dual-role platforms, 1.2 Examples of self-preferencing by platforms, 1.3 Competition policy issues, we provide several examples of dual-role platforms, introduce some specific self-preferencing behaviors and the responses of each jurisdiction to them, and describe the issues to be discussed from the perspective of competition policy. As a preparation before looking at the effects of self-preferencing, Section 2 reviews both theoretical and empirical studies about dual-role platforms. In particular, we discuss a platform’s incentives to play a dual role and their impact on platform participants (e.g., consumers and sellers). Section 3 focuses on self-preferencing behaviors by dual-role platforms. In particular, we review theoretical and empirical works focusing on the following two types of self-preferencing behaviors: manipulation of the order of search results and exploitative use of third-party data for marketing activities of first-party goods.

Consistent with predictions based on the resource-based view and agency theory, we find that family firms managed by non-family professional CEO successors are less innovative than those managed by family CEO successors or non-family firms. Further analyses indicate that limited access to family-based resources is a key determinant of the conservativeness of professional CEO successors. Our findings suggest the importance of the congruence of ownership and management in family firms due to CEOs’ access to family-based resources.","Leadership succession is a challenging and pivotal time for every company because the selection of a new CEO shapes the business organization, strategies, relationships, and capabilities of the firm for many years to follow (e.g., Helmich, 1975; Reinganum, 1985; Tushman and Romanelli, 1985; Greiner and Bhambri, 1989; Miller, 1993; Shen and Cannella, 2002, Shen and Cannella, 2003; Zhang and Rajagopalan, 2004, Zhang and Rajagopalan, 2010). This is especially relevant for family firms due to unique factors such as socioemotional factors, personal objectives, and family conflicts involved in the succession (Gómez-Mejia et al., 2001, Miller et al., 2003, Bennedsen and Fan, 2014). The focus on successors’ origin is also important because CEOs’ talent, personality and (self and social) identity matter for firms to be successful and thrive (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Bertrand and Schoar, 2003; Gibbons and Henderson, 2012a; Giorcelli, 2019; Bennedsen et al., 2020; Fladerer et al., 2021), especially after business succession, and in the case of family firms (Bennedsen and Fan, 2014, Amore et al., 2021). It is therefore important to answer whether family firms that have experienced a succession perform better or worse than non-family firms and whether family CEO successors outperform or underperform non-family CEO successors.====To answer these questions that are both theoretically and practically important, a number of studies have examined family firms after the CEOs’ succession from various dimensions: accounting and financial performance (Pérez-Gonzáles, 2006; Bennedsen et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2007; Cucculelli and Micucci, 2008; Saito, 2008; Chung and Luo, 2013; Chang and Shim, 2015; Amore et al., 2021); financial policies and capital expenditures (Fahlenbrach, 2009; Ellul et al., 2010; Amore et al., 2011); labor costs (Sraer and Thesmar, 2007, Bach and Serrano-Velarde, 2015, Amore et al., 2021); and ability/willingness to introduce technology-based, product and process innovation (Beck et al., 2011, Hauck and Prügl, 2015, Kraiczy et al., 2015, Werner et al., 2018, Zybura et al., 2021). However, there remains an important and unexplored performance dimension in the literature on family firms after succession: management innovation.====In the broadest sense, the notion of management innovation encompasses the development and introduction of new management ideas, practices, routines, and organizational structures intended to enhance the performance of the firm and deal with business opportunities and threats (Kimberly, 1981, Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Mol and Birkinshaw, 2009; Gebauer, 2011; Damanpour and Aravind, 2012). Numerous real-world examples indicate the importance of management innovation, e.g., the moving assembly line invented by Ford Motors; the statistical quality control pioneered by Western Electric; and the involvement of employees at the forefront in an ongoing process of quality improvement pioneered by Toyota Motors (Birkinshaw and Mol, 2006, Hamel, 2006). As Brea-Solís et al. (2015) suggest, Walmart’s impressive performance can be largely explained by its ability to innovate management during the company’s leadership transitions from Sam Walton to Lee Stott (in the study’s period), up to Doug McMillon. Empirical studies also show that management innovation has been a key source of competitive advantage for firms, influencing their operational efficiency, and dynamic capabilities (e.g., see the reviews by Bloom et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2015; Khosravi et al., 2019).====Given the critical role that top executives and cultural and relational factors play in the adoption of management innovations that are shared and well-received within the company at all hierarchical levels (Young et al., 2001, Birkinshaw et al., 2008), we expect that family-owned and/or family-managed firms have distinct preferences for management innovation. However, scant attention has been paid to the management innovation of these firms, which calls for new research on this subject.==== In this paper, we contribute to fill this gap by exploring whether family firms are more or less likely to introduce management innovation than non-family firms in the aftermath of a leadership change, by focusing on the origin of CEO successors as an important confounding factor.====Based on theoretical considerations, we test two hypotheses on the effect of the origin of CEO successors on whether family-owned firms are more or less likely to introduce management innovation than non-family firms. Firstly, based on the human capital perspective, we can predict that family firms managed by professional CEO successors are more likely to introduce management innovation after succession than those managed by family CEO successors. Family CEO successors are more disadvantageous than professional CEO successors in the family or non-family firms because of little attention to the human capital of family successors (Chandler, 1990, Lazonick, 1993, In, Bertrand and Schoar, 2006a, Bertrand and Schoar, 2006b, Caselli and Gennaioli, 2013) and their too close a relationship with founders that restricts their discretion (Mitchell et al., 2009; Quigley and Hambrick, 2012; Miller et al., 2003).====Secondly, however, agency and resource-based theories suggest that family firms managed by family successors are more likely to introduce management innovation after succession than those managed by non-family CEO successors. The relative advantage of family CEOs reflects the access to intangible family-based resources (Habbershon and Williams, 1999, Cabrera-Suárez et al., 2001), embeddedness with the business culture and organization (Arregle et al., 2007; Chung and Luo, 2013) and lower ownership-management agency problems (Miller et al., 2013) that increase their ability and willingness to initiate changes in the management style and practices. We investigate which of these predictions hold, and thereby how differences in the origin of CEO successors affect the likelihood of introducing management innovation within family firms and as compared with non-family firms.====We test these hypotheses using data of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from Japan. The focus on Japan is relevant because there are many family-owned as well as family-managed firms in Japan.==== In our analysis, we use data of 1162 SMEs that have experienced a CEO succession. We obtained these data from the Survey of Corporate Finance in Japan, a corporate survey conducted in 2014 by a group of researchers, including one of the authors of this paper. From the survey, we draw information on firms’ ownership structure, management and generation, and identify family versus non-family firms and family-managed versus professional-managed family firms after business successions. We also take advantage of the information on management innovation after the CEO succession from the survey. To operationalize the notion of management innovation, the survey asks for the introduction of management innovations related to the identification and exploitation of new opportunities in the incumbent business activities and other business fields (Gebauer, 2011, Harris et al., 2013). We run regressions on the determinants of the likelihood of this possible innovative behavior by CEO successors, and examine whether and how family ownership and/or family management affect the likelihood.====By way of preview, our results indicate that without conditioning the origin of CEO successors, family-owned firms after a CEO succession are not more or less likely to introduce management innovations than non-family firms that have also experienced a succession of leadership. However, when we take into account the origin of the CEO successor, we find that behind this null effect for average firms, there are heterogeneous effects within family firms depending on the origin. Specifically, family firms run by professional successors are less likely to introduce management innovation than non-family firms, while family-managed family firms are, on the contrary, equally likely to innovate management practices after the succession than non-family firms. These results are robust to different specifications.====Our results imply that the separation of ownership and management is harmful to family firms experiencing business succession by making them less willing to take innovative measures in managing the firms. This finding is consistent with both the agency theory, according to which family firms conducted by family CEO successors benefit from an alignment of interests between ownership and management (Miller et al., 2013), and the resource-based view of family firms, which views the “familiness” of the firm as a unique bundle of intangible, family-based resources and capabilities related to organizational culture, reputation, knowledge and connections that are, exclusively or predominantly, accessible to family members (Habbershon and Williams, 1999; Cabrera-Suárez et al., 2001; Huybrechts et al., 2011, Bennedsen and Fan, 2014).====To disentangle which of the two views are more likely to hold, resource based view or agency theory, we conduct a further analysis. In this analysis, we introduce two further conditioning factors that could affect the relative likelihood of family versus professional successors to introduce management innovation within family firms: the degree of family participation in the business ownership and the CEOs’ past working experience at the firm. On the one hand, the family CEO’s access to family resources should increase, and agency conflict should decrease, with the family ownership share. Thus, both the resource-based view and agency theory suggest that the likelihood of introducing management innovation increases with the family ownership share. On the other hand, we can draw from the two theories opposite predictions on the effect of the successor's past working experience, because the increase in access to family resources through the experience should be observed mostly for family CEO successors, while the mitigation of agency conflicts through the experience should matter mostly between family owners and non-family CEO successors.====Consistent with these predictions, we find a higher likelihood of introducing management innovation by family CEO successors for firms with a larger ownership share by family members. On the other hand, we find that a past working experience of CEO successors increases the likelihood of introducing management innovation by family CEO successors. These findings lend support to the resource-based view and not to the agency theory. Summing up, the findings in this paper indicate that there are beneficial effects of the integration of ownership and management on management innovation of family firms after CEO succession, and that the effects stem from the opportunity for family CEO successors to access the bundle of intangible, family-based resources and capabilities related to organizational culture, reputation knowledge and relationships.====Our study contributes to the literature on innovation and CEO succession of family firms by focusing on management innovation in the post-succession period and by comparing three types of firms, i.e., family firms managed by family CEO successors, those managed by non-family professional CEO successors, and non-family firms. Although there are a number of studies that focus on individual related aspects, i.e., quality of management practices and post-succession performance of family and non-family firms, very limited attention has been paid to management innovation of family firms in the post-succession period, and there has been no systematic comparison of post-succession management innovation within non-family counterparts (see Section 2 for a review of the literature). We also inform the debate on beneficial and detrimental effects of the family origin of CEO successors for firms’ performance by considering two important moderators (i.e., family involvement in ownership and successors’ past work experiences) that help to distinguish between the entrepreneurial human capital perspective, agency theory and the resource-based view.====Our findings do indicate that the three types of firms are different in terms of management innovation. Especially, the conservativeness of non-family successors at family firms in terms of management innovation—our main result—is in contrast to evidence from much of the existing literature that finds that the transfer of the CEO position from the family to professional managers enhances post-succession performance of family firms (Pérez-Gonzáles, 2006; Chung and Luo, 2013; Chang and Shim, 2015). Possible benefits of family involvement in management are attributable to the presence of a founding CEO premium (Anderson and Reeb, 2003, Villalonga and Amit, 2006), while the presence of family-descendant CEOs erodes value (Bennedsen et al., 2007, Cucculelli and Micucci, 2008, Saito, 2008). However, our finding of a greater propensity to innovate the firm’s management style, practices and structures by family CEO successors in the post-succession period is in line with recent evidence provided by Amore et al. (2021), who show that family firms experiencing a transition from a professional CEO back to a family CEO increase their profitability, and Zybura et al. (2021), who find that family firms run by family CEO successors are more likely to introduce product innovations after the transition.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the related literature and establish our hypotheses. Section 3 explains our data, and Section 4 describes the empirical strategy and the variables. In Section 5, we report the regression results.

However, a firm-level survey in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that foreign firms regarded digital communication as a key business obstacle. This paper estimates the determinants of the likelihood that foreign firms regard digital communication as an obstacle. The results show that digital communication is hindered by language differences, employees’ nationality differences, employment size, and time differences from foreign headquarters. Contrary to common assertions, digital communication is regarded as an obstacle in remote-work feasible sectors, but not so in in-person service sectors. Thus, digital communication does not completely eliminate barriers to face-to-face communication.","Digital technologies such as email, instant messaging, and online meetings have become key communication channels for firms and workers to collaborate and communicate at a distance. Triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual discussions in digital platform replaced in-person interactions as a daily platform for collaboration among workers even in proximity.==== Stringent travel restrictions reduced international flights for business travel, and digital technology became the dominant communication channel for collaboration across borders. The pandemic significantly increased face-to-face communication costs for international business activities, and thus highlighted the significant role of digital technology for communication in multinational firms.==== However, there is little systematic evidence on barriers to digital communication in multinational activities.====In this paper, I examine barriers to digital communication for multinational firms by using a firm-level survey on foreign firms in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first case of COVID-19 infection was observed in early 2020, the Japanese government took a wide range of measures to prevent the spread of infection, including an extensive request for companies to substitute remote work for office work. As the mobility of people in workplaces declined subsequently, a large number of workers substituted working from home (WFH) for office work and relied on digital technology for communication channels to collaborate with coworkers.==== Foreign-owned firms in Japan faced an exogenous strong shock to adopt digital technology for daily communication extensively among workers, clients, and their foreign headquarters.====In this unique setting, a survey was conducted on August 1, 2020, to collect information on foreign-owned firms in Japan. The questionnaire asks them about business issues to conduct a business in Japan if the impact of the COVID-19 continues. They were asked to choose top 3 answers from 10 options, including client/customer retention, getting new clients/customers, communication via digital technology, and so on. Although the options provided in the survey are not mutually exclusive, I define that foreign firms regard communication in digital platforms as an important issue when they answer digital communication as one of top 3 business obstacles from 10 options. To examine the relative importance of digital communication issues across industries, I calculate the sector-level share of firms that answered digital communication as an obstacle. The result shows that digital communication is more important obstacles for foreign firms in industries such as finance, insurance, and professional, scientific, and technical services. Meanwhile, it is less important obstacles for foreign firms in industries such as information, arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services.====To examine a question of which firms tend to regard digital communication as a key obstacle, I discuss a conceptual framework on barriers to digital communication in multinational activities. My assumption is that information and communication technologies (ICT) are suitable for processing codified and explicit information, whereas face-to-face interactions are efficient not only for communicating complex knowledge and intangible ideas but for increasing cooperation among workers (Gaspar and Glaeser, 1998, Storper and Venables, 2004, He et al., 2017). If virtual discussions in digital platforms do not completely remove existing communication barriers, digital communication issues should depend on communication barriers not only within firm organization, but to clients and customers in local and foreign markets. In terms of observable variables, within-firm communication depends on culture and language, employment size, time-zone differences between local subsidiaries and their foreign headquarters. Communication with markets depends on sales and marketing function in local markets and international transactions in foreign markets. Additionally, sector differences in remote work constraints and in-person interactions with customers can affect whether firms regard digital communication as an obstacle. To empirically examine these conceptual linkages, I estimate a logit model for the probability that foreign firms regard digital communication as an important business obstacle during the COVID-19 pandemic.====The main results are summarized as follows. First, foreign firms tend to regard digital communication as an obstacle when (1) they indicate English skills as business communication difficulties in hiring Japanese workers, (2) employ a smaller share of foreign workers, (3) employ a larger number of workers, and (4) face greater differences in time zones from their foreign headquarters. Second, foreign firms tend to regard digital communication as an obstacle when they have a stronger motivation for sales expansion and marketing in local markets. Meanwhile, digital communication issues have little correlation with exporting and importing, suggesting that digital communication should affect mainly domestic marketing activities. Additionally, foreign firms tend to regard digital communication as an obstacle in remote-work feasible sectors, whereas the intensity of face-to-face contact with customers has little influence on the likelihood that they regard digital communication as an obstacle. This result contrasts sharply with the common assertion that digital communication is effective for remote-work feasible sectors, but difficult for in-person service sectors. Overall, the results suggest that communication via digital technology still depends on existing communication barriers and thus does not completely eliminate barriers to face-to-face interactions among firms and workers.====This paper contributes to the limited literature on communication and multinational firms. Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott (2018) show that the availability of direct air links across countries significantly increases the number of foreign ownership at the global level through face-to-face interactions for business relationships. Tanaka (2019) shows that positive flight effects are significantly higher for Japanese multinational firms in sectors with more intensive face-to-face communication, which directly demonstrates a channel of face-to-face interactions between flights and multinational activities. By estimating the causal impact of international flights on multinational activities, these studies emphasize a role of face-to-face interactions for business relationships in multinational activities. This paper sheds new light on the role of digital technology communication in multinational activities, and systematically estimates the relative importance of barriers to digital communication for foreign subsidiaries by multinationals.====Based on a case-study approach, Lipiäinen et al. (2014) examine a Finnish multinational industrial corporation to examine the benefits and limitations of digital communication tools such as intranet, email, instant messaging, and blogs.==== The findings suggest that digital communication is advantageous for easy and speedy sharing of information among employees worldwide, but can cause miscommunication and misunderstanding for different attitudes, habits, and perceptions across employees. Because of this feature of digital tools, they highlight the importance of face-to-face meetings in daily internal communication. While the case-study approach provides insightful implications for digital communication, it is limited in terms of generality. In this respect, this paper provides quantitative evidence of firm-level constraints on digital communication by using firm-level data in Japan.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a background of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan during the first half of 2020, which should play a key role in determining whether foreign firms regard digital communication as a key obstacle in my survey data. Section 3 describes data sources and the relative importance of digital communication issues across industries. Section 4 shows a conceptual framework for the role of digital communication in multinational firms and specifies an empirical model to estimate the relative importance of communication barriers. Section 5 presents the estimation results with robustness checks. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",What hinders digital communication?

Corporate bailouts and the zombie firm problem are two sides of the same coin. A distinction is simply whether or not the bailouts is desired.==== Academically, however, nothing is certain to answer the following questions: What distinguishes corporate bailouts by main bank (hereinafter MBs) until 1970 from inefficient zombie lending? Were the problems of zombie firms in the lost decade caused by the deterioration of the MB relationship, which had worked effectively until the 1970 s, or were the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities inherent in the MB relationship simply revealed by the magnitude of the shock of the bubble economy’s collapse? Has shareholder discipline been effective in preventing inefficient bailouts since the mid-2000 s, when MB governance gave way to market governance?====To address these questions, we must generate long-term data for at least 50 years since the 1970 s using a unified framework in which the concept of “zombie firms” includes possible efficient bailouts. Moreover, we must analyze which firms became “zombie firms” being financially supported in terms of firm–bank relations and shareholder composition. By introducing a definition of “zombie firms” appropriate for this purpose and an analytical approach that addresses the issue of selection bias, this study uncovers the following facts: The presence of a MB with a loan ratio above a certain level increased the likelihood of a bailout in the 1970 s, but the prevalent belief about the MB’s monitoring power and the role of corporate groups and long-term credit banks is exaggerated. Pathologies identified during the lost decade, such as problem procrastination and unwilling concentration of loans to the MB, are more common in the manufacturing sector, whereas foreign investor discipline has only worked in the non-manufacturing sector. Since the mid-2000 s, soft budget constraints have continued in the manufacturing sector, in the sense that over-indebted firms that are no longer competitive with declining sales receive financial support as a legacy of the past.====The primary contribution of this paper is to visualize the dynamics of zombie firms from a very long-term perspective for the first time. In Japan, the zombie ratio of publicly traded firms has experienced three waves over the last 50 years. Unlike previous zombie firm studies, which only focused on the lost decade,==== our framework allows us to clearly understand the quantitative and qualitative relative relationships among the three waves. During the MB era, the wave was small, and the burden on the banks’ health was not so severe that they could intervene proactively and boldly to rescue financially troubled firms. In the second and largest wave of the lost decade, attention was solely focused on the problem of zombie firms in the non-manufacturing sector, which had a huge impact on banks’ health due to their large amount of borrowing, but the problem in the manufacturing sector was equally serious in terms of firm count. The structural problems in the manufacturing sector became clear in the third peak, following the Global Financial Crisis (hereinafter GFC), and approached the severity of the lost decade. However, the magnitude of the third peak was underestimated because the concentration of risk in the banking sector has been reduced compared to the past. The existence of the third peak is consistent with recent international research showing the emergence of zombie firms even in a market-centered financial system in response to aggressive monetary easing measures.====The second contribution is to dispel the stereotypical view of Japanese corporate bailouts and zombie firms, allowing for a consistent understanding over the last 50 years. Although all the dominant theories are reasonably consistent with the situation in each period, they fail to provide a consistent long-term view because the studies only cover about 10 years. Results of this study show that the presence of an MB with a loan ratio above a certain level increased the probability of bailouts in the 1970 s. Banks actively chose who would receive bailouts. However, in retrospect, they did not select superior companies to those that were not targeted for bailouts. Even if anecdotal stories about the success of MB corporate bailouts at that time were true, the widely held understanding that generalized them was quantitatively and qualitatively greatly exaggerated. The zombie firm problem of the lost decade’s three nonperforming loan (NPL) industries (i.e., construction, real estate, and wholesale/retail) simply indicates the impact of interest-bearing debt. Results reveal that the ratio of zombie in terms of the number of firms in the manufacturing sector was the same. MBs no longer took the initiative in bailout actions, and the procyclical nature of the Basel I regulation led further to pathological phenomena, such as procrastination of problems and unwilling concentration of loan to the MB as is well known. However, they were typically observed in the manufacturing industry, not in the non-manufacturing industry. The peak after the GFC was comparable to the lost decade in the manufacturing sector, albeit for a shorter time. The Financial Revitalization Program (commonly known as “Takenaka Plan”), which was introduced in October 2022 and required banks to dispose of bad loans and tighter financial supervision, was said to have ended the zombie firms’ problem. However, in the aftermath, firms became overly conservative in their investment and financial behavior, avoiding bank intervention and drastic reforms. In some ways, Takenaka Plan was sowing the seeds of the next zombie firms’ problem.====Overall, the findings of this paper challenge the conventional view that the zombie firm problem is a transitory phenomenon caused by an outdated, bank-centric financial system. Zombie firm issues arose not only in the lost decade but in both the 1970 s, when the MB relationship was functional, and since the late 2000 s, when the transition to market-centered governance occurred. They occurred whether banks and shareholders were actively involved in the bailout, and under both the tight monetary environment in the beginning of the lost decade and the strong easing measures after the GFC. Another contribution of this study is that it shows that zombie firms are not only a problem in the non-manufacturing sector but also frequently exacerbated in the manufacturing sector.====The existing literature has two major conflicting views on the evaluation of the MB relationship and the zombie firm problem of the lost decade, which have not been resolved since then. First, the MB relationship’s once-effective bailout function has deteriorated as the environment has changed, resulting in the zombie firm problem. In previous times, MBs disciplined firms as monitors based on their affiliation with the ==== business group, which originated from prewar ====, capital, and long-term business relationships (Hoshi et al., 1990). When firms were in financial distress, MBs quickly put together reorganization agreements with other creditors to reduce adjustment costs. In such cases, the MB provided funds and intervened in company management by sending executives to fill the missing external markets for corporate control (Sheard, 1989). However, if banks’ power over corporations declines and cozy ties form, this bailout function based on long-term relationships can quickly lead to “soft budget constraints” (Sheard, 1994). Hoshi and Kashyap (2004) discovered that managerial intervention by the MB decreased in frequency and effectiveness over time, based on case studies of financially distressed firms from the 1960 s to the early 1990 s. Meanwhile, Aoki et al. (1994) pointed out banks’ inclination to lend to speculative projects and exacerbate asset price bubbles as financial liberalization reduced lending opportunities to traditional customers. Such inclination demonstrates a deterioration in banks’ monitoring power. Peek and Rosengren (2005) empirically demonstrated in a seminal paper on bank misallocation of resources that the worse a firm’s financial condition, the lower the bank’s capital adequacy ratio, and the more the firm and bank belong to the same business group, the more likely the firm was to receive evergreen loans. Hoshi et al. (2018) examined how bank-led rescue operations in Japan have changed between 1981 and 2010 and found that the frequency and the intensity of restructuring by distressed firms has declined after the 1990 s, which can be interpreted as strong indicators of changing corporate governance in Japan, in particular in terms of the decline in corporate monitoring functions of main banks.====A few studies, however, are skeptical of the “myth” of MBs. For instance, Weinstein and Yafeh (1998) showed empirically that, even during periods of high growth, the growth and profitability of firms with high reliance on their MBs were not necessarily high. Hanazaki and Horiuchi, 2000, Hanazaki and Horiuchi, 2001 argued insufficiency of the evidence of the bank monitoring function’s effectiveness that has once existed. The MBs were able to embark on corporate bailouts not because they managed risk through appropriate information production, but because they were endowed with excess profits from the convoy system. Our empirical findings back up the latter point of view.====This paper focuses on key elements of the changes that have occurred in Japan's firm-bank relationship and corporate governance system over the past 50 years, particularly main banks, corporate bailouts, and zombie firms. It also discusses, in part, the impact of keiretsu business relationships and cross-shareholdings. In this respect, this study will serve as a complement to the literature that more comprehensively discusses the Japanese finance and corporate governance system. For example, with respect to the situation up to the 1990 s, the papers collected in Aoki and Saxonhouse (2000) cover a wide range of topics, including the role of securities markets, the government, and the legal system, and examine the background to the impasse of the once well-functioning Japanese economic system. Regarding the change of corporate governance and its impact in the lost decade, the papers compiled in Aoki et al. (2007) discusses the issues including corporate organization, employment, and boards with the perspective of institutional complementarities. In addition, Tomeczek (2022) uses a unique approach of text network analysis together with an extensive literature survey to clarify the function and evolution of the Japanese financial market and corporate governance system over a very long period of time since the Meiji era.====With regard to the background of excessive lending by Japanese banks, the impact of monetary policy, demographics, and mergers among financial institutions must also be considered. Shioji (2019) examined how banks increased lending in response to expanded reserves under quantitative easing in Japan. Fukuda and Okumura (2021) examined the impact of population aging on regional savings rates in Japan, with particular attention to the regional flow of funds. Uchino and Uesugi (2022) examined the effects of bank merger on unlisted firms' financing by focusing on firm-bank relationships. While each of these issues is important, they are beyond the scope of this study. The impact of those factors will be partially controlled for by year dummies in the following regression analysis.====Since FY 2020, which is beyond the scope of this paper, concerns have been growing that government support for firms damaged by COVID-19 would become a new source of zombie firms. Honda et al. (2023) and Hoshi et al. (2023), both of which examined the application of COVID-19 business support programs for SMEs in Japan, found that companies with low credit scores tended to use such programs even before the pandemic. Furthermore, Honda et al. (2023) concluded, based on the subsequent situation of firms that used the support programs, that such government support, while effective in preventing a surge in business failures, may have prolonged the lives of firms that were not viable in the long run.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the framework we used in the long-run analysis of this paper, which is based on empirical studies that have improved the method for identifying zombie firms. Section 3 examines the data from 1970 to 2019, focusing on changes in the zombie firm ratio and changes in corporate governance, such as MB relationships and shareholder composition. It also identifies issues for further investigation in the regression analysis. Section 4 describes the regression analysis framework and the explanatory variables used to elucidate which firms receive bailouts. Section 5 summarizes the main estimation results and discusses how to interpret them.

First, we show that overall commodity prices indeed tend to comove with economic activity. Second, we try to extract the global demand factor(s) using many commodity prices. While commodity prices reflect both demand and supply factors, by relying on a wide variety of commodity prices, supply shocks can be filtered out as they tend to be commodity-specific idiosyncratic shocks except for widespread supply disruptions confined to a few historical periods. In this paper, we then show that factors extracted from commodity prices movement contain useful information to nowcast and forecast global GDP and industrial production.","What do commodity prices tell us about economic activity? This paper analyzes the bountiful and rich information embedded in the prices of the many commodities traded in major commodity markets around the world and shows how this information is useful to nowcast or even forecast global economic activity.====There are at least two major reasons why commodity prices are useful indicators of global economic activity. First, even in a world where services take the spotlight, commodities still represent about 17% of global trade and are fundamental inputs into production.==== A change in global economic activity, by affecting the consumption of inputs into production, will therefore be reflected in the global demand for commodities (Barsky and Kilian, 2004; Alquist et al., 2020). Second, some commodities are storable, so, like those of financial assets, their prices reflect both current and expected future demand and supply conditions. Since many commodities are regularly traded in liquid and deep markets, their price can swiftly move in response to changes in market tightness, including news and changes in sentiment about global economic conditions.====In practice, it is not easy to infer economic activity from commodity prices. The presence of commodity supply shocks and commodity-specific demand factors are in fact prominent confounding influences==== or even reasons for reverse causality—especially in the case of oil, potentially introducing an element of countercyclicality (Hamilton, 1996, Hamilton, 2003). To tackle this problem, the analysis is split into two parts. The first part identifies commodity price cycles and provides insights into the cyclical synchronization between commodity prices and economic activity. The second part exploits co-movements among commodity prices to isolate global demand factors from other confounding influences and then tests whether the extracted global factors have nowcasting and predictive power for economic activity. Of course, this assumption has a limitation in the case of rare disasters (including wars) where various commodities suffer from supply disruptions as supply factors cannot be abstracted away using a large number of commodities.====This paper is related to a large body of literature on the co-movement in commodity prices. Existing studies differ according to the group of commodities that are investigated and the empirical methodology that are used, they generated consistent views: common factors extracted from a panel of commodity prices not only reflect some central characteristics of commodity prices, but are also strongly related to measures of economic activity (e.g., Byrne et al. 2013; West and Wong, 2014; Yin and Han, 2015; Alquist et al., 2020; Delle Chiaie et al., 2022). In the context of the oil market, there have been comprehensive analyses of oil prices and the co-movement of oil with other commodities. For example, Baffes (2007) estimated the pass-through of oil price changes to a wide range of commodities; Barsky and Kilian (2004), Kilian (2009), and Alquist et al. (2013) evidenced that non-fuel industrial commodity price movements reflect global demand that affects all industrial commodities. Our work is also related to a much smaller literature on forecasting using commodity prices. These papers include those that use common factors to forecast commodities prices themselves (e.g., West and Wong, 2014; Delle Chiaie et al., 2022), inflation (Gospodinov and Ng, 2013), and exchange rate (Chen et al., 2014).====This paper complements existing literature in three ways. Firstly, it contributes to the empirical evidence on the cyclical properties of commodity prices and the synchronization between commodities and economic activity in the past few decades. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to nowcast and forecast global GDP and industrial production using a bulk of high frequency commodity prices. We show that factor(s) from commodity prices can statistically improve nowcast and out-of-sample forecast results compared to a benchmark AR(p) process. Lastly, our nowcasting/forecasting exercise gives policymakers and practitioners a parsimonious framework to get a timely estimate of global economic activity.====In the following sections, we first analyze a few commodities and utilize the co-movement to nowcast and forecast the global economic activity. We also conduct some robustness checks before conclude.",Commodity prices and global economic activity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142523000038,11 March 2023,2023,Research Article,7.0
Yoshida Motonori,"Graduate School of Economics, Osaka Metropolitan University, Japan","Received 30 March 2022, Revised 20 February 2023, Accepted 1 March 2023, Available online 5 March 2023, Version of Record 11 March 2023.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japwor.2023.101178,Cited by (0),"Since the end of the 1990 s, the sluggish growth of Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP) and the mired fiscal state of its public sector have provoked consternation about its public sector’s fiscal sustainability. Therefore, I estimated the fiscal reaction functions (stemming from Bohn, 1998a, 2008) with time-varying parameters for all Japan’s government sectors (for 1976Q2–2020Q1), i.e., the general government (GG), the central government (CG), the whole of the local governments (WLG), and the whole of the social security funds (WSSF), to chronologically assess their fiscal sustainability using four different models, including a least-squares with breakpoints model and a state-space model with the Kalman filter. My results demonstrate that (1) the least-squares with breakpoints model outperformed the others, and (2) although CG, WLG, and WSSF often sustainably managed their ==== during the analysis term, GG has failed to implement a sustainable fiscal policy from the mid-1990 s (3) CG and WSSF adjusted their fiscal postures according to Japan’s economic state. Fiscal severity caused WLG to change its fiscal posture.","For decades Japan’s economy has simultaneously shown quite different aspects regarding its economic and public-sector fiscal states. First, Japan’s economic vitality has slumped. (1) Its year-on-year gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate has been relatively lower than most other G7 countries since 2001 and the worst since 2015.==== (2) Japan’s general government’s (GG’s)==== deficit/GDP ratio (%) averaged − 5.52 from 2010 to 2019, contrasted with − 0.91, which is the mean among all the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Japan’s GG net debt/GDP ratio (%) has also been the worst since 2008 among the G7 countries. ==== Fortunately, Japan’s economy overall presently enjoys the world’s best financial status: (1) it has maintained its current account surplus for the last 40 years (as of 2019); (2) it has the highest external financial asset balance (3340.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the world, as of 2019Q4 (Q denotes quarter).==== Taking all the above facts into account, Japan can efficiently extract itself from its dire public fiscal situation using the fertile financial capacity enjoyed by its economy. Fig. 1.====However, note that the fiscal state largely differs among public subsectors in Japan. The central government (CG) has a large primary deficit, unlike the whole of the local governments (WLG) and the whole of the social security funds (WSSF) (Fig. 2).==== Moreover, GG is comprised of CG, WLG, and WSSF, and its finances merely reflect the total outcome produced by each public subsector’s actions. Based on the expenditure/GDP ratios of all four government sectors, the total weight of WLG and WSSF in GG has remained basically identical to CG since 1991. Therefore, scrutiny of each public subsector’s behavior is critical for comprehensively understanding Japan’s public sector’s posture on its fiscal policy.====Based on the above context and situation, some studies assessed the fiscal sustainability of Japan’s government with Bohn, 1998a, Bohn, 2008 fiscal reaction function (FRF), i.e., examining the reaction of the primary surplus/GDP ratio (primary surplus = government revenue minus expenditure exclusive of interest payments on debt) to the increase of the government debt/GDP ratio. Ihori et al. (2001) did not verify Japan’s CG’s fiscal sustainability during FY1965–1998 (FY: fiscal year). Doi et al. (2011) also rejected GG’s fiscal sustainability for 1980Q1–2010Q1, allowing for the possibility of regime changes. On the contrary, Fujii (2010) supported CG’s fiscal sustainability over 1992Q2–2007Q1, and Mochida (2015) defended WLG’s fiscal sustainability during 1980Q1–2011Q4. Yoshida (2019) scrutinized the fiscal sustainability of GG, CG, WLG, and WSSF by a state-space model with the Kalman filter (SSMWKF) over FY1970–2017 and suggested that both GG and CG have failed to sustainably manage their finances since the late 1990 s====Unfortunately, previous research works suffer from the following shortcomings: (1) Based on the changes in the primary surplus/GDP ratio and the government debt/GDP ratio in each government sector, each government sector seems to change its fiscal posture as the surrounding conditions shift and move (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Doi et al. (2011) estimated in two regimes FRFs with a Markov-switching model (MSM). Fujii (2010) separated the analysis period into initial and subsequent parts with a recursive Chow test. However, due to the small sample-size problem with annual data, existing research (except Doi et al., Fujii, and Yoshida, 2019) did not elucidate the chronological changes of the governments’ fiscal policies. (2) Although comprehensive research (including all the government sectors) helps analyzers minutely assess whether Japan’s public finance has been sustainably functioning, only Yoshida (2019) has simultaneously scrutinized every public subsector. (3) The research results are dependent on the dataset. (4) Even the studies listed above in Item (1) did not scrutinize the factor that caused the structural changes regarding government-finance posture. (5) Except Nguyen et al. (2016), which compared the performance between an ordinary least-squares (OLS) model and an SSMWKF, most studies did not shed light on performance comparisons among estimation models (methods). (6) Only Yoshida (2019) developed time-varying parameter models with effective control variables==== using an SSMWKF, as in Burger et al. (2012), Nguyen et al. (2016), and Paniagua et al. (2017). (7) Despite using time-series data, most research (except Yoshida, 2020) did not thoroughly investigate whether the estimated FRFs are ordinary regressions or cointegration relationships. (8) Most research (except Yoshida, 2020) did not consider the effects of fiscal transfers among public subsectors (see Sections 2 and 4.1.). Moreover, (9) although Mahdavi (2014) and Ghosh et al. (2013) considered the relationship between government-finance posture and political and socio-economic conditions, most research did not.====Therefore, I tackled the above shortcomings in the following steps. First, I estimated the quarterly figures of the variables used in this study for 1976Q2–2020Q1 with data from such resources as National Accounts (NAs) (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan) and White Paper on Local Public Finance (WPLPF) (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Government of Japan) and prepared a dataset whose sample size is sufficient to appropriately scrutinize fiscal-policy changes.==== Second, I confirmed the properties of the regression models through unit root tests on each variable and cointegration tests on each combination of variables, allowing for structural change(s), as in the following previous works: Perron (1989), Zivot and Andrews (1992), Lee and Strazicich (2003), and Gregory and Hansen (1996). Third, I elucidated the chronological changes of the governments’ fiscal policies with four different estimation models: (1) a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) error (AR1E) model, i.e., a regression model with first-order autoregressive errors, or an OLS model, (2) an MSM, (3) a least-squares with breakpoints (LSWB) model, and (4) an SSMWKF. I eventually compared the estimation performance among the models and obtained robust results. I considered the effects of fiscal transfers among public subsectors and political and socio-economic conditions and investigated the factor that convinced each government to change its fiscal policy using a discrete threshold regression model (TRM) developed by Hansen (1999) with a threshold variable, which explains the state of the economy and the government sectors’ finances.====The following are the main findings of this study: (1) The estimation of the LSWB model outperformed the others. (2) CG engaged in sustainable fiscal policy from the late 1970 s through the 2000 s. These findings are consistent with GDP changes and the implementation of fiscal consolidation measures by CG. WLG sustainably managed its finances around the 1990 s. WSSF has basically failed to manage its finances sustainably since the beginning of the 2010 s. GG has been in an unfavorable state for fiscal sustainability since the mid-1990 s (3) The results of the LSWB models and the discrete TRMs demonstrate that CG and WSSF were compelled by Japan’s economic state to adjust their fiscal postures, and fiscal severity caused WLG to change its posture for the analysis term.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related literature and describes the fiscal relationships in GG. Section 3 reviews the theoretical backbone of Bohn’s method, and Section 4 explains my empirical models and data.

Previous studies that examined this relationship present mixed results - namely that cross-border diversification improves bank performance but also increases bank risks that could lead to systemic failure. Even so, this line of debate has not been examined in the case of Japanese banks conducting international operations. The present study questions whether cross-border diversification improves the performance of Japanese banks and to what extent each cross-border expansion activity affects bank performance. The latter was largely ignored in previous studies. Our results show that cross-border diversification improves cost efficiency but decreases/harms the profit efficiency of the banks analyzed. In addition, we find that the expansion of foreign assets and foreign branch operations present funding risks and operational inefficiency. We offer two important recommendations. First, as a major player in international lending, the current expansion activities of Japanese banks require close monitoring and supervision to prevent systemic risk resulting from aggressive and risky overseas expansion activities. Second, the current expansion strategies of Japanese banks, especially the expansion of overseas assets and branch operations (retail banking), should be re-examined.","Cross-border banking has grown significantly within the last four decades following the removal of investment restrictions on capital flows, deregulation, financial integration, technological progress, and financial innovations (de Jonghe et al., 2015, Gulamhussen et al., 2017, Mulder and Westerhuis, 2015). Consequently, the question of why and how banks internationalize has received considerable attention in the literature (Batten and Szilagyi, 2011, Gulamhussen et al., 2016, He et al., 2019, Hsieh et al., 2010, Kabongo and Okpara, 2019, Mariotti and Piscitello, 2010, Mariscal et al., 2012, Mulder and Westerhuis, 2015, Qian and Delios, 2008, Yamori, 1998, Zapotichna, 2017). According to the resource exploitation theory (also called Dunning’s eclectic theory), multinational banks (MNBs) with superior technology and financial power expand to international markets to exploit location-specific, ownership-specific, and internalization-specific factors that enable them to maintain a competitive advantage over the financial institutions of host countries (He et al., 2019, Mariotti and Piscitello, 2010, Mariscal et al., 2012). However, leader-followership or defensive expansion theory suggests that MNBs follow their existing clients to overseas markets to service them and achieve economies of scale in their application of intangible assets (Mulder and Westerhuis, 2015, Qian and Delios, 2008, Yamori, 1997). Some strands of the literature suggest that MNBs may expand to international markets to avoid strict domestic regulations, thereby engaging in regulatory arbitrage (Houston et al., 2012, Ongena et al., 2013, Yamori, 1997), or to augment shrinking domestic financial markets (Lam, 2015, Mulder and Westerhuis, 2015). Existing empirical literature reveals four major channels for internationalization of MNBs: international investments (FDI), mergers and acquisitions, partial acquisition via shareholding, and direct establishment of international branch operations (Lopes et al., 2017).====The effects of cross-border diversification on the performance of MNBs are of practical significance in the cross-border banking literature. Many empirical studies have examined this question with diverse findings and conclusions. According to the diversification (expansion) hypothesis, cross-border diversification leads to improved earnings, shareholder value creation, reduced systemic risk exposure, and economies of scale and scope. Substantial empirical studies have confirmed these benefits. Demsetz and Strahan (1997) showed that cross-border diversification provides large bank holding companies (BHCs) with a size advantage, greater leverage, and reduced risks. In another study (Deng and Elyasiani, 2008), it was found that cross-border diversification leads to value enhancement and risk reduction in BHCs and that the geographic proximity of branches relative to BHCs plays a significant role in value-enhancing and risk-reducing potentials. Additionally, depending on the country’s local institutional setting, non-interest income was found to reduce the systemic risk exposure of diversified MNBs (de Jonghe et al., 2015). Moreover, a recent study of 384 banks in 56 countries shows that the cross-border activities of MNBs create shareholder value (Gulamhussen et al., 2017).====However, consistent with the market risk hypothesis, which suggests that diversification increases bank risk due to market-specific factors in host countries, some researchers have found that cross-border banking does not always provide the desired benefits. Battiston et al. (2012) studied the dynamics of default cascades in a network of credit interlinkages (hypothetical diversified credit institutions) and found that individual risk diversification across counterparties does not reduce systemic risks. A related study of twenty-two major banks in Asia and the Pacific after the global financial crisis showed that the spillover effect of the crisis was mainly driven by heightened risk aversion and liquidity squeezed in the global financial markets originating from the US subprime crisis (Huang et al., 2012). The risk reduction from portfolio diversification by MNBs can be offset by incentives going in the opposite direction, leading to excessive risks (Gulamhussen et al., 2014). Using zscore, expected default frequency, and other measures of risk to analyze 384 banks across more than 50 countries, the authors find that international diversification increases bank risk. Finally, Berger et al. (2017). found that international banks in the US have a much higher risk than purely domestic banks because of lower lending standards for corporate borrowers. Moreover, the authors showed that a greater marginal degree of internationalization within the subset of internationalized banks is associated with higher risk, concluding that internationalization increases bank risk, especially during market crises.====Some studies have analyzed the internationalization process and strategy of Japanese banks. Yamori, 1997, Yamori, 1998 found that foreign direct investment (FDI) of manufacturing industries determined the location choice of Japanese financial institutions in the near east, whereas Japanese banks led manufacturing in the process of internationalization in Asia and Oceania. Qian and Delios (2008) examined the expansion activities of Japanese banks between 1980 and 1998 and found that Japanese banks undertake FDI to secure internalization benefits by following their existing clients and to achieve economies of scale in their intangible assets. Batten and Szilagyi, (2011) found that Japanese banks reduced their international presence mainly to mitigate the effect of failed loans in the Asia-Pacific region between 1995 and 2008. Lastly, Lam (2015) found that Japanese banks scaled up foreign exposure between 2000 and 2012 due to their resilient balance sheet and that global and regional factors played prominent roles in the growth of cross-border claims.====The above can be summarized into two stylized facts: (1) considerable empirical studies have examined the trend, determinants, and effects of cross-border diversification on the performance of banks globally, and (2) some empirical studies have also examined the cross-border diversification activities of Japanese banks. However, the effects of cross-border diversification on the performance of Japanese banks have not been precisely investigated. The recent rise in overseas expansion activities of Japanese banks, especially in the Asia-Pacific region in the post-GFC period, and the possible overseas market risk exposure of these banks (Lam, 2015) make it imperative to systematically examine the relationship between overseas expansion activities and performance of Japanese banks under various diversification-specific activities.====Using various measures of internationalization, we examine the effects of cross-border diversification activities on the performance of some Japanese banks conducting international operations. Our results show that generally cross-border diversification improves cost efficiency, lending efficiency, and bank-level stability but decreases the profit efficiency of the banks examined. diversification-specific activities such as the expansion of ==== and ====es decrease bank-level stability and lending efficiency which implies possible funding risks and operational inefficiency. All diversification-specific activities examined decreased profit efficiency of the banks examined. These results agree with those of previous studies that there exist both benefits and risks in cross-border diversification. This study contributes to the literature in three ways: First, it covers the period from 2003 to 2020, providing the most recent empirical analysis of major Japanese banks’ international operations and performance. Therefore, the results are useful to decision-makers and evaluators in policy formulation. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this research is the first study, especially in post-GFC, to empirically examine the direct impact of overseas expansion activities on the performance of Japanese banks under various performance measures. Finally, this study empirically confirms a contention by an earlier study that the rapid overseas expansion activities of Japanese banks could lead to funding risks (Lam, 2015). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section two presents a brief note on the internationalization of Japanese banks. Section three presents the theoretical considerations and the hypotheses. Section four presents the empirical strategy, data, and summary statistics. Section five presents the estimated results. Finally, a summary of the findings and concluding remarks are presented in Section six.",Impact of international expansion strategy on the performance of Japanese banks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142522000585,23 December 2022,2022,Research Article,10.0

Since the tradeables price is determined in the world market, countries in which productivity grows faster in the tradeables sector should experience an appreciation of their real exchange rate (RER). The effect of tradeables productivity on the RER is called the Balassa-Samuelson (B-S) effect and has attracted much research. It has also interested policymakers since the B-S effect can indicate how purchasing power parity and the relative competitiveness across countries change over time.====While the key B-S prediction linking technological progress in export-oriented industries and an increasing RER seems to be borne out in some countries (for example, Japan according to Ito et al., 1999 and for developing countries according to Choudhri and Khan, 2005), it lacks more widespread applicability. The basic B-S model predicts that a rise in productivity in the tradeables sector should raise the relative price of nontradeables proportionally. However, it is argued in many papers that the B-S model lacks empirical support. This has generated a wide range of explanations.==== Using panel data for 14 OECD countries, Cardi and Restout (2015) show that the relative price of nontradeables rises by 0.78 per cent with a one per cent rise in relative productivity in the tradeables sector; i.e., not the one per cent rise in the relative price predicted by the basic B-S model. They argue that removing the assumption of frictionless intersectoral labour mobility in the basic model leads to a significant improvement in predictive ability. Specifically, the relative price and wage responses to changes in the productivity differential between tradeables and nontradeables are muted. Also, notable is the existence of persistent sectoral wage differentials. In Cardi and Restout (2015), the differentials are driven by imperfect substitutability of labour across sectors.====This study simulates a B-S model that incorporates sectoral job separation rates using Japanese data. Sectoral differences in job separation rates are readily apparent in the data. This feature of sectoral heterogeneity has rarely been discussed in the literature.==== Fig. 1 shows markedly different industry separation rates for Japan in 2018. Moreover, the separation rate in the nontradeables sector (16.2%) is higher than that in the tradeables sector (9.9%), even if the public sector were to be included.==== The relatively high separation rate in the nontradeables sector is closely related to a higher proportion of part-time workers. According to the 2018 Survey of Employment Trends conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), the share of part-time workers is 13.6% in the tradeables sector while in the nontradeables sector it is 30.4%. The separation rates for regular and part-time workers are 11.2% and 23.7%, respectively. These differences are a major reason for the separation rates in the tradeables and nontradeables sectors. However, even if we were to only focus on regular workers, the separation rate is still higher in the nontradeables sector (12.3%) compared to the tradeables sector (8.8%).====By incorporating sectoral job separation rates, we can replicate an important feature of the Japanese labour market, i.e., the nontradeables sector has higher wages than the tradeables sector. According to the 2018 MHLW data, the weighted average of the monthly salary is 329 thousand yen in the tradeables sector and 340 thousand yen in the nontradeables sector while the weighted average of the separation rate is 9.9% in the former sector and 16.4% in the latter sector. Here, we used the number of employees to calculate the weighted averages and this difference does not change if we focus only on regular workers. If we focus on the largest sector in each sector, the average monthly wage in Manufacturing (tradeables) is 320 thousand yen while in Wholesale and Retail Trade (nontradeables), it is 346 thousand yen. The separation rate in Manufacturing is 9.4 per cent, while it is 12.9 per cent in Wholesale and Retail Trade. Consistent with these facts, we argue that the separation rate and salaries are positively correlated due to the presence of a compensating wage differential.====We also discuss how sectoral job separation rates impact the B-S effect. Specifically, we show that the standard B-S effect is muted or amplified by labour movement across tradeables and nontradeables sectors. Unlike existing studies, a larger wage gap generated by sectoral separation rates has an additional impact on labour movement as well as the RER. Using Japanese data, we demonstrate that even with labour mobility a positive impact of productivity growth in the tradeables sector can lead to a dampening of the standard B-S effect. One of our conclusions is that introducing sectoral separation rates may improve the empirical predictability of the B-S model.====The next section briefly reviews the literature. Section 3 introduces the model and Section 4 derives the main theoretical propositions. A feature of the model is that wages are higher in the sector with higher separations. We then examine the B-S effect and show that the RER increases (decreases) when there is productivity growth in the tradeables (nontradeables) sector. We decompose the impact on the RER, i.e., the B-S effect, into two effects - a pure productivity effect and a labour reallocation effect. Section 5 calibrates the functional forms and parameters and discusses how the equilibrium values are determined. In Section 6, we simulate how productivity improvements affect unemployment and the RER.

Using a uniquely compiled dataset of 2559 Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our research shows that increasing labor employment during a financial crisis can significantly improve a firm’s long-term total factor productivity and sales. In other words, employment downsizing may not be the best solution when encountering an economic downturn.","A systemic crisis, involving environmental, industry and firm-specific uncertainties simultaneously, gives rise to a continuous deterioration in a firm’s performance over a certain period as reflected by financial indicators such as the return on investment (ROI) and return on assets (ROA) (Santana et al., 2017). Therefore, for a firm’s competitive advantage (short-term as well as long-term), strategically responding to changes in the external environment are crucial tasks (Porter, 1991; Wernefelt, 1984). When a firm’s decline is not properly dealt with, it may result in a firm’s eventual disappearance. Therefore, companies should act cautiously and make targeted strategic decisions during the critical phase (Barbero et al., 2017).====When facing unfavorable external shocks, operational retrenchment/downsizing strategies are prevalently adopted by firms in practice to survive the adverse conditions (Datta et al., 2010). The concept of “downsizing” includes any kinds of or combinations of asset reductions, namely, human assets, physical assets (infrastructure, plant and equipment), financial assets or informational assets (Dewitt, 1998, Cascio, 2014).==== Given the ongoing prevalence of downsizing, however, we cast doubts on its effectiveness for improved performance according to conflicting extant findings. One the one hand, downsizing reduces compensation costs, which increases firm profitability (Cascio, 1993); on the other hand, from the perspective of knowledge-based view of the firm (Grant, 2003), a firm may lose the knowledge embedded in laid-off employees and lead to an erosion of a firm’s valuable resources and capabilities, and thus downsizing may negatively impact a firm’s long-term performance (Luan et al., 2013). In this regard, a research question is raised: Does downsizing improve firm performance?====The financial tsunami of 2008–2009 initiated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers is a proper context for answering aforementioned inquiry. During that period, a global financial crisis rapidly spread across the world and affected both developed and developing countries. The economic recession led firms to face sluggish demand and further impacted firms’ survival. How to survive the global crisis became the main task for firms. This study adopts the lens of organizational turnaround strategies during a crisis (Santana et al., 2017, Wenzel et al., 2020, Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2021) to explore how firms respond to the crisis and what the performance implications are for different responding strategies.====We do so by using a uniquely compiled firm-level dataset of 2559 Taiwanese manufacturing firms who experienced the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. Firms’ responses to the crisis (e.g., R&D and employment decisions) and post-crisis performance were therefore observed. We found that when encountering the extreme environment shock, most firms took employment downsizing, as the extant literature predicts (Datta et al., 2010). Furthermore, echoing the resource-based view of the firm (Russo and Fouts, 1997, Foss, 1998, Tsang, 1998, Wernerfelt, 1984), we showed that firm size positively moderates the relationships between the financial crisis and employment or R&D decisions. As for the performance implication of downsizing, we observed that increasing labor employment during the financial crisis can significantly improve a firm’s long-term total factor productivity and sales. This finding suggests that employment downsizing is not the only possible or recommended course of action when facing a decline.====Our study contributes to the literature on the organizational turnaround strategy by demonstrating importance of human resource policy and the organizations’ capabilities to managing the systemic crisis. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide an overview of extant research on organizational crisis responses, focusing on firms’ employment and R&D decisions. We then explain the empirical models in Section 3. We describe the data sources and relevant variables in Section 4. Section 5 presents the descriptive statistics, main findings in this study. We conclude the paper with a summary of key takeaway messages, managerial and policy implications.",Is downsizing a good strategy during the downturn?

This paper examines how ","This paper demonstrates that expenditure/income discrepancies (alternatively referred to as statistical discrepancies) appearing in national accounts are caused partly by the nominal distortion due to the presence of two price units, and partly by the real distortion due to the mismeasurement of expenditure items. In addition, it investigates how such statistical discrepancies reveal potentially important information about various informal, although not necessarily illegal, economic activities, which are not grasped fully by statistical or tax authorities in a central government.====Three cases are presented in this paper. First, if after-consumption-tax prices are mixed with before-consumption-tax prices in aggregating expenditures, and there exist economic activities that are audited by tax authorities but are unnoticed by statistical agencies, then the aggregate expenditure in the national accounts is dominated by the aggregate income based on taxation data. Second, if black-market prices coexist with official prices as in the Japanese economy during and immediately after World War II, and the value added that is produced in the formal economic sectors flows into the underground economy through illegal transactions, then the taxation-data-based income is dominated by the national-account-based expenditure. The third case is a situation where prices are quoted in not only a conventional currency unit, but also a more valuable cryptocurrency unit, but where the latter currency is still evaluated one to one with the former. Then, there emerges a case basically identical to the second case when the cryptocurrency (conventional currency) unit plays the same role as official (black-market) prices in terms of a stronger (weaker) currency unit.====Unlike in macroeconomic disequilibrium models, the discrepancies between the national-account-based expenditure and the taxation-data-based income are not ==== concepts, but they actually occur ====. As demonstrated in detail in this paper, when the expenditure is dominated by the income, ==== excess supply in goods markets is equivalent to ==== excess demand in money markets within the formal economy. Conversely, when the income is dominated by the expenditure, ==== excess goods demand corresponds to ==== excess money supply within the formal economy.====In the first case, money demand exceeding supply in the formal economy is canceled out by partially unrecorded cash payments to a government, representing a decrease in money demand outside the formal economy (or money redeemed by a central bank). More concretely, consumption tax payments are partially omitted as a result of using after-consumption-tax prices in aggregating some expenditures. In the second case, however, money supply exceeding demand in the formal economy is absorbed by additional money demand from those in the informal economy. In the wartime Japanese economy, enormous quantities of money issued as war finance were indeed absorbed by strong demand for anonymous Bank of Japan (BOJ) notes from black-market dealers for concealing illegal income.====In addition to those driven by the nominal distortion from the presence of two price units, expenditure/income discrepancies may be caused by the real distortion from the mismeasurement of expenditure items. Concretely, the real distortion includes an omission of expenditure items by statistical agencies such as their failure to notice newly emerging economic activities in the first case, and a decrease in real expenditure uncounted by statistical or tax authorities, such as their failure to audit illegal inventory disposals (==== in Japanese) or unlawful goods transfers to foreign countries in the second case.====The third case is presented as a future possibility in the age of cryptocurrencies. Here, we consider the introduction of a new cryptocurrency to be the addition of another currency unit. If market exchange rates between two currencies are ignored intentionally and arbitrarily by taxpayers for tax saving, then serious discrepancies again arise between the national-account-based expenditure and the taxation-data-based income. This case is not just theoretical, but rather occurred prior to the establishment of single currency units within each sovereign state in the 19th century.====Because the Cabinet Office, which serves as one of the Japanese statistical agencies, does not currently provide separate estimates of expenditure and income in the national accounts, the expenditure/income discrepancy has not been mentioned very frequently among academic researchers or policymakers in Japan. In the countries where the expenditure and the income are measured independently,==== on the other hand, the extent to which the income is dominated by the expenditure has been considered as something associated with the measurement of the informal economy, in particular a proxy for the size of the underground economy.==== However, Thomas (1999), Tanzi (1999), and others argue that such statistical discrepancies do not necessarily have theoretical justifications as a measure of the informal economy.====In this paper, we pay careful attention to two occasions in which expenditure/income discrepancies did matter even in Japan’s national accounts. First, the Economic Planning Agency EPA (1964) estimated expenditure and income separately for the Japanese national accounts in the period from the 1930s to the 1960s, and presented largely positive statistical discrepancies (income far less than expenditure) for the economy of the late 1930s and 1940s, where black markets were ubiquitous. Mizoguchi and Nojima (1993) and Mizoguchi (1996), though informally, stated that the presence of black markets was responsible for such positive statistical discrepancies. Second, Fujiwara and Ogawa (2016) computed aggregate income from taxation data for the current Japanese economy, and found the opposite case where the expenditure is dominated by the income. Following the methodology developed by Saito (2021), this paper provides a unifying analytical framework to interpret these positive and negative expenditure/income discrepancies in a consistent manner.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the macroeconomic implications of expenditure/income discrepancies in national accounts, and in particular for possible monetary and nonmonetary (real) interactions with the informal or underground economy. Section 3 presents one current example and one historical example in which expenditure/income discrepancies emerged in Japan’s national accounts. Section 4 presents one future possibility in which statistical discrepancies may be caused by the presence of a conventional currency unit and a private cryptocurrency unit.

But unlike other forms of collateralised borrowing, the payment obligations associated with such derivatives are not reported on the balance sheet: they are in a very real sense “missing debt”. This introduces gaps in the compilation of countries’ and sectors’ foreign currency positions, in particular their short-term US dollar obligations and receipts. When economic shocks occur, policies designed to restore the flow of dollar liquidity outside the United States (eg central bank swap lines) are blind to the scale of dollar liquidity needs in particular locations. This paper presents evidence that the missing dollar debt of banks and non-banks outside the United States is large, roughly double the dollar debt recorded on their balance sheets. It then reviews how well benchmark statistical collections – BIS international ==== statistics (IBS), BIS OTC Derivatives (OTCD) statistics, International Investment Position (IIP) statistics, and the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS)) – capture foreign currency positions, both on- and off-balance sheet, and where modifications to these statistics could help to close data gaps.","Two recent episodes of global financial distress – the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2007–09 and the market turmoil in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic went global – illustrated the central role of the US dollar in the financial system. In both episodes, a credit risk shock somewhere in the global economy led to a scarcity of dollar funding both inside and outside the United States. The cost of securing short-term dollars jumped as the suppliers pulled back. Banks and non-banks alike, many of them otherwise solvent, suddenly faced dollar repayment obligations when their dollar funding positions could no longer be rolled over. These disruptions in dollar funding markets prompted an extraordinary policy response in the form of central bank swap lines, whereby the Federal Reserve channelled US dollars to several central banks, to be on-lent to private borrowers in need of dollar funding.====These episodes of market stress highlight the need for statistics that track the geography of outstanding short-term US dollar payment obligations. In the event of a future global shock, such statistics should be able to shed light on where – ie in which countries and markets – might dollar liquidity needs arise, and on the scale of the short-term rollover needs. Currently, analysts often rely on indicators derived from benchmark international statistical collections. These include the ==== (IIP) statistics, the ==== (CPIS), the BIS Locational Banking Statistics (LBS) and the ==== (OTCD) statistics, each of which has a currency breakdown to separate foreign from domestic currencies. Used in combination, they yield inputs for risk indicators of countries’ and sectors’ ==== positions, such as the level and maturity structure of foreign currency gross and net debt, foreign currency roll-over needs, and future drains to liquid foreign currency assets and reserves.====However, these statistics provide, at best, an incomplete picture of countries’ foreign currency positions, in particular of their short-term positions in US dollars. Several types of foreign exchange (FX) derivatives – in particular FX swaps, outright FX forwards and currency swaps – have debt-like characteristics that can exacerbate stresses in financial markets: they involve the actual payment of foreign currency (usually the US dollar) equal to the notional value of the derivative; they typically have very short-term maturities; and the outstanding dollar payment obligations associated with these instruments are significant by almost any measure. However, positions in these instruments are not adequately captured in the benchmark statistics used to track countries' foreign currency positions.====This largely stems from their accounting treatment. FX swaps and currency swaps – both temporary exchanges of one currency for another – are, in effect, collateralised loans, akin to a repurchase agreement (repo) – a temporary exchange of cash and a security – or to a short-term collateralised foreign currency loan from a bank. Outright FX forwards similarly require the delivery of currency at maturity. However, repo and bank loans are considered debt and are reported on the bank and corporate balance sheets that feed into the compilation of benchmark statistics. By contrast, under standard accounting treatments, the payment obligations associated with FX derivatives do ==== appear on the balance sheet. These obligations are, in effect, “missing debt” that is not picked up in most benchmark statistics.====Globally, the amount of missing debt from FX derivatives is significant. At end-2021, the combined outstanding amount of FX swaps, outright forwards and currency swaps – hereafter referred to as “FX swaps/forwards” for convenience – reached $94 trillion.==== For perspective, this figure was roughly equivalent to global GDP in 2021 ($96 trillion), exceeded global cross-border portfolio investment ($81 trillion) and international bank claims ($40 trillion) at end-2021, and was more than triple the value of global trade ($28.5 trillion) in 2021. Moreover, the US dollar is on one side of most outstanding positions. For entities residing outside the United States, the dollars owed via FX swaps/forwards are foreign currency payment obligations, and thus contribute to the foreign currency liquidity risk in the country in which they reside.====This paper argues that the missing debt associated with FX swaps/forwards constitutes a key data gap that warrants further attention from policy makers and statisticians. Benchmark statistics that capture only countries’ on-balance sheet foreign currency assets and liabilities – ie cash, loans, bonds, equities, repo, etc – yield incomplete measures of foreign currency receipts and payment obligations and thus misleading measures of gross and net foreign currency positions and short-term rollover needs. This, in turn, makes it difficult for policy makers to anticipate where dollar liquidity shortages may arise and to assess the scale of the rollover needs, thus complicating the implementation of policies designed to restore the smooth flow of short-term dollars in the financial system (eg central bank swap lines).====The first section draws mainly on the OTCD statistics, the most comprehensive source of information on global FX derivatives markets, to establish the scale of this data gap. It sets the stage with what we know that we know – the “known knowns” – regarding the size and structure of the markets for FX swaps/forwards, the most traded instruments and currency pairs, the maturity profile of outstanding positions, and the types of entities that use these instruments.====The following sections then turn to what we do not currently know but ==== know, ie the “known unknowns”. Specifically, how is the foreign currency debt associated with FX swaps/forwards distributed across sectors and countries? It builds on Borio et al., 2017, Borio et al., 2020 by combining the OTCD statistics with the CPIS and other statistics to establish relationships between outstanding FX swaps/forwards and indicators of the types of economic activity in which they are used. While some market participants use FX swaps/forwards to engage in speculation, the bulk of outstanding positions have been taken to hedge foreign currency assets/liabilities portfolios and accounts payables/receivables from trade in goods and services.====This data combination provides a rough allocation of the missing debt across sectors globally (ie banks and non-banks), and it helps to highlight geographical concentrations of FX derivatives use. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the missing dollar debt of non-banks outside the United States, for whom the dollar is a foreign currency, could be as high as $25 trillion, roughly double their estimated on-balance sheet dollar debt ($13 trillion). That said, the key takeaway is that ==== about how FX derivatives contribute to the foreign currency liquidity profile of specific countries.====The penultimate discusses options for improving coverage of the missing debt from FX swaps/forwards in benchmark statistical collections. Closing the data gap presents a trade-off between data granularity and the cost of collection. Complete coverage of the missing debt from FX derivatives would entail the reporting of outstanding gross notional amounts in one or more of the benchmark statistics, with crossed breakdowns by currency, country, sector, maturity, and instrument. However, collecting such detailed data is costly for both reporting institutions and the statistical agencies that compile national aggregates. Targeted improvements that prioritise the currency, country and sector dimensions in benchmark statistics, taken in combination, could reduce this reporting burden and still yield the metrics needed to measure how the missing debt is distributed across countries and sectors.",FX swaps and forwards in global dollar debt: “Known knowns” and “known unknowns”,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142522000457,28 October 2022,2022,Research Article,16.0

In Japan, some demand-inducing policies targeting such industries were implemented, known as the Go To Travel and Go To Eat campaigns. Using a unique individual-level survey, we investigate what factors make people respond to these campaign policies. We find that certain socioeconomics factors (e.g., gender, income, ICT skills) as well as noneconomic factors matter. In particular, risk attitudes, and personal traits (e.g., extraversion) crucially affect whether people traveled or dined out in response to these campaigns despite the spread of COVID-19.","Since February 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread with alarming speed all over the world. Governments have imposed lockdowns to restrict mobility and activities and contain the spread of the virus. However, the containment measures have plunged economies worldwide into significant contraction. The negative impact on gross domestic product growth is massive. Many countries have implemented economic support measures, such as cash handouts, subsidies, allowances, financial support, provisional reductions of value added taxes (VAT), and postponement of ==== payments. One of the central issues has been whether to prioritize measures to limit the spread of infections or to focus on mitigating the large economic downturn. Countermeasures to COVID-19 in many countries have wavered between these two priorities.====). These industries have been required to shut down their businesses or shorten their working hours during periods of increased restrictions and lockdowns to combat the COVID-19 spread. They have also, therefore, been a key target for special government support, including subsidies, allowances, and postponement of rent payments.====The tourism and hospitality sectors are always fragile in catastrophic events such as natural disasters and pandemics (====). The pandemic of COVID-19 is much more severe than we have experienced. In case of Japan, according to Indices of Tertiary Industry Activity, prepared by METI ====, ==== the index of the tourism sector decreased by half from January to June 2020, and subsequently the government demand-inducing policies (“Go To Campaign” policies, as discussed below) helped recovery in some degree from July to December 2020, but the tourism sector remained stagnant in 2021. According to ====, COVID-19 involves three major unique aspects. First, the number of people affected is larger than in other epidemics. Second, the geographical spread is over the world, while most natural disasters are spatially very limited. Third, the duration is longer. Several waves of infections magnify uncertainty and it stops business. These aspects require governments to take large scale countermeasures against COVID-19 in tourism and hospitality sectors, in particular.====We use a unique individual survey to investigate what individual socioeconomic factors, personal behaviors (e.g., individual COVID countermeasures), and noneconomic factors (e.g., personality traits) lead people to respond to or refrain from using the demand-inducing measures in tourism and hospitality sectors. We investigate two Japanese voucher policies, the “Go To Travel” and “Go To Eat” campaigns, in detail from the aspect of individual behaviors.====A reason for investigating the Japanese campaign policies is in the unique infection control measures. The Japanese infection control measures do not rely on legal sanctions or penalties and are instead request-based. Some people could travel and/or dine out with some fear of infection but without legal penalties. The behaviors largely depend on their own responsibility, which is largely influenced by personal characteristics, socioeconomic factors and non-economic factors.

The main results obtained are as follows. First, while the HHIs for loans and deposits show an upward trend, the HHI for loans in large metropolitan areas, which was already low, continued to further decline, indicating that competition among financial institutions in large metropolitan regions, which already was severe, has continued to intensify. Second, increases in the HHI are not only due to reductions in the number of financial institutions but also to the growing variation in financial institutions’ market share. And third, while an increase in the loan HHI due to a merger of financial institutions is sustained for a certain period, the duration of such an increase tends to be shorter in regions with a low market concentration.","Japan’s deposit-taking financial institutions have faced a variety of changes in their business environment from the 1990s to the present, including the bursting of the asset price bubble, the disposal of bad loans and the domestic financial crisis, sluggish loan demand due to long-term economic stagnation, a shrinking population, and the growth of fintech. Many financial institutions have merged or integrated operations in response to these changes. Regional banks, which have not integrated their operations much to date, have recently begun to do so and have also taken steps to form alliances with other financial institutions. In addition to business mergers and alliances, financial institutions are not only tapping demand for loans in their traditional home region but are also trying to lend in regions outside their traditional “home base” — i.e., they engage in so-called cross-regional lending.====What is the extent of competition among deposit-taking financial institutions in Japan as a result of these activities, including business mergers, alliances, and cross-regional lending? Studies have used different methods to answer this question. Some examine the degree of competition in the market by focusing on financial institutions’ price-cost margin, i.e., the difference between the interest rate they set and their marginal cost (Ogura, 2012, Ojima, 2018).==== Other studies focus on whether the loan market is monopolistic, perfectly competitive, or somewhere in between, using the conduct parameter approach, which simultaneously considers supply and demand structures (Uchida and Tsutsui, 2005, Maruyama, 2020, Ogura, 2020).====Yet other studies calculate the degree of market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and regard this as measure of the degree of competition (Nakata and Adachi, 2006, Ogura, 2012, Harimaya and Ozaki, 2017). The HHI is interpreted intuitively as follows. If the market is dominated by a single financial institution, the HHI will be 1, meaning there is no competition in the market; on the other hand, if the number of financial institutions in the market is large and market shares are evenly distributed among them, the HHI will be small, meaning competition in the market is fierce. More rigorously, if each financial institution assumes that an increase in loans/deposits by one institution has the same impact on the supply of loans/deposits in the entire market, the HHI is proportionately related to the average price-cost margin for all financial institutions in the market, which represents the market power, and shows the degree of competition in the market.====In this study, we employ this last approach using the HHI to examine the extent of competition in Japan’s loan and deposit markets. Specifically, we use the HHI to gauge market concentration by identifying the scope of a market and then adding the square of the market shares of the financial institutions present in that market.====The HHI is widely used by policymakers because it shows the degree of competition in the market and because it is relatively easy to measure. For example, in the “Guidelines to Application of the Antimonopoly Act Concerning Review of Business Combinations,” the Fair Trade Commission sets the extent of change in the HHI as one of the criteria for determining whether a business combination should be subject to review. In actual reviews of bank mergers, the Fair Trade Commission publishes the HHI of the target market. For instance, in the case of Fukuoka Financial Group’s integration of Eighteenth Bank, approved in August 2018, the review shows the HHI in the loan market before the merger and the expected increase in the HHI after the merger.====However, administrative authorities have not yet presented comprehensive HHIs for loan and deposit markets for every region in Japan.==== Although researchers have measured the HHI for loan markets based on available data, they have not been able to measure the HHI comprehensively and accurately due to a lack of necessary information. For example, Nakata and Adachi (2006), Ogura (2012), and Harimaya and Ozaki (2017) have calculated the HHI based on certain assumptions about financial institutions’ loans and total assets by region, as not all data on loan and deposit values by region and by financial institution are available, which may have resulted in deviations from the true HHI. Deviations may result from the exclusion of large banks from the calculation (Nakata and Adachi, 2006, Harimaya and Ozaki, 2017) and due to the assumption that loans and deposits are uniformly distributed across the branches of individual financial institutions (Ogura, 2012, Harimaya and Ozaki, 2017). In addition, due to limitations in the available data, prior studies have mainly conducted analyses at the prefectural level and have not examined whether prefectures constitute the appropriate geographic scope for loan and deposit markets.====Against this backdrop, this study aims to present a comprehensive analysis of concentration in Japan’s regional loan and deposit markets using the HHI. We construct the HHI for local loan and deposit markets for the period 2005–2019. Our HHI is more comprehensive and accurate than those provided in earlier studies as we use branch-level information on the outstanding amount of loans and deposits reported by financial institutions (banks, ==== banks, and credit cooperatives) and collected by the Financial Services Agency. The HHI is calculated not only at the prefectural level but also at the level of metropolitan employment areas (MEAs) and micropolitan employment areas (MCEA), regional classifications proposed by Kanemoto and Tokuoka (2002) to accurately reflect the extent to which different regions are economically linked with each other.====This study also aims to examine the characteristics of the loan and deposit HHIs we calculate. For this purpose, we perform a factor decomposition of the HHI. As highlighted by Hannan (1997) and Cetorelli (1999), the fewer the number of financial institutions in a market or the greater the deviation of individual financial institutions’ market share from the mean, the higher the HHI. We therefore decompose the HHI into two components: one related to the number of deposit-taking financial institutions and the other to the deviation from the mean market share, and then examine the importance of the two components in terms of explaining the level of and changes in the HHI.====Further, we examine the extent to which mergers and acquisitions among financial institutions increase the HHI and the persistence of such an increase. When two or more financial institutions merge, the square of the share of the merged institution is always larger than the sum of the squares of the share of each of the merging institutions, leading to an increase in the HHI. Thus, focusing on the mergers of financial institutions in Japan, we calculate the expected increase in the HHI relative to the ex-ante HHI level. In addition, we examine how long higher HHI levels persist in regions where mergers have taken place. These analyses reveal the medium-term effects of bank mergers on the concentration of loan and deposit markets.====The main results obtained are as follows. Both the loan HHI and the deposit HHI tend to be low in metropolitan prefectures and high in rural prefectures. Furthermore, the HHI at the MEA level tends to be lower in areas where prefectural capitals and government ordinance-designated cities are located than in areas comprising non-designated cities only. Heterogeneity in market concentration exists not only between metropolitan and rural prefectures but also within prefectures between areas that include the prefectural capital and other areas. The average loan HHI and deposit HHI increased throughout the observation period. However, the loan HHI for metropolitan areas, which already was at low levels, has tended to decline further, indicating that competition in such areas has continued to intensify.====The increase in the HHI is not only due to reductions in the number of financial institutions but also to increases in the variation in financial institutions’ market share. Examining the persistence of HHI increases due to bank mergers, we find that the increase in the loan HHI diminishes to about half of the originally anticipated increase in the five years after the merger. The persistence of increases in the loan HHI differs depending on the level of the ex-ante market concentration. In prefectures with a lower market concentration, the increase in the loan HHI following a merger becomes statistically insignificant within five years, while in regions with a higher concentration the increase remains unchanged.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes our analytical framework and explains the methods used to measure the HHI and perform the factor decomposition. Section 3 introduces the data used in the analysis.

Specifically, we empirically investigated how this order changed the nighttime light (NTL) in regions with restaurants in the Greater Tokyo area from January to June 2020. Several local governments in Japan had implemented the order to combat COVID-19. Our investigation found evidence that the order significantly decreased the NTL in regions with many restaurants, indicating the effectiveness of the order and its negative economic/business impacts on restaurants. Interestingly, this order increased the NTL in other areas, such as in residential areas. In contrast to previous studies focused on demand-side factors, our study revealed the importance of supply-side factors in explaining the impact of Japanese government policy against COVID-19 in the first half of 2020.","Since its outbreak in early 2020, various restrictions, including citywide or nationwide lockdowns, have been imposed on people and businesses to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One typical measure is the closure of schools and workplaces. Peoples’ movements have been restricted not only between countries but also between intra-national regions. Public events have been canceled. In addition, restrictions have been placed on gatherings according to the number of people. Stay-at-home orders have required people to remain at home with exceptions being made only for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and “essential” trips. Numerous countries have imposed such restrictions to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. These measures have affected economic and social activities.====Japan, among other countries, has introduced various measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including a declaration of a state of emergency and various restrictive measures. Here, we focused on the effect of the government order to shorten business hours on restaurants in the Greater Tokyo area in Japan. Our focus on the restaurant sector is important because restaurants are considered a major source of spreading COVID-19. Many countries have introduced similar measures. For example, bars in Paris were ordered to close at 10 pm from September 28, 2020 onward.==== Moreover, the governor of New York announced on November 11, 2020, that restaurants and liquor-serving establishments must remain closed between 10 pm and 5 am.==== ==== have shown that the measures by the governments to contain the pandemic are major sources of concern for entrepreneurs in the restaurant business.====Specifically, we examine how the government order changed restaurants’ business operations by measuring the brightness of nighttime light (NTL). We employed two kinds of data for the analysis: the remotely sensed data on NTL at a spatial resolution of 500 m × 500 m and the OpenStreetMap (OSM), which is a free and editable world map powered by high-resolution satellite images. Volunteers worldwide have added spatial information, such as the shapes of roads, buildings, and points of interest (POIs). Using this information, we identified the location of restaurants. Furthermore, we investigated how the NTL of restaurants at a location point in terms of its daily level changed when the order of shortening business hours was given for that location. The shortening order differs by prefecture and date. Our empirical identification relies on these differences. Because the order of shortening business hours requests restaurants to close early, the NTL is expected to decrease if the order is effective at a given location on a given date. We analyzed the NTL from January 2 to June 23, 2020, when the first measure was ordered in Japan.====This study aims to contribute to the growing body of literature on the effects of lockdown orders on business/economic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of restrictive measures, such as lockdown orders, on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (Ullah and Ajala, 2020; ====; ====), the number of deaths (====), unemployment insurance claims (====), air pollution (e.g., ====; ====; ====) have been investigated in previous studies. Furthermore, several scholars have examined the effect of lockdown orders on the NTL (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). These investigations have consistently found that lockdown orders dimmed the NTL in various countries, such as China, India, Germany, and Spain.====Although the present study also explores the effect of one form of lockdown order on the NTL, we examine such an effect at a higher spatial resolution (500 m × 500 m) linked with the location information. Due to this link at a detailed spatial unit, we can investigate the effect of government policy for specific players. Specifically, since this study focuses on the location with restaurants, the brightness of the NTL provides two types of essential information to policymakers engaged in developing policies against infectious diseases such as COVID-19. One is that the NTL brightness directly enables one to ascertain whether restaurants are open or closed. Using this information, policymakers can determine the rate of compliance by the restaurants or the effectiveness of the order. Second, it may be used to estimate the impacts of restrictive measures on the business performance of the restaurants because business performance largely depends on business hours. Furthermore, one notable benefit of an NTL study is its speed: information on the NTL can be obtained within approximately a week. More accurate information on the compliance rate and economic impacts on the restaurants can be obtained by checking the accounting records of the restaurants, but it takes the government a considerably long time to obtain those records; in the case of emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid responses from the government are crucial.====Our major findings can be summarized as follows. First, we found that the order of shortening business hours significantly decreased the NTL in areas with many restaurants. This result did not change even when controlling for other types of order, namely, a state of emergency and the closing down of businesses. In addition, a similar finding was obtained in our analysis with a machine learning technique called “causal forest.”==== Second, the business hour shortening order increased the NTL in other areas, such as residential areas. In particular, this increase can be found after the order was lifted. In sum, the order of shortening business hours worked as it reduced the NTL around the restaurant area. Our findings indicate that this government order succeeded in reducing people’s sojourn time at restaurants, which is a major source of spreading COVID-19.====Our results contribute to the debate on the relationship between the low death rate and the loose lockdown policy in Japan at least in 2020 (====).==== The literature has emphasized the role of people’s voluntary restriction on movement. Namely, government orders and the spread of information on COVID-19 cases in the public induced people to refrain from leaving their homes (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). In the context of dining outside, these studies have shown the decrease of demand by consumers through their stay-at-home behavior was a major factor behind the success of Japanese government policy. By contrast, we show that the order of shortening business hours decreased supply in restaurant services, which are considered a major source of spreading COVID-19, contributing to lowering the infection risk. Our study revealed the importance of supply-side factors that have not been considered in previous studies in explaining the impact of Japanese government policy against COVID-19 in the first half of 2020.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces the issue of the COVID-19 pandemic and policy measures against the pandemic in Japan.

Ise City employs a sealed-bid first-price auction with reserve and minimal prices in the selection of contractors. Upon completion of the project, Ise City evaluates the quality of the work using a 100-point scale score based on items such as administration, safety, time management, external appearance, and functionality. Our results show that the winning price in the auction does not affect the quality of the work. We discuss several reasons behind this finding.","The quality of public projects is often as important as the cost of procurement for governments, especially when the project involves construction work. In 2005, “the Act for Promoting Quality Assurance in Public Works” was enforced in Japan under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), which requires both central and municipal governments to maintain the quality of public construction projects. In response to the act, many municipal governments decided to conduct an ex-post performance evaluation for every construction project after completion.====Soon after the enforcement of this act, MLIT (2007) advocated that there is a positive correlation between the quality of public construction projects and the winning price in the procurement auction, based on their analysis of data from governmental construction projects in 2003. That is, a low winning price tends to lead to a low quality. Based on this belief, MLIT has instructed municipal governments to set a minimum price, which is the lowest acceptable price in procurement auctions, and has required an upward revision of the minimum price every few years.====In this article, we examine the existence of such correlation in a recent municipal procurement. We explore the contractor’s choice of quality using the ex-post quality evaluation data of public construction projects procured by Ise City in Japan. Ise City employs a sealed-bid first-price auction with reserve and minimum prices to select the contractor for public procurement. Upon completion of the project, Ise City evaluates the quality of the work using a 100-point scale score based on items such as administration, safety, time management, external appearance, and functionality.====In our results based on the three types of estimation models, the impact of the winning price on the quality of the work is not confirmed. The results suggest that the winning price and the quality are not related to each other in Ise City’s procurement.====It should be noted that the estimation results may contain a downward bias that makes the correlation between the price and the quality unclear because of the potential sample selectivity. With one exception, no projects of extremely low quality are observed in the data. Hence, it is also likely that the use of minimum prices is effective in maintaining quality.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the relevant literature.

These results indicate that exporting sophisticated products can reduce export volatility and profit volatility arising from exchange rate swings.,"The Japanese chemical industry is the country’s second largest manufacturing industry, with annual shipments exceeding USD 400 billion.==== Chemical firms provide super engineering plastics and elastomers for automobiles, fluorinated polyimide, photoresists, and etching gas for electronic parts and components, soda ash for glass, and other vital inputs for downstream industries. Table 1 indicates how upstream the Japanese chemical industry is in the world economy. The table shows Japan’s chemical exports and imports with its 16 largest chemical trading partners. Japan’s exports to the world in this sector are almost twice as large as its imports. Its exports are more than twice as large as it imports with China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, three times as large with Vietnam, and six times as large with the Philippines. Thus many firms in Asia and elsewhere depend on Japanese chemical imports.====The Japanese chemical industry is sophisticated as measured, for instance, by the product complexity index (PCI) of Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009). Hidalgo and Hausmann posited that a product is simple if it can be made ubiquitously and complex if only a few countries can make it. They employed the method of reflections to calculate PCIs for 1242 products at the Harmonized System (HS) 4-digit level. For the chemical industry, many countries produce goods such as ammonia. This product is thus classified as simple. On the other hand, Japan produces 90% of the world’s fluorinated polyimide and 70% of its etching gas (Obayashi, 2019). Since Japan is one of only a few countries that produce these goods, they are classified as complex. Using the PCI of Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009), the weighted average complexity of Japan’s chemical exports in 2019 equaled 0.83184. Examining the three leading chemical exporters, these values are 0.5834 for Germany, 0.5662 for the U.S., and 0.5579 for China. For Japanese chemical imports, the value is 0.43331. Thus Japan’s chemical export basket is more complex than the baskets of other leading exporters and than the basket of chemicals that Japan imports.====This paper investigates how exchange rates affect the Japanese chemical industry. This may be an important issue in the future. Ilzetzki et al. (2020) and Rogoff (2020) stated that exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar have remained “eerily” stable during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, during the Global Financial Crisis the Japanese yen/dollar rate fluctuated between 76 and 123. During the COVID-19 crisis, on the other hand, the yen/dollar rate remained between 103 and 115. Ilzetzki et al. and Rogoff said that, if history is a guide, exchange rate volatility will return and the dollar will depreciate towards its mean.====Arbatli and Hong, 2016, Abiad et al. 2018, and Asian Development Bank, 2018 have noted that products with higher PCIs are less substitutable in international trade and should therefore have lower exchange rate elasticities. We investigate exchange rate elasticities for Japan’s aggregate chemical exports and imports. We find that aggregate exports are not affected by exchange rates while aggregate imports have a price elasticity of 0.31. We also estimate elasticities for 93 individual chemical categories. We find that exports of products with higher PCIs are less harmed by exchange rate appreciations.====Ito, Koibuchi, Sato, and Shimizu (2016) observed that an appreciating yen can not only lower exports (if the appreciation is passed through to higher retail prices abroad) but can also squeeze exporters’ profitability by decreasing profit margins (if the appreciation is not passed through to higher prices abroad). They investigated how exchange rates affect the profitability of Japanese firms and industries using monthly stock returns for 227 companies over the January 2005 to December 2009 period. They regressed stock returns on the percentage change in the exchange rate and also in one specification on the return on the overall Japanese stock market. For the chemical industry, they reported that when the return on the Japanese market is included in the regression, a 10% depreciation of the nominal yen/dollar exchange rate is associated with a 5% increase in returns on the overall chemical industry and slightly more than a 1% increase in returns on the medicinal chemical sector.====We disaggregate the chemical industry further to investigate whether exchange rates affect different parts of the industry differently. Ito, Koibuchi, Sato, and Shimizu (2018) observed that firms exporting differentiated products are better able to keep their yen exporting prices and thus their profit margins fixed, at least in the short run. We estimate the exposure of stock returns for 49 Japanese chemical firms to exchange rates. We find that Japanese chemical firms linked to industries such as automobiles are harmed when the yen appreciates. Ito, Koibuchi, Sato, and Shimizu reported that the automobile market in places like the U.S. is so competitive that Japanese automakers must invoice in the importing country’s currency. The automobile industry is thus exposed to yen appreciations. On the other hand, Japanese chemical firms producing complex products that few firms can produce are less exposed to appreciations.====Several researchers have examined the relationship between the technological sophistication of exports and exchange rate elasticities for Switzerland. Like Japan, Switzerland has an advanced industrial structure and exports sophisticated products. The International Monetary Fund (2013) observed that Swiss exports may face limited price competition because they are advanced and valued for their brands.====Auer and Sauré (2011) estimated exchange rate elasticities employing annual bilateral trade data between 24 OECD countries over the 1972–2000 period. They reported smaller responses to exchange rates for Swiss exports than for exports from other OECD countries. They explained this by noting that Swiss exports are concentrated in high quality goods such as pharmaceuticals that have low price elasticities. They also found smaller exchange rate elasticities for Swiss exports of advanced products such as centrifuges and milling machines than for Swiss exports of ubiquitous products such as clothing and fish fillets.====Thorbecke and Kato (2018) estimated exchange rate elasticities using annual data on Swiss exports in several categories to major importers over the 1989–2014 period. Employing panel dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) methods, they reported that exchange rates do not affect exports for sophisticated sectors such as pharmaceuticals and watches. On the other hand, they found that appreciations reduce exports of medium-high-technology products such as capital goods and machinery.====Grossmann, Lein, and Schmidt (2016) estimated exchange rate elasticities for Swiss exports using sector-specific trade data from 1989Q1 to 2014Q4. They examined exports of 12 sectors from Switzerland to 24 destinations that receive 83% of Switzerland’s exports. Employing an error correction model, they found that elasticities differ by sector. Agriculture, paper products, textiles and clothing, leather, and similar products have higher elasticities. Machinery and precision instruments have lower elasticities. Pharmaceuticals and chemicals have low elasticities.====In previous work on Singapore Arbatli and Hong (2016) investigated whether more complex exports as measured by the PCI have lower exchange rate elasticities. Employing a Mean Group estimator and annual data at the HS 4-digit level from 1989 to 2013, they reported that products with higher PCIs have lower elasticities.====In previous work on Japan, Baek (2013) used an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model over the 1991Q1–2010Q4 period and the CPI-deflated Japanese yen/Korean won exchange rate to investigate Japan’s exports to South Korea at the Standard Industrial Trade Classification (SITC) 1-digit level. He found that SITC 6 exports (e.g. leather, iron & steel, non-ferrous metals) have a long run elasticity of 1.64; SITC 2 exports (crude materials other than fuels) an elasticity of 1.37; SITC 3 exports (fuels) an elasticity of − 1.02; SITC 5 exports (chemicals) an elasticity of 0.94; and that SITC 7 (machinery and transportation equipment) and SITC 8 (e.g., furniture, luggage, footwear) exports are not affected by exchange rates. Baek posited that the zero exchange rate elasticity for machinery and transportation equipment occurred because these goods are essential for Korean firms to produce goods for re-export.====Sato, Shimizu, Shrestha and Zhang (2013) examined how Japanese exports in several International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) categories responded to rest of the world output and to industry-specific real effective exchange rates. They measured rest of the world output as a weighted average of 26 trading partners’ industrial production indices. They employed a monthly VAR over the January 2001 to February 2013 period and assumed that rest of the world output is strictly exogenous and that the exchange rate is not affected in the same month by shocks to exports. They reported that a positive shock to the industry-specific real effective exchange rate (yen appreciation) will decrease Japanese exports in the transportation equipment (ISIC 34–35), office machinery (ISIC 30), electrical apparatuses (ISIC 31), and communications (ISIC 30) sectors. The effect is largest for transportation equipment exports, followed by office machinery and then electrical machinery and is smallest for communications exports.====Kato (2015) used panel DOLS and annual data on Japanese exports to 26 countries over the 1995–2011 period to estimate elasticities. He examined Japanese exports of high skill & technology intensive manufacturing and medium skill & technology intensive manufacturing. He obtained data on exports by skill level from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. For high skill & technology intensive exports, DOLS estimates with heterogeneous time trends indicate that a 10% yen appreciation would reduce exports by 13.6%. For medium skill & technology intensive exports, DOLS estimates with heterogeneous trends indicate that an appreciation would not affect exports. Kato suggested that medium technology goods may not be sensitive to exchange rates because of their role in regional supply networks.====Bahmani-Oskooee and Karamelikli (2018) used linear and nonlinear ARDL models and quarterly data over the 1994Q1–2017Q1 period to examine the impact of changes in the yen on Japan’s trade balance with the U.S. For the chemical sector (HS 5), employing a linear model they reported that a yen appreciation (depreciation) would worsen (improve) the sectoral trade balance in the short run but not in the long run. Employing a nonlinear model, they found that a yen depreciation would worsen the sectoral balance in the short and long runs but that a yen appreciation would not affect the trade balance. They also reported a variety of effects on chemical products disaggregated into seven categories. In this paper we further disaggregate chemical exports into 93 categories to investigate why trade elasticities differ across different types of chemical products.====The next section uses trade data to estimate exchange rate elasticities for Japanese chemical exports. Section 3 employs stock return data to investigate the exchange rate exposure of Japanese chemical companies.

Several numerical results were obtained. First of all, the sectoral real GDPs of the aging-related sectors are expected to continue to increase due to the higher demand generated by the elderly, while the total real GDP is forecasted to start to decrease from year 2036 due to the shrinking population. Secondly, calculations show that nearly 60 million more workers will be needed in the private long-term care sector in year 2049 than in year 2018. Thirdly, if a 90 percent inflow of additionally needed labor force to the medical services sector were to be obstructed, the total real GDP would shrink by 0.064 percent. If the same inflow obstruction were to occur to the private long-term care sector, the total real GDP would shrink by 0.030 percent. Fourthly, while a negative impact of the inelastic ==== was seen in almost all simulations, the impact of an obstruction in the medical service sector was found to be positive for the pharmaceutical sector due to substitution effect. Finally, the inelastic ==== will not only reduce the Japanese economic performance but also welfare, the extent of which depends on the duration of labor immobility. Thus, it is crucial for future economic growth as well as welfare of aging Japan that the additionally needed labor inflow to all aging-related sectors occurs smoothly.","By combining the static and dynamic computable general equilibrium models, this paper explores the dynamic impact of the future demographic changes on the Japanese economy with a particular focus on multisector production and overlapping generations.====Rapid and drastic demographic changes are anticipated in the near future in Japan. The total population has already started to shrink, and the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (IPSS) forecasts the current 120 million population to decrease to less than 60 million in the next 100 years. Such drastic demographic changes induce substantial impacts, not only on the economic policies of the government but also on numerous production sectors in various ways. The dynamic impact on the financial aspects of the government schemes have been investigated by several studies (Kitao, 2015a, Kitao, 2015b, Hansen and Imrohoroğlu, 2016, Imrohoroğlu et al., 2016, Kitao, 2017, Kato, 2018, Imrohoroğlu et al., 2019, Kitao and Mikoshiba, 2020). However, the dynamic impact on the future economic structure has rarely been studied in the literature. By fusing the static and dynamic computable general equilibrium models, which were developed independently, this paper scrutinizes the dynamic impact of the aging population on the market structure with a particular focus on multisector production over time in very rapidly aging Japan.====As a result of the aging Japanese population inducing a shift in the demand for specialized services and products for the elderly, relatively strong impacts on the aging-related sectors providing such services and products are to be expected. This paper focuses on five private production sectors that are related to the care for the elderly: the pharmaceutical, medical service, public hygiene, social service, and long-term care sectors.==== When the demand for the commodities of these sectors are stimulated by the population aging exponentially, a smooth inflow of more labor into these sectors is crucial to match the rapidly increasing demand. This paper studies to what extent labor mobility (or immobility) among aging-related sectors affects future economic growth in Japan.====A realistic demographic structure is considered over time. Until year 2015, the actual demographic structure data is used. From year 2016, the latest population projection published by the IPSS in 2017 is used.====Regarding the scenarios of future economic policies, the assumptions in the latest version of ==== (EFPMLA: Cabinet Office of the Government of Japan, July 2021) are considered as much as possible to scrutinize the future economy.====By integrating the static and dynamic computable general equilibrium models, the following numerical results were found.====(1) Even under the assumption of stable economic growth, as made in EFPMLA by Cabinet Office of the Government of Japan, 2016 (2021), the total real GDP will decrease from year 2036 due to the shrinking total population.====(2) In spite of the population shrinkage, the sectoral real GDPs of all five aging-related sectors will increase due to the higher demand generated by the elderly. The positive impact of the population aging appears to be relatively strong until year 2050 in the medical service sector with its sectorial GDP peak value of 48,801 billion yen. The peak of 9158 billion yen in the social service sector will occur in year 2057. In the long-term care sector, its peak of 9906 billion yen is seen in year 2047. In year 2066 the sectorial real GDP of the pharmaceutical sector will reach its peak value of 1202 billion yen, while the peak value in the public hygiene sector will be 883 billion yen in year 2059.====(3) The labor income will increase in the aging-related sectors. In the medical service sector it will reach 2453 billion yen in year 2059, 8420 billion yen in year 2049 in the long-term care sector, 7965 billion yen in year 2059 in the social service sector, and 12,834 billion yen in year 2058 in the public hygiene sector.====(4) The impact of the aging population on the labor force in the long-term care sector is significant. In this sector 391.2 million workers will be needed in year 2049, which is nearly 60 million more than 334 million in year 2018.====(5) Flexible labor mobility among the aging-related sectors is crucial. If a 90% labor inflow to the medical service sector were to be obstructed, the total real GDP would shrink by 0.064%. If a 90% inflow to the long-term care sector were to be obstructed, the total real GDP would shrink by 0.030%.====(6) While the impact of the immobile labor force is negative in all four sectors, this is not the case for the pharmaceutical sector. Surprisingly, the sectorial real GDP has been found to expand by any obstruction in the medical service sector. The strong substitution effect between these two sectors is thought to cause this positive effect. If a 90% inflow to the medical service sector were to be obstructed, its sectoral GDP would increase by 0.256%.====(7) Welfare is also affected negatively by labor inflow obstructions. If the duration of labor immobility is prolonged, the welfare of overlapping generations decreases in tact with the duration. If a labor inflow obstruction were to start in year 2022, the greatest decrease in welfare would be for the cohort entering the labor market in that year, namely the cohort born in 2002. If a 90% inflow to the medical service sector were to be obstructed in that same year, it would induce a 0.064% decrease in the utility of this cohort. The implication is that the duration of the obstruction will affect not only the economic performance measured by GDP, but also welfare.====This paper is organized as follows: The next section reviews the literature; Section 3 introduces the model developed in this paper in detail; Section 4 explains the assumptions made about the future economy; Section 5 numerically presents the impact of the population aging; Section 6 examines the impact of the inelastic labor mobility between aging-related sectors; and Section 7 concludes the paper.",Population aging and labor mobility in Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142522000160,6 April 2022,2022,Research Article,22.0

We empirically examined the impact of COVID-19 on the services trade using quarterly data from 146 countries in 2019 and 2020. Its severity is measured according to the number of cases, the number of deaths, and an index measuring the severity of lockdown orders. We found that the pandemic had a more significantly negative impact on the services trade than the goods trade, particularly on the import side. Moreover, the extent of the impact varied among disaggregated services sectors, reflecting the nature of services.

According to the ====, ====), services now generate more than two-thirds of all economic output, attract over two-thirds of foreign direct investment (FDI), provide the most jobs globally (almost two-thirds of all jobs in developing countries and four-fifths in developed countries), and account for over 40% of global trade in value-added terms. These numbers definitely confirm the importance of the services sector.====This study aims to quantitatively examine the impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the trade in services. It is well-known that the services trade is resilient to external shocks, especially compared to the goods trade. The resilient nature of the services trade could be observed during the 2008–2009 global financial crisis (GFC). During the GFC, while the trade in goods experienced a sharp drop, the trade in services hardly changed. Several studies have empirically investigated this resilience in the services trade during the GFC. They have demonstrated that this could be attributed to the low sensitivity of the services trade to demand shocks, a lower cyclical demand for a range of traded services, and less dependence on external financing (====, ====, ====). Based on this experience, we might expect an ongoing shock like the COVID-19 pandemic to have a negligible effect on the trade in services.====However, unlike past shocks, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a serious effect on the services trade. Indeed, as we later show, while the global trade in goods returned to a normal level by the end of 2020, the trade in services has not yet done so. One of the most distinctive features of this pandemic is how it has forced us to introduce mobility restrictions and social distancing measures for public health reasons. This creates a drastic effect, especially on the trade in services, because unlike the trade in goods, some services trade requires physical proximity between suppliers and consumers and the cross-border mobility. For instance, services trade that is categorized into modes 2 and 4 by the WTO ==== (GATS) requires cross-border mobility of consumers and suppliers, respectively. Thus, restrictive orders on cross-border mobility will have a more serious impact on the services trade. Moreover, this impact may vary among service sectors/subsectors, depending on whether or not physical proximity between suppliers and consumers is necessary and whether or not an online supply is available.====To examine the impact of COVID-19 on exports and imports of services, we employ quarterly data for 146 countries in 2019 and 2020. By including trade during the pre-pandemic period (i.e., 2019) in our study sample, we identify the effects of COVID-19 on the trade in services. Due to the current availability of global data, the services data we use are not those on bilateral trade but those on exports to, or imports from, the world. The severity of COVID-19′s damages is measured by the number of newly confirmed cases, the number of deaths, or a severity index on the policies that restrict behavior. To control for unobservable factors, we introduce various types of fixed effects. In addition, to capture their features more clearly, we compare them to the impact on the trade in goods. Furthermore, we quantitatively estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the services trade by sector/subsector and explore the possibility of sectoral heterogeneity of the effects, if any. We estimate these models using the Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) method.====Our main findings are summarized as follows. The spread of COVID-19 had a negative impact on services exports and imports. This result does not change, even when we address endogeneity in our COVID-19 variables. Further, we demonstrate that the degree of the impact varies among disaggregated service sectors, reflecting the nature of services. Travel services that rely heavily on mode 2 were affected the most, followed by transport services. Although transport services are primarily categorized as mode 1, ==== services are directly connected to the cross-border movement of people (mode 2 or mode 4), and freight transport services are both directly and indirectly connected to the cross-border movement of people and goods. Construction services that may largely depend on mode 4 in our dataset have also been affected, though trade values are small. The harmful effects on trade in these services, in particular, were more serious than those on the goods trade. Conversely, other service sectors that are typically provided through mode 1, such as computer-related services, had almost no significant effect.====; ====, ====, ====; ====; and ====). These studies have found that the severity of COVID-19′s damages in both exporting and importing countries led to a decreasing trade in goods. They also showed the propagation of such negative effects throughout supply chains. However, there are few studies on the trade in services. Two studies have conducted descriptive analyses on the services trade in India (====) and Spain (====). Thus, this study is the first to systematically investigate the association between COVID-19 and the trade in services using global data and to conduct a comparison with the trade in goods.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The main research method used is an in-depth literature review, while a bibliometric analysis and the path-dependence framework support it in the selection of relevant material. The keiretsu predecessors were the zaibatsu – large family-controlled conglomerates that came into prominence during the Meiji Period. The two traditional types of keiretsu are horizontal (financial) networks and vertical (industrial) networks. The key elements of the keiretsu system are the main banks, sōgō shōsha, shachō-kai (for horizontal keiretsu), and kyōryoku-kai (for vertical keiretsu). Text network analysis reveals four main themes in the literature: “Japan and the global economy,” “financial institutions of Japan,” “the theory of the keiretsu,” and “the characteristics of the Japanese firms.” The keiretsu had a positive influence on the Japanese economy during the post-war period of high economic growth. As the economy of Japan slowed down in the 1990 s, the gains from keiretsu membership became less unequivocal – which prompted a wave of ==== and modernization."," networks are one of the staples of the post-war Japanese economy. A keiretsu is a complex network of firms connected by cross-shareholdings and informal business relations, with a single commercial bank in the middle (also known as the main bank). The keiretsu were at the forefront of economic research in the 1980 s when many Western scholars tried to explain the causes of Japan’s competitive advantage. Keiretsu membership was especially beneficial for automotive and electronics manufacturing, which were Japan’s primary exports. Since the 1990 s, the Japanese economy entered its “lost decades” period. Rapid technological and the globalization of value and supply chains changed the world economy. As the years went by, giant technology corporations from the United States started to dominate global markets. The once envied Japanese keiretsu groups seemingly no longer held their uncanny advantage. However, the keiretsu remain relevant today, as the series of mergers boosted their international competitiveness.",The evolution of Japanese keiretsu networks: A review and text network analysis of their perceptions in economics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142522000184,7 March 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

The results showed that the unsubsidized-local projects were the most productive among the three types. In addition, the subsidized-local projects were found to be the least productive, being less effective than the central projects. This may suggest the existence of inefficiency factors that central subsidization for local projects entails under the Japanese system of ====.","Since the pioneering works of Kato (1967), Nose (1973), and Mera (1973), and especially after the influential study by Aschauer (1989), research on the productivity of public capital has progressed in Japan. Many studies estimate the public capital elasticity of regional products at the macroeconomic level. As summarized in Appendix 1, these studies corroborate the positive public capital elasticity and its decline since the mid-1970 s. Some studies further evaluated elasticity by region and industry. Studies carried out by region have shown that public capital elasticity is higher in urban areas than in rural areas (e.g., Honma and Tanaka, 2004; Yoshino and Nakano, 1996), and studies examined by industry indicated a public capital elasticity gap among industries (e.g., Ida and Yoshida, 1999, Yoshino et al., 1999a). Studies have also evaluated the economic effects of public capital using vector autoregression (e.g., Doi, 1998; Hatano, 2000; Hayashi, 2004), and have assessed the effect of public capital on the total factor productivity (e.g., Higuchi et al., 2003; Takenaka and Isikawa, 1991). Further, other studies have focused on the effect of public capital on economic convergence (e.g., Fukao and Yue, 2000; Nakazato, 1999; Shioji, 2000, Shioji, 2001).====However, with the exception of Kameda and Li (2008), no study has examined the effect of public capital by “project type.” Public capital in Japan is formed by different levels of government through public investments. While there are large-scale projects directly implemented by the central government, which are referred to as “central-government projects” (Kuni-Chokkatsu Jigyo), there are also projects that are implemented by local governments (i.e., prefectures and municipalities). Among such local projects, some are induced through subsidies by the central government, whereas others are not. The former are referred to as “subsidized-local projects” (Hojo Jigyo) and the latter as “unsubsidized-local projects” (Tandoku Jigyo).====Using the same dataset that are used by Kameda and Li (2008), this study examines the effects on regional production of these three different types of infrastructure projects.==== By doing so, it contributes to the literature on fiscal federalism. Several studies recommend a decentralized approach to the provision of infrastructure (Kahkonen and Lanyi, 2001, Ahmad and Brosio, 2009), since decentralization may provide better matching of preferences and needs (Oates, 1972) and increase accountability (Seabright, 1996), which also implies that central subsidies might cause inefficiencies. Based on this line of argument, we would expect unsubsidized projects by local governments (i.e., more autonomous decentralized local project) results in higher production effects. Meanwhile, there may be inefficiencies in infrastructure policy that are related to benefit spillovers and/or the limitation of economies of scale. If spillovers and/or scale economies are important, infrastructure projects that are subsidized or directly implemented by the central government might outperform locally implemented unsubsidized projects. Despite the importance of the fiscal federalism argument on infrastructure policy, however, there are only a small number of studies that analyze the effectiveness of these arrangements of infrastructure policy (Hulten and Schwab, 1997, Kappeler et al., 2013, Guccio et al., 2014).====This study also improves on the existing Japanese studies by allowing for the econometric issues that had not been addressed properly. A number of empirical studies in the literature utilize a panel of regional (prefectural) data where time-series periods and cross-section units are almost equal in their numbers. For example, Kameda and Li (2008) use a panel of 46 prefectures whose time-series data run from 1960 to 2003 (i.e., 44 years). However, if time series variables are nonstationary in a panel with comparable sizes between time-series and cross-section dimensions, statistical inference with the OLS estimator could be misleading. For example, if there is no cointegrating relation among the non-stationary variables, the coefficient estimators yield nondegenerate limit distributions and their estimates may be characterized as spurious (Phillips and Moon, 1999). This problem might be present in some of the previous studies, and definitely be so. To allow for the non-stationarity of the data (if any), we use the methods of the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) as in Santiago et al. (2020). To anticipate our result, our main conclusion is that the most effective public capital to regional GDP was that of unsubsidized-local projects.====The main findings are anticipated as follows. First, the most effective public capital to regional GDP was that of unsubsidized-local projects, while the marginal products of public capital in the central-government and subsidized-local projects were relatively small. Second, comparing their marginal products to the private ones, the public capital of all three projects was undersupplied in our first sample period, 1960–1987. Third, public capital in subsidized-local projects was oversupplied, whereas that in unsubsidized-local projects was undersupplied in the second period, 1988–2003. Fourth, these findings did not change when differences between urban and rural areas and the presence of spillover effects were taken into consideration. These results suggest the existence of inefficiency factors under the Japanese centralized intergovernmental transfer system: soft budget constraints for subsidized-local projects and excessive hard budget constraints for unsubsidized-local projects.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. 2 Data, 3 Estimation strategy explain the data and estimation strategies, respectively. Section 4 presents the results of the empirical analysis, and Section 5 discusses the results. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions and policy implications of the study.","Comparison of the productivity of public capital by project type: Central-government, subsidized-local, and unsubsidized-local projects in Japan",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142522000056,31 January 2022,2022,Research Article,25.0

As municipalities have discretion when setting the NHI premiums, they may determine their premiums observing how large or small the premiums of their neighbors are. This study examined how such reference behavior affects the NHI premium level and to what extent it explains the premium disparities. The results revealed that there was positive reference behavior among neighboring insurers which explains 7.2% of the NHI premium disparity.","The Japanese system of public health insurance is universal, consisting of three types: (i) employment-based programs for employees and their families, (ii) residence-based programs, and (iii) the Medical Care System for the Elderly (MCSE) for those aged 75 and older. The National Health Insurance (NHI) is the residence-based program, covering those who are excluded from the other two types of public health insurance.====In the NHI, municipalities are the main insurers.==== At the end of the fiscal year (FY) 2017, there were 1716 municipal insurers in the NHI, covering 27% of the population under the age of 75 (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), 2020c). The NHI is noteworthy for its fragile financial base owing to the aging of the insured, resulting in high medical expenditure and their low-income levels compared to those enrolled in the other types of public health insurance. Each municipality imposes its own NHI premiums. If the cost of insurance benefits increases, the amount to be collected as premiums is also expected to increase. Meanwhile, the lower level of the insured individual’s income puts downward pressure on premiums that can be levied. Although those aged 75 and older are enrolled in the MCSE, the ageing of the insured and their low incomes are straining the NHI finances, both in terms of increasing medical expenditures and reducing premiums that can be charged.====Owing to its weak financial base, the NHI receives large-scale fiscal transfers, which take various forms including national and prefectural subsidies, intra-municipal transfers, and the cost-sharing scheme among different systems of public health insurance of which the NHI is a part. Obviously, these transfers do not cover all the costs for the NHI benefits. The extent of the deficits varies considerably across municipalities, and so does the extent to which premiums are adjusted to compensate for such deficits. Therefore, despite occupying a rather small portion of the total revenue (19.8% in FY2017), the NHI premiums exhibit a considerable disparity among municipalities (Kitaura, 2007, Tanaka, 2005). In other words, the NHI is designed to allow for disparities in premiums. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the municipal premiums,==== each of which was evaluated at the national average income (MHLW 2020a). The highest was imposed by Tenshio, Hokkaido (190,870 yen), which was approximately 3.4 times the lowest imposed by Mikura Island, Tokyo (56,234 yen).====Limited studies have analyzed regional disparities in the NHI premiums across Japan, and the factors affecting such disparities remain unclear. There are possibly two sets of factors that affect the disparities in the NHI premiums: structural factors inherent to the NHI system and discretionary factors under the control of the insurers. The former includes medical costs and the insured individuals’ ability to bear premiums (i.e., income). If regional disparities in premiums can be explained only by such factors, these can be resolved by reviewing subsidy allocation and correcting disparities in per capita medical costs through a healthcare system reform.====If only the two structural factors determined the premiums, with other things being equal, higher medical costs would automatically hike up the premiums to finance the benefits, while lower income of the insured would mechanically reduce the premiums. In other words, the correlations between premiums and medical costs and between premiums and income are expected to be positive. However, such an expectation seems to hold only partially. While Panel a in Fig. 2 shows a positive correlation between the premiums and per capita medical expenditure with a coefficient of 0.376, Panel b shows a ==== correlation between the premiums and the per capita income with a coefficient of − 0.291. Furthermore, netting out the effect of the correlation between medical expenditure and income, the partial correlation of premiums with per capita income again shows a negative sign with − 0.174, while that of premiums with per capita medical expenditure is 0.300. This implies that the current regional disparity of the NHI premiums may be influenced by discretionary factors other than the non-discretionary elements inherent in the system. The purpose of this study is to identify what drives such discretion and to what extent it contributes to the disparity of the NHI premiums.====Since the NHI premiums are believed to be higher than those paid by individuals enrolled in the other types of public health insurance (Tanaka, 2005), municipalities (i.e., the insurers) may wish to keep their NHI premiums as low as possible to avoid political criticism from the insured residents (Ando and Takaku, 2016). One method is to extract as many subsidies from the upper levels of governments and the cost-sharing scheme with other types of public health insurance as possible, thereby avoiding increases in their own premiums. However, by the very statutory design of the relevant transfer mechanism, municipalities can hardly implement such an option. Perhaps, the only option available for municipalities is to take advantage of inter-account transfers ==== a municipality, i.e., intra-municipal transfers, which reallocate funds from the tax-financed general accounts to the premium-financed NHI accounts. Discretionary changes in the premium level are obviously related to the availability of such intra-municipal transfers (Nishizawa, 2015, Ando and Takaku, 2016).====The pressure to adjust the premiums may be accelerated through interaction with other municipalities. The insured residents would wish to pay their premiums as low as those do in neighboring municipalities. Simultaneously, to avoid political criticism of residents, municipalities would emphasize the appropriateness of their policies by comparing their premiums to those in neighboring municipalities. Such “herd behavior” may constitute an important element in the discretionary factor in explaining the different levels of NHI premiums. In the literature, the existence of policy interdependence among local governments has been demonstrated using the yardstick competition model (Besley and Case, 1995, Caldeira, 2012), the resource-flow models (Brueckner, 2003), and the spillover model of public benefits (Williams, 1966, Brueckner, 2003). Particularly important from the analysis of local governments in Japan is the information spillover effect, a type of yardstick competition (Nakazawa, 2007).====This study thus aims to identify empirically, using premium estimates for each insurer, whether the NHI premiums are influenced by the exercise of discretion of insurers, which cannot be attributed to the medical costs per capita or the income status of the insured. Specifically, this study focuses on the impact of the premiums set by neighboring municipalities and its contributions to the variance (i.e., disparity) of the NHI premiums. The results show that the impact would be positive and explain 7.2% of the variations of the NHI premiums. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the institutional background and regional differences in premiums. Section 3 presents the analytical methodology. The data and their sources are explained in Section 4.

Japan’s price adjustment program is designed to support the domestic sugar ==== by imposing a tariff on imports and by subsidizing domestic production using tariff revenues. This study compared the program and a subsidy scheme using benefit/cost ratios and the degree of trade distortion. The main findings and their policy implications are as follows: 1) because the benefit/cost ratio for the program is greater than one, the program would be beneficial for Japanese people, 2) the ratios and trade distortions for the two policies are similar, thus the program works well when fiscal spending is constrained, as it requires less government spending, 3) using tariffs instead of the other two policies results in a smaller benefit/cost ratio and greater market distortion, 4) people are uncertain about their preference for the program, making them more accepting of it.","Governments of developed countries support the domestic agriculture sector to allow producers to internalize positive externalities, such as food security, rural viability, and environmental benefits. Domestic agricultural support policies can be categorized as either tariffs or subsidies. A subsidies policy includes payments based on output, area planted, or number of animals; this is the best policy for internalizing positive externalities because subsidies distort only production (Karp and Perloff, 2002). Tariffs, however, distort both consumption and production. Fiscally constrained governments prefer tariffs over subsidies, as tariffs generate government revenue while subsidies are government expenditures (e.g., Ederington and Minier, 2006; Sakuyama, 2010). The purpose of this study is to indicate effective and sensible domestic agricultural support policies.====Sugar is one of the most policy distorted of all commodities, and the European Union, Japan, and the United States are among the worst offenders (Mitchell, 2004). Governments protect domestic sugar production from foreign competition because there is no quality difference in sugar based on production area, and thus, product differentiation is very difficult. Domestic and imported sugar are perfect substitutes and only the lowest-priced sugar remains in the market.====Therefore, this study focuses on Japan’s price adjustment program, designed to support domestic sugar production and allow producers to internalize positive externalities such as food security and rural viability. It is unique because it combines tariffs and subsidies. The Japanese government argues that domestically produced sugar is an impure public good, and that consumers enjoy both public and private benefits (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries MAFF, 2011). The program imposes a tariff on imported sugar and uses this revenue to subsidize domestic production, thus ensuring that the prices of domestic and imported sugar match. This program is applied to both sugar and starch. Using tariff revenues to compensate domestic producers affected by the tariff reductions so that they will accept these tariff reductions is rare; the United States’ National Wool Act of 1954 is the only other example of such a policy (Baldwin, 1982). To the best of our knowledge, the Act on Price Adjustment of Sugar and Starch in Japan and the National Wool Act in the United States are the only policies that have used tariff revenue as a source of subsidy expenditure.====In this study, we compare the program’s performance with a production subsidy scheme. Using game theory, Feenstra and Bhagwati (1982) showed that, when a decrease in the relative price of imports triggers tariff lobbying activity by labor, and the government has a limited ability to persuade labor due to budget constraints, the government can improve social welfare by granting some tariff protection and using the tariff revenues to directly compensate labor. To our knowledge, no study has empirically evaluated a policy that both imposes a tariff on imports and compensates an industry that competes with imports using this tariff revenue. Most countries face fiscal challenges due to COVID-19 and governments are unable to subsidize producers. Thus, a price adjustment program that also functions as a subsidy scheme is both effective and sensible, as it requires less government spending than a subsidy scheme does.====The World Trade Organization (WTO) distinguishes agricultural policies and subsidies based on two criteria: (1) whether they are targeted to support the multifunctional roles (positive externalities) of agriculture and (2) whether they distort trade patterns (Moon et al., 2017). We therefore evaluate the performance of the program based on two criteria: (1) benefit/cost ratio and (2) degree of trade distortion. The benefit/cost ratio is the ratio of the public benefit that Japanese people enjoy from the positive externalities of domestic sugar production to the cost of the program that they incur as consumers or taxpayers. The higher the benefit/cost ratio, the more efficiently the policy supports positive externalities. Modern manifestations of mercantilist thinking abound (e.g., General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and WTO), and their concern with trade volumes is an important constraint in policy formation (Anderson and Neary, 2003). Therefore, we measure trade distortion as the difference between trade volumes under the program and those under free trade.====To evaluate the benefit, we conduct a hypothetical choice experiment. The respondents choose to buy either imported or domestic sugar when there is no quality difference between them. We then estimate consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for domestic sugar as an impure public good. The WTP reflects the benefits of the positive externalities of domestic sugar production.====Previous studies measuring WTP for domestic agricultural products (e.g., Chung et al., 2009; Peterson and Yoshida, 2004) obtained values based on the quality difference that consumers perceive between domestic and foreign products. However, refined sugar products are 99.9% sucrose (C====H====O====), with water as the principal non-sucrose component (Colonna et al., 2006). Therefore, we can assume that there is no quality difference between domestic and foreign sugar. This study is novel because it measures consumers’ WTP for the positive externalities produced jointly with agricultural products, thanks to this distinct property of sugar. Unrefined sugar such as brown sugar is excluded from the price adjustment program, because its quality varies according to the production area and product differentiation can be made. Therefore, our analysis excludes unrefined sugar.====Another novel aspect of this study is that it considers positive externalities as well as surplus loss. While some studies derived the surplus loss caused by sugar policies using the partial equilibrium model (e.g., Beghin and Elobeid, 2015; Leu et al., 1987; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2007; United States General Accounting Office, 2000; Wohlgenant, 2011) and general equilibrium model (Van Der Mensbrugghe et al., 2003). However, none have yet compared the benefits and costs of such a domestic sugar policy.====As a key feature, this study considers preference uncertainty for measuring the WTP by using subjective choice probability data. Existing literature argues that consumers may have difficulty in unambiguously choosing the best option in choice experiments because of preference uncertainty (Berrens et al., 2002, Blass et al., 2010, Li and Mattsson, 1995, Ready et al., 1995), unfamiliarity with alternatives (Berrens et al., 2002, Li and Mattsson, 1995), or incomplete scenarios (Blass et al., 2010, Manski, 1999). The respondents in our choice experiments may suffer from preference uncertainty because few of them have experience making decisions about purchasing impure public goods. To address this, we use their subjective choice probability data (Berrens et al., 2002, Blass et al., 2010, Li and Mattsson, 1995). We also measure the WTP for domestic sugar using conventional discrete choice data, which allows us to assess the impact of consumers’ preference uncertainty on domestic agricultural support policies.",Comparison of the price adjustment program and subsidy scheme in Japan: Evaluation of domestic sugar support policy to internalize positive externalities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142522000044,31 January 2022,2022,Research Article,27.0

It is found that the ETI with regard to the net-of-tax rate is approximately 0.158–0.226, considerably lower than those for the United States and many European countries. One possible reason for the small ETI estimates is the absence of the behavioral response in terms of choice of deductions in this study.","Most OECD countries comprehensively reformed their income tax systems in the 1980s, including substantial declines in the marginal tax rates and changes in the tax bases. Given these wide-scale tax reforms, academic researchers have shown interest in the extent to which taxable income responds to changes in the marginal tax rates of income tax. The pioneering work by Lindsey (1987) addresses the response of taxable income to the Economic Reform Tax Act of 1981 by using cross-sectional data on US taxpayers and estimates the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) with respect to the tax policy change as being 1.6–1.8. Feldstein (1995) assesses the ETI by using individual-level panel data and a natural experiment in income tax reform, namely the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86), and estimates an ETI greater than 1. While that study piqued other researchers’ interest in ETI estimation, it raised some conceptual concerns regarding the measurement of the ETI. Indeed, although the use of taxpayer panel data has provided researchers with an opportunity to undertake a richer examination of the ETI, it could raise the problem of mean reversion in transitory income (e.g., Auten and Carroll, 1999; Gruber and Saez, 2002).====Given the background of this academic debate, Gruber and Saez (2002) propose a more comprehensive and standard estimation model, which has since been used widely by a number of empirical researchers, to address the aforementioned empirical issues. More recently, a variant of the Gruber–Saez model was developed to address empirical issues on which Gruber and Saez (2002) do not focus. For example, Kopczuk (2005) introduces a model that highlights the definition of taxable income as a factor that leads to an overestimation of the ETI given the wide availability of tax deductions and declining marginal tax rates. Many researchers have attempted to estimate the taxable income elasticity with regard to the net-of-tax rate correctly from an empirical viewpoint.====In estimation of the ETI, tax base change is a major concern (Kopczuk, 2005, Slemrod and Kopczuk, 2002). Previous works have drawn attention to a margin from changes in the definition of tax base along with a substantial tax reform and state that the margin generally appears in the difference between the elasticities of taxable income and broad income (see, for example, Gruber and Saez, 2002). There are two sources of the difference: the behavioral response and the mechanical effect (Kopczuk, 2005, Gruber and Saez, 2002). The behavioral response is that taxpayers alter their itemization status in response to income tax changes, resulting in changes in taxable income and thus a margin of the estimated elasticities. Gruber and Saez (2002) state that the behavioral response accounts for about 60% of the margin between the two elasticities. As for the behavioral response, in Japan an itemized deduction was essentially not available for salaried workers in the sample period. Itemized deduction was first introduced in Japan in 1988 as part of the 1987–1989 comprehensive tax reform. Although after 1989, salaried workers could choose between standard and itemized deductions for themselves, they had not utilized the itemized deduction because of the presence of relatively large amounts of standard deduction.==== The use of Japanese tax return data allows us to remove the estimation margin caused by the behavioral response to deduction changes from the ETI estimates.====In addition, the present study estimates the ETI without potential concern about small estimates of broad income elasticity. To cope with a margin from tax base changes, recent researchers have attempted to measure the elasticity of broad income, which is by definition not susceptible to tax deduction changes, rather than that of taxable income (e.g., Kleven and Schulz, 2014; Kopczuk, 2005). However, owing to the “mechanical factor,” the broad income elasticity could probably be smaller than the ETI. Here, the “mechanical factor” means that the broad income elasticity is likely to be small due to large size of broad income, or large denominator in the elasticity calculation (Gruber and Saez, 2002, p.17).==== The mechanical factor explains about 40% of the gap between the two elasticities. Therefore, estimation of the ETI is still valuable in light of comparability with the existing ETI estimates. Consequently, our primary contribution is to estimate the ETI absent a potential margin from changes in tax base definition and problems with estimates of broad income elasticity, using Japanese tax return data and radical personal income tax reform.====Additionally, the Japanese data have desirable property in the sense that the distribution of top Japanese wage income was stable throughout the sample period, or the late 1980s (See Moriguchi and Saez, 2008, Figure 11). Because top US income distribution was volatile during the period of TRA86, researchers have to deal with estimation biases such as mean reversion and heterogeneous income trends carefully.====This study aims to estimate the ETI with regard to the net-of-tax rate precisely in terms of potential for choice of deductions, using panel tax return data from top Japanese taxpayers in Tokyo during 1986–1989. From the published list of top Japanese taxpayers, we collected those who tax-paid more than 10 million JPY (about 100 thousand USD) in nominal value in all the sample years and whose earnings mainly came from labor income. The sample is then restricted to the substantially high income earners, specifically ones with taxable incomes of more than 31.7 million JPY in real value. This study focuses on the personal income tax policy changes caused by the 1987–1989 comprehensive tax reform in Japan, which substantially reduced top marginal income tax rates. Regression equations are based on the approach pioneered by Gruber and Saez (2002), which deals with endogeneity due to a progressive taxation by an instrumental variable strategy and incorporates log of lagged taxable income as a control to solve the problems with mean reversion and changes in income distribution. However, the Gruber-Saez model may generate a biased estimation given that its instrumental variable, calculated from one year lagged taxable income, and base year income, or the lagged taxable income, could be correlated with unobservable errors in the estimation equation (Weber, 2014). As proposed by Weber (2014), therefore, we use two year lagged taxable income for a calculation of the instrumental variable and as a base year income.====The estimation shows that the ETI with regard to the net-of-tax rate ranges from 0.158 to 0.226 in Japan. A baseline estimation generated the ETI estimate of approximately 0.158, and many of the subsequent regressions demonstrated similar ETI coefficients. The finding suggests that the ETI for top Japanese taxpayers is smaller than those of other countries such as Canada (i.e., 0.25) (Sillamaa and Veall, 2001), Germany (i.e., 0.54–0.68) (Doerrenberg et al., 2017), Hungary (i.e., 0.24) (Kiss and Mosberger, 2015), Sweden==== (i.e., 0.4–0.5) (Hansson, 2007), and the United States in the 1980s (i.e., 0.4) (Gruber and Saez, 2002) or (i.e., 0.86) (Weber, 2014) and in the 1990s (i.e., 0.26) (Giertz, 2007), but larger than that in Denmark (i.e., 0.066) (Kleven and Schultz, 2014) or ambiguous to that in Norway (i.e., −0.6 to 0.2) (Aarbu and Thoresen, 2001). In general, the ETI is likely to be larger when the sample is restricted to higher income earners. Now that Kleven and Schultz (2014) estimate the ETI for all the taxpayers who are tax-liable for the sample period, the magnitude of the ETI for top Japanese taxpayers is small relative to those of other countries. One possible reason is the absence of the behavioral response in terms of choice of deductions. As stated above, in Japan there was effectively no possibility that taxpayers chose between standard and itemized deductions. Another possibility is the small elasticity of labor supply for male. It is common that the labor supply elasticity for male is slight and close to zero (Blundell and MaCurdy, 1999, Saez et al., 2012).====Turning to Japan, few empirical studies have focused on labor supply responses to tax policy changes for prime-age men (see, for example, Bessho and Hayashi, 2005), and the results of analyses of labor supply responses of prime-age men have been not definitive (Bessho and Hayashi, 2011). Meanwhile, some empirical studies have paid close attention to estimation of the labor supply effects of spousal allowance and find significant responsiveness of labor force participation for married women (Akabayashi, 2006; Bessho and Hayashi, 2014; Yamada, 2011). Some studies have addressed the link between the marginal cost of public funds and personal income tax in Japan (Bessho and Hayashi, 2005, Bessho and Hayashi, 2013, Bessho and Hayashi, 2015).==== Overall, because male accounts for 96% of our sample, the conventional result of the small elasticity for male also could provide support for the low ETI estimates obtained in this research.====Some ETI studies have been carried out in Japan, although most of them use neither panel nor tax return data, nor do they address the large-scale personal tax reform of the late 1980s. Using the microdata from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, Cabinet Office Japan (2001) estimates the ETI during the 1995 tax reform to be 0.074, and Kitamura and Miyazaki, 2010 estimate the ETI during the 1995 and 1999 tax reforms to be 0.2–0.28. Based on the panel microdata in Japan, or the Japan Household panel Survey, Kurita (2019) obtains the ETI estimates of around 0.7. Besides, using aggregate tax return data, Yashio (2005) estimates the ETI during the 1999 tax reform to be 0.053. Unlike previous studies in the literature, Uemura et al. (2016) estimate the ETI for elderly people of − 11.908 – − 2.544 from the Longitudinal Survey of Middle-aged and Elderly Persons. It follows that our estimates of the ETI appear to be within the range of estimates of previous studies.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

This study analyzes the differing effects of the tax rate reduction and depreciation method reform by conducting simulations to represent the effects of each reform on the EATR and EMTR. Japan's tax reform in the 2010 s reduced both EATR and EMTR by lowering tax rates. The reform of depreciation methods had little effect on EATR and raised EMTR, but had a limited effect on companies with eligible depreciable assets. The overall effect of the ==== reform is that the effect of the tax rate reduction exceeded that of the depreciation method reforms, and thus the EMTR also declined.","This study evaluates Japan's corporate income tax reforms through the 2010 s using firm-level financial data to estimate the effective corporate income tax rates. According to Steinmüller et al. (2019), who compare the statutory corporate income tax rates of countries worldwide, from the late 1990 s to the early 2010 s, Japan had one of the highest statutory tax rates in the world. Therefore, some argued that corporate income tax rates should be lowered to recover from the aftereffects of the Great Recession and strengthen the international competitiveness of companies. Thus, the Japanese government decided to lower the corporate income tax rate starting in FY2012.====The policy goal at the time was to reduce the effective statutory tax rate to the 20% range. This is a tax rate calculated by combining the national and local statutory tax rates and used as an indicator by Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) for international comparison. The national corporate income tax rate for large corporations with capital of 100 million yen or more was reduced from 30% in FY2011 to 23.2% in FY2018. The local corporate income tax rate was also reduced. Hence, the effective statutory tax rate, which was over 40% in the early 2000 s, fell to 29.74% in FY2019.====However, it is unclear whether the decline in the statutory corporate income tax rate led to a decline in the effective corporate income tax rates. Since the tax burden paid by firms depends on their tax planning activities, the statutory effective tax rate does not necessarily indicate the tax burden ratio of firms. The ratio of tax burden to corporate profits is the backward-looking effective tax rate, which is affected by the tax planning activities of the corporation. Therefore, the backward-looking effective tax rate has an endogeneity problem. On the other hand, EATR and EMTR, based on a series of studies such as Devereux and Griffith (2003), calculate the effective tax rate for a fictitious future investment project. These are called forward-looking effective tax rates and are known to be an indicator that is not affected by corporate tax planning.====The EATR is the tax burden on normal profits and excess profits of the firm's future investment project. The tax base for determining the EATR tax burden is reduced by deductions from the depreciation system. As with EATR, the tax base for determining the tax burden of EMTR is reduced by the depreciation deduction. Therefore, both EATR and EMTR are effective tax rates that differ from the effective statutory tax rate, which is unaffected by the tax base. In general, EATR is considered to affect a company's location choice, while EMTR is considered to affect the size of investment given the location of investment.====This study’s primary contribution to the literature is the calculation of the effective average tax rate (EATR) and the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) developed in the pioneering work by Devereux and Griffith (2003). I use this data to evaluate Japan's corporate tax reforms in the 2010 s====As lowering the tax rates would reduce tax revenue, the Japanese government expanded the tax base by changing the depreciation method. Analyzing this aspect of the tax reform is the second contribution of this study. In FY2007, Japan abolished the old declining-balance method and introduced the 250% decline balance method with a switch to straight-line (250%DBSL) for depreciable assets other than buildings. While this method is a very accelerated depreciation mechanism, it also eroded the tax base. Therefore, it was changed to the 200% decline balance method with a switch to straight-line (200%DBSL) in FY2011, and the legal depreciation method for structures changed from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method in FY2016. However, the statutory corporate income tax rate does not capture these changes in the depreciation system. In particular, EMTR is closely related to firm's investment decision makings, which cannot be captured by the statutory tax rate alone. Instead, I must evaluate them using EATR and EMTR estimates, though doing so requires an analysis of the asset composition of each company.====Starting with Devereux and Griffith (2003), several studies provided EATR and EMTR estimates for various countries (Suzuki, 2014, Hanappi, 2018, Steinmüller et al., 2019, Millot et al., 2020, Spengel et al., 2020), thereby establishing the estimation method. Egger et al. (2009), Egger, Loretz, (2010), Steinmüller et al. (2019), and Federici et al. (2020) estimate firm-specific EATR and EMTR using financial statement data. The advantage of using financial data for individual companies is that it allows for the consideration of asset composition and funding diversity. Prior studies point out that EATR and EMTR vary by country and firm. While I use methods from these prior studies to estimate the EATR and EMTR, this study contributes to this research stream by estimating the effective corporate tax rates at the firm level using data from the individual financial statements of Japanese listed companies.====In summary, this study estimates the EATR and EMTR by modeling national and local corporate tax rates in accordance with Japanese tax law. Second, the analysis reflects the asset composition and financing of Japanese firms. Third, I assume values for key economic variables, such as the real interest rate and the inflation rate, based on the economic situation in Japan to estimate more realistic EATR and EMTR values. Many previous studies use the same real interest rate and inflation rate for each country for international comparisons. This study compares the more realistic case for Japan to the assumptions often applied for international comparisons.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and data sources, and Section 3 presents the preliminary data. Section 4 provides the estimation results.

Using a drop in the size number of fiscal transfers following fiscal reform in the early 2000 s, this study examines the extent to which unconditional fiscal transfers to municipalities in the Tokyo metropolitan area are attributed to land prices. The result shows that the decline in the transfer has decreased the land prices in the municipalities. Furthermore, reducing one unit in the per capita grant reduced the value of housing area per capita by one or more units, even if the real discount rate was assumed to be as low as 2%. Therefore, the fiscal transfer reform more negatively affects the benefits of residing in a municipality in the area than the reduction amount in the transfer.","Intergovernmental fiscal transfers from the central to local governments serve as a major source of revenue for local governments in many countries (Boadway and Shah, 2007). The main purpose of intergovernmental fiscal transfers is to shrink the fiscal capacity gap between regions and guarantee financial resources for all regions to provide a minimum level of public services. Theoretically, such fiscal transfers can also serve as a means of resolving inefficiencies in the level of taxes and public services in each region caused by interregional shifts of population and tax bases (see, e.g., Boadway and Flatters, 1982; Köthenbürger, 2002; Boadway, 2004). In particular, lump-sum transfers are classically argued to be the most desirable form of fiscal transfer because they do not distort the behavior of local governments. However, some studies have highlighted several mechanisms that can lead to inefficiencies in resource allocation, even with lump-sum transfers.====The first is the inefficiency caused by the formula for fiscal transfer amount. When the calculation of fiscal transfer amount is based on fiscal or economic variables, local governments may have incentives to manipulate these variables to obtain more transfers. The resulting changes in local governments’ spending and revenue behavior can distort the efficiency of resource allocation (see, e.g., Knight, 2002; Leduc and Wilson, 2017; Lundqvist et al., 2014).====The second mechanism is the “soft budget” problem, in which local governments engage in profligate budgeting in anticipation of future bailouts by the central government.==== Suppose the central government is expected to bail them out using the existing fiscal transfer framework in a fiscal downturn. In that case, local governments will have no incentive to manage their financial conditions soundly, creating ex-ante moral hazard. Even if the fiscal transfer amount is determined using a specific formula, the central government could conceivably change that formula to provide relief to a specific local government. This soft budget problem is another factor that can distort the resource allocation efficiency (e.g., Pettersson-Lidbom, 2010). Moreover, Akai et al. (2003) discussed the possibility of the national government using a local allocation tax (LAT) grant, which is the fiscal transfer that this study focuses on, to bail out local governments.====The third is the inefficiency associated with rent-seeking by politicians and bureaucrats. If municipality residents are not well informed about the subsidy amount transferred to the municipality, local politicians and bureaucrats may use subsidies to enhance their benefits. Existing studies have found links between fiscal transfers and corruption and rent-seeking (e.g., Fisman and Gatti, 2002) and political contributions from the public work sector to the fiscal transfer amount (e.g., Leduc and Wilson, 2017).====Generally, subsidies from the national government to local governments lead to higher levels of public services and lower tax burdens in local governments, and thus, the benefits of residing in such local governments are expected to increase. However, the aforementioned inefficiencies do not necessarily mean that the benefits of living in the municipality will increase sufficiently. Moreover, the expansion of public services and investment in social capital may attract private sector investment, resulting in a fiscal multiplier effect that will increase residential benefits beyond the fiscal transfer amount.==== Therefore, to what extent the newly allocated fiscal transfers to local governments are used efficiently is unclear, and this issue must be examined empirically.====This paper analyzes the effect of changes in fiscal transfer amount from the national to local governments on residential benefits, based on the capitalization hypothesis that public services and taxes are attributed to housing and land prices. The extent to which fiscal transfers to municipalities in Japan are attributed to land prices will be examined using the decline in the fiscal transfer amount in the early 2000 s fiscal reform.====The reform reduced the amount of LAT grant, an unrestricted fiscal transfer from the national government to local governments, and significantly reduced the size amount to small municipalities. A decline in fiscal transfers will reduce the level of public services in the municipality and increase the tax burden on residents, thus reducing the benefits of living in the municipality. Consequently, housing and land prices are expected to decline. By analyzing the size of the decline in housing and land prices, the study will shed light on the extent to which fiscal transfers are used to enhance the benefits of living in the region.====The analysis will focus on municipalities in the Tokyo metropolitan area. This region is relatively densely populated; therefore, the housing and land markets are considered well-functioning. Besides, the area is relatively independent of the influence of municipal mergers, as the area did not undergo large-scale municipal mergers in the 2000 s====The analysis reveals that the decrease in the LAT grant has lowered the land prices in the municipalities, although a slight lag exists before its realization. Hence, the fiscal transfer from the national government to municipalities in the form of a LAT grant is used to enhance the benefits to residents. Furthermore, a decrease of one unit in the per capita grant reduced the housing area per capita value by one or more units, despite the assumption that real discount rate is as low as 2%. Given this result, the LAT grant allocated to municipalities raises the willingness-to-pay amount for a residency by approximately the same or greater amount. This suggests a more negative effect of the fiscal transfer reform on the benefits of residing in a municipality in the area than on the amount of reduction. Although the government conducted this reform to improve local governments’ fiscal efficiency, the result may have been a reduction in the fiscal transfer which is highly effective in increasing residential benefits for local governments.====Likewise, a few studies have analyzed the extent to which fiscal transfers to local governments affect residential housing prices. The seminal paper by Hilber et al. (2011) used UK housing price data to analyze the extent to which the central government’s fiscal transfers to local governments capitalize into house prices, using political fluctuations in the amount of intergovernmental fiscal transfers caused by whether each region supports the national ruling party as an instrumental variable. Their results show that such windfall grants are roughly fully capitalized into house prices and that the degree of capitalization is greater in regions with inelastic housing supply. Using the institutional change of fiscal transfer allocation in the Netherlands, Allers and Vermeulen (2016) also analyzed the degree of capitalization of grants into house prices. Similar to Hilber et al. (2011), Allers and Vermeulen (2016) observed almost full capitalization of intergovernmental fiscal transfers into house prices. Meanwhile, although in a slightly different line of research, following Brueckner (1982), Barrow and Rouse (2004) analyzed the effects of fiscal transfers from state governments to school districts in the United States on housing prices. They used a grant variation from fiscal transfer system reform, implemented in many states from 1970 to the 1990 s to strengthen revenue equalization among school districts. They concluded that fiscal transfer is effectively used because the Samuelson condition is satisfied, and full capitalization has occurred. Thus, existing research reveals that windfall-type grants from central to subnational governments would almost fully capitalize on house prices.====The present study is the first to provide causal evidence of capitalization of intergovernmental fiscal transfers in Japan and the degree of capitalization. Previous Japanese studies focused on the capitalization effect and did not estimate the causal relationship between LAT grants and land prices. Only a few studies have discussed their relationship. For example, extending the argument of Brueckner (1982), Kondo (2008) investigated the role of fiscal transfers regarding the efficiency of social capital based on the capitalization hypothesis.==== Kondo (2008) concludes that the fiscal transfers, including LAT grants, induce the allocational inefficiency of social capital. Kondo (2016) also analyzed the relationship between social capital and land prices, including fiscal transfers, taking LAT grants as explanatory variables, though the fiscal transfer variables were not of primary interest. The estimated coefficient of the LAT is negative and statistically insignificant. The result is inconsistent with that of this paper, probably because Kondo (2016) has not addressed the endogeneity problem of the LAT.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides institutional background on the LAT grant and details of the reform exploited to identify the effect and then describes the data used. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents and interprets the estimation results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.","Capitalization of local government grants on land values: Evidence from Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142521000517,8 November 2021,2021,Research Article,36.0

It is well known that growing intra-regional trade in East Asia along global value chains (GVCs) and production networks have been driven by foreign multinational enterprises. There have been a large number of empirical studies that investigated GVCs and regional production networks using a firm-level data (see, for recent research, Chun et al., 2021; Ito et al. 2021).==== Baldwin and Okubo (2019) developed the “GVC journey diagram” to illustrate the evolution of GVC situation in various countries.====The degree of economic integration also needs to be empirically assessed from macroeconomic point of view, especially in the context of East Asia. For instance, East Asia differs from Europe in the lack of regional political cooperation and institutional arrangements. Indeed, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) was established in 2015, and this has been considered a key milestone for regional economic integration. The ASEAN countries have promoted regional economic growth and development by signing free trade agreements and/or economic partnership agreements with China, Japan and Korea. However, the AEC is a loosely organized economic community, unlike the European economic and monetary union that can be considered de jure integration. Thus, the East Asian region lags far behind the European Union or the Eurozone because of lack of regional political cooperation and institutional arrangements.====To evaluate the progress and viability of regional integration in East Asia from a macroeconomic perspective, previous studies analyzed the degree of real output co-movements and/or symmetry of fundamental economic shocks among candidate countries, mainly using a vector-autoregressive (VAR) model. Sato et al. (2011) and Dungey and Vehbi (2015) used the structural VAR technique to assess which type of shock (i.e., global or regional) has larger influence on regional economies in East Asia. Lee and Azali (2012) and Hirata et al. (2013) applied a dynamic factor model to the question of regional economic integration in East Asia. Huh and Park, 2018, Huh and Park, 2019 proposed a composite index, the Asia/Pacific Regional Integration Index (APRII), to measure the degree of regional integration constructed by the principal component analysis with various macroeconomic variables and indicated that Asia is much less integrated than the European Union. These studies, however, tend to conduct a single-country estimation one by one and fail to capture multilateral relation for economic integration.====In contrast to the previous research, this paper employs the generalized purchasing power parity (G-PPP) model that was originally developed by Enders and Hurn (1994) and modified by Kawasaki and Ogawa (2006) and Kawasaki (2012). A major advantage of the G-PPP model over the VAR approach is to detect the presence of a multilateral long-run relationship among countries or within some geographical areas. In other words, we can detect some economic linkages across countries that imply not only historic, geographic or political reasons but also a consequence of real economic activities that share common productivity growth through supply chains across countries. Among the VAR approaches, one exception is a global VAR model that can consider a multilateral long-run relationship and evaluate global inter-linkages between domestic and foreign variables. Dees et al. (2007), Pesaran et al. (2007), Fielding et al. (2012), and Ong and Sato (2018) used a global VAR model to empirically evaluate economic and monetary integration in East Asia. We, however, develop the G-PPP model to a ==== analysis by employing a momentum threshold autoregressive (M-TAR) model to allow for possible non-linearity arising from dynamic nature of regional economic growth and development. A non-linear estimation method is especially relevant in the context of East Asia because regional countries have experienced not only rapid economic growth and development but also severe economic turmoil arising from external shocks such as the global financial crisis.====Another contribution of our paper is to use the industry-specific real effective exchange rates (I-REERs) to extend the G-PPP analysis to an industry-level analysis. Previous studies in the literature of the G-PPP model, such as Mishra and Sharma (2010) and Rangkakulnuwat et al. (2010), typically employ aggregated macroeconomic variables at a country level and fail to consider possible differences in the scope and degree of economic integration across industries. An industry-level analysis of economic linkages is particularly important in investigating regional integration in East Asia. As discussed in the GVC literature, the degree and scope of production linkages are likely to differ across industries and are conditional on whether a country is located upstream or downstream along the production chain.==== Previous studies that used the G-PPP model for a country-level analysis failed to capture industry-specific production linkages developed in East Asia.====Our industry-level analysis is based on the two-digit level of the International Standard Industrial Classification Revision 3 (ISIC.R3), since we use the industry-specific real effective exchange rates (I-REERs) developed by Sato et al., 2013, Sato et al., 2020 that disaggregated the real effective exchange rate (REER) data into 13 industry-level REERs. Empirical analysis at the two-digit ISIC level may be too aggregated from the viewpoint of the GVC literature. However, to our knowledge, the present paper is the first study that conducts an industry-level G-PPP analysis. Whereas more aggregated data may be necessary, we attempt to provide important insight into possible differences in the scope and degree of regional integration in East Asia.====The empirical results suggest that economic integration has progressed widely in East Asia, but integration patterns differ across machinery industries. As for the general machinery industry, the scope of regional integration is limited compared to other machinery industries. Both Japan and Korea as well as both Taiwan and Indonesia are less likely to be integrated jointly with regional integration. Moreover, the Granger causality test reveals that regional economic linkages in the general machinery industry are ascribed not only to the regional economies but also to the outside economies. This implies less autonomous integration in the general machinery industry.====In contrast, economic integration has progressed more autonomously in the electrical industry and the transportation equipment industry. The automobile industry has grown not only in ASEAN countries centred on Thailand but also in China that has the largest market in the region, which has been promoted by foreign multinationals including Japanese and Korean firms. Growing regional production and supply chains in the automobile industry are likely to facilitate more autonomous regional integration that is less dependent on the external demand from the United States and European countries. As is often pointed out, export products in the electrical industry tend to be invoiced in US dollars and the final shipping destinations for finished products are the United States and Europe. However, our Granger causality test suggests that East Asian production becomes less affected by business cycles in the United States and Europe, and regional production and supply chains have developed and become more autonomous in the electrical industry.====By decomposing the electrical industry into three sub-sectors, however, we reveal that regional integration patterns differ markedly across these sub-sectors. Korea and Japan are less likely to be integrated in the communication equipment sector as well as the office machinery sector, which may reflect an uneven spread of regional integration. If regional integration progressed unevenly, it would be hard to make region-wide policy coordination in East Asia.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 elaborates the G-PPP model and explains how to use the industry-specific data of real effective exchange rates. Section 3 explains how to apply the M-TAR model to the unit root test. Section 4 presents the empirical results of the non-linear unit root test and the Granger causality test.

To analyze this issue, it is essential to have an evidence-based understanding of the situation regarding the effect of deductions on the tax burden reduction and income redistribution. To this end, we use household microdata from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure during 1994–2014 to conduct a quantitative evaluation of the burden reduction and redistribution effects of deductions over a 20-year period. Initially, the higher the income group, the higher the burden reduction effect of the deductions (ratio of deductions to gross income). However, the advantageous treatment of the higher income group has been decreasing annually and, recently, the burden reduction effect has reached a proportional structure. Although the system changes in deductions have decreased the tax burden effect due to deductions, these changes have contributed to weakening the effect of increasing the ====.","In Japan, the review of the household tax burden has started to be recently considered as essential for maintaining the social insurance system, and there is also a call to reexamine the income and resident taxes. As such, the status of the deduction system has also become an important policy issue, with observers noting that the generous tax deductions significantly eroded the tax base.====These points are discussed in the international research on tax expenditure. Tax expenditure is represented by specific tax rules in the form of deductions, exclusions, credits, and favorable rates, which benefit specific activities, industries, or taxpayer groups (Burman et al., 2017, p. 109), which is why the burden reduction due to tax expenditure has been considered in the literature (Burman et al., 2008, Burman et al., 2017, Poterba, 2011, Altshuler and Dietz, 2011, Albarea et al., 2015, Avram, 2018). By contrast, in Japan, the income and resident tax systems mainly make extensive use of deductions, with several academic initiatives measuring the scale of the deductions and the resulting tax base erosion degree (Morinobu and Maekawa, 2001, Tajika and Yashio, 2006a, Tajika and Yashio, 2006b, Tajika and Yashio, 2008, Tajika and Yashio, 2010, Uemura, 2008, Mochizuki et al., 2010, Kaneda, 2014, Morinobu and Nakamoto, 2013; Matsuda et al., 2014; Nakamoto, 2014; Yashio and Hachisuka, 2014; Uemura and Adachi, 2015; Ohno et al., 2020). Furthermore, attempts to measure the contribution of deductions in the research on tax redistribution effects have also been made (Mochizuki et al., 2010, Miyazaki and Kitamura, 2016, Kaneda, 2018, Doi, 2017, Miyazaki et al., 2019). However, the Japanese government’s Tax Commission has indicated that the status of the deduction system needs to be revised to restore the income redistribution function, given that the tax burden relief increases for higher income groups (Tax Commission, 2016, p. 6). As a result, the status of the deduction system has become an important policy issue for the tax system, with increasing discussions focusing on the burden reduction effect of deductions. Therefore, while there is increasing interest in the impact of the tax burden reduction through deductions and the associated impact on the redistribution effect, few studies quantitatively evaluate them. Further, there is little evidence to indicate (i) which taxpayer groups receive the greatest benefit from the tax burden reduction (i.e., the structure of the tax burden reduction effect) and (ii) how the tax burden reduction associated with deductions changes the effect of income disparity correction through tax (i.e., the impact on the redistribution effect). As such, there is no adequate analysis of the situation to enable discussions on the future of the deduction system.====In this study, we thus attempt to use household microdata (questionnaire based) from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (NSFIE, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014) to focus on Japan’s income and resident taxes over 20 years and quantitatively evaluate the tax burden reduction and redistribution effects of deductions.==== To this end, it is essential to consider what deductions are applied to each household in the tax system, which is why we conducted a microsimulation by applying the actual tax system to the household income and family composition recorded by the questionnaire to estimate the deduction and tax amounts. Subsequently, to comprehend the tax burden reduction effect due to deductions, we estimated the size of the difference in the tax amount from the application of deductions. Specifically, we used the method of Burman et al. (2017) to estimate the tax burden reduction amount due to deductions for each household as follows. First, we applied a tax estimation process that reflects the actual tax system to estimate the tax amount when deductions were applied (tax amount a). Second, we estimated the hypothetical tax amount when deductions were not applied (tax amount b). Since deductions reduce tax, tax amount b is always higher than tax amount a. Finally, the difference between the two tax amounts (= tax amount b – tax amount a) is considered as the amount of the tax burden reduction due to deductions.====Moreover, there have been several research attempts using individual household data on the redistribution effect of the Japanese tax system and social insurance system.==== One literature stream focuses on the redistribution effect in terms of the change in the income disparity due to the burdens and benefits of the tax and social insurance systems; however, the comparison of this redistribution effect between various points in time includes the impacts of not only the “system reform factors” associated with system changes, but also of the “non-system reform factors” associated with changes such as income distribution and demographic composition. To address this issue, we used a similar approach to that of Bargain and Callan (2010) and Bargain (2012) by separating the changes in the redistribution effect of the deductions into system and non-system reforms. By this approach, we consider “the impact on the redistribution effect of changes such as income distribution and demographic composition in the case where no system reform was made” (non-system reform factors), while also extracting the “true contribution to redistribution effect of system reforms themselves” (system reform factors).====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present the background of the changes to the income and resident tax systems since 1994. In Section 3, we explain the data and the estimation method for the income and resident tax amounts. In Section 4, we analyze the structure of the burden reduction effect of deductions and, in Section 5, we consider the impact of deductions on the redistribution effect. Finally, in Section 6, we draw conclusions and discuss the implications of the results.",Effects of deductions on the tax burden reduction and the redistribution of the income and resident taxes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142521000499,30 October 2021,2021,Research Article,38.0

The paper identifies five such periods, beginning with two bitter conflicts in 1971 and ending with an equally difficult conflict over autos in 1994−95. It presents econometric evidence suggesting rising Japanese penetration of the American market and growth in the bilateral merchandise trade deficit with Japan were important causes of these crises. Over 1996–2016, US-Japan relations were handled in a much less confrontational manner, as import penetration declined. The difficulties Japan’s economy faced; heightened security concerns in Northeast Asia; a broader US shift away from unilateral measures; greater acceptance of the trade deficit; and perceptions that Japan was moving to open its economy were also important in lessening tensions in the bilateral relationship. Strong concerns with the US trade deficit re-emerged under the Trump Administration, but the two economies were, during this period, able to address trade differences without a major confrontation.","The US trade relationship with Japan was a difficult one from the late 1960s until the mid-1990s. Although the two countries maintained close security ties, the relationship was characterised by periodic conflict which, on some occasions, brought them to the brink of trade war. The two ‘Nixon shocks’ and a bitter wrangle over textiles in 1971 provided an early indication of the problems the bilateral relationship was to face for the next quarter of a century. The 1971 crises were followed by others – in 1977−78, 1986−87, 1989−90 and 1994−95. There were many other trade disputes of lesser, but still very significant intensity over the whole period.====The trade relationship improved after 1995. Edward Lincoln noted the change in a detailed account of the US-Japan relationship, observing that trade issues since that date had ‘continued on the government agenda and sometimes erupted in public … but overall were relegated to a much lower level of priority and proceeded more quietly’ (1999, 1). In contrast to the earlier period, China emerged as the economy presenting the most difficult bilateral trade issues.====The present article starts by identifying periods of intense trade conflict over 1969−95. It then looks at the merits of explanations of US-Japan trade tensions. The paper argues that intense conflict was partly a consequence of Japan’s economic rise, which led it to capture an increasing share of the US import market and place a number of American industries under challenge. But growth in the bilateral trade deficit played an important role, adding fuel to simmering tensions on industry-specific issues already present. The fourth part of the paper takes up the relationship from 1996 to 2016, suggesting that the fall in Japan’s import penetration of the American market was a key factor in the decline in trade tensions. Section 5 outlines the economic and statistical model on which econometric work discussed in Section 6 is based.

The average growth rate declined to 4.9% in the 2000s and further to 3.3% in the 2010s. The volatility of growth has also declined since the 2000s, a trend that is commonly observed in advanced countries with economic development, such as during the “Great Moderation” of the 2000s in the U.S. (e.g., Blanchard and Simon, 2001, Stock and Watson, 2003). Although in the long run economic growth and stability can be determined by various structural factors, including population aging and development stages, the development path of Korea’s industrial structure can also play an important role.====In the last two decades, the Korean economy has experienced considerable structural changes in its industrial structure. The economy has become more concentrated in a few manufacturing industries, while its interconnectedness across industries has risen via vertical relationships. At the same time, the importance of international trade has increased with Korea’s growing participation in global value chains (GVCs). The rise in economic concentration and interconnectedness could become sources of macroeconomic instability as macroeconomic fluctuations are primarily the results of many microeconomic shocks at the sectoral or firm level (e.g., Gabaix, 2011, Carvalho and Gabaix, 2013, Foerster et al., 2011) and the presence of concentrated sectoral hubs can lead to aggregate fluctuations (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2012, Carvalho, 2010).==== Moreover, macroeconomic tail risks can be created from the propagation of microeconomic shocks through the input–output network (Acemoglu et al., 2017). In this respect, the recent decline in gross domestic product (GDP) volatility does not necessarily secure economic stability in the future.====The World Input–Output Database (WIOD) can provide a country’s input–output relationships within the country as well as across country borders. It exhibits that the Korean industry has been highly interconnected with other industries through domestic input–output relationships. The overall domestic vertical linkages (the share of intermediate input in the total output) increased to 47.1% in 2009 from 44.3% in 2000, but remained stable afterwards. In addition, the Korean economy has become more interconnected to the global economy through trade relationships in the last two decades, with a sharp rise of export and import linkages in manufacturing since the 2000s. The growing number of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) has been signed over the 2000s with many countries—including Korea’s important trading partners, such as the U.S., China, EU and many others—may have played a role in increasing Korea’s interconnectedness to the global economy (Russ and Swenson, 2019, Yi, 2020).====Looking at trade linkages by trading partners, export and import linkages to China rose drastically in major manufacturing industries throughout the 2000s. The substantial increase in trade linkages to China over the 2000s may relate to the growing emergence of China’s presence in the global economy, especially after China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. On the other hand, trade linkages to the U.S. and Japan declined noticeably in major manufacturing industries during the same period.====This paper examines the role of vertical and trade linkages in the propagation of economic shocks originated from both domestic sources (domestic productivity shocks) and external sources (external trade shocks). The empirical analysis uses the industry-level international input–output data from the WIOD. The empirical model extends the model of Acemoglu et al. (2016a) to be more applicable to the Korean economy.====The empirical analysis establishes the following findings. First, domestic productivity shocks have larger downstream effects (due to supplier shocks) than upstream effects (due to customer shocks). This finding implies that industries (or firms) are more likely to be affected by the seller’s productivity shocks than by the buyer’s productivity shocks, which is consistent with the existing studies’ theoretical predictions and empirical findings (Acemoglu et al., 2016a, Carvalho and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2019).==== Second, external trade shocks are propagated to the Korean industry mainly through its direct import linkages to the country. That is, industries that are highly involved in direct import transactions with foreign countries are significantly affected by external trade shocks. Third, the separate estimation for manufacturing industries demonstrates that the transmission of domestic productivity shocks via downstream linkages and the propagation of external trade shocks via direct import linkages are significant for manufacturing industries as well as for the total industry. Our empirical findings on the propagation of economic shocks through vertical and trade linkages for the Korean economy are largely consistent with the main results of previous studies for other advanced countries: e.g., the U.S. (Acemoglu et al., 2016a), Japan (Carvalho et al., 2021, Fujii, 2016), and France (di Giovanni et al., 2017).====In addition, the average productivity impacts from domestic shocks and external shocks are estimated to be quantitatively sizable. For domestic shocks, productivity shocks in chemicals are estimated to have large productivity impacts mainly due to the industry’s high vertical linkages to other industries, while productivity shocks in electronics and transportation are also expected to have considerable productivity impacts. For external trade shocks, China trade shocks would have the largest productivity impacts as the Korean economy is most highly linked to China via trade linkages, while the trade shocks from the U.S. and Japan would have smaller but non-negligible productivity impacts. The results highlight that economic shocks in key manufacturing industries and/or major trading partners can lead to large swings in the overall economy caused by the propagation of domestic and external disturbances through vertical and trade linkages.====This paper is structured as follows. The next section reviews the related literature and discusses the main contributions of this paper. Section 3 describes the data and some relevant stylized facts. Section 4 explores the implications of structural changes in the industrial structure for economic growth and stability. We empirically examine the role of vertical and trade linkages, through which the economic shocks can be propagated, in determining the productivity growth of Korean industries.

Hay Chanthol,"National University of Battambang, Cambodia","Received 10 November 2020, Revised 27 September 2021, Accepted 29 September 2021, Available online 6 October 2021, Version of Record 19 October 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japwor.2021.101102,Cited by (0),"This paper aims to identify real dollarization in markets in Phnom Penh and to investigate how U.S. dollar (USD) and Cambodian riel or Khmer riel (KHR) perform the three functions of money—a unit of account, a store of value and a medium of exchange in markets in Phnom Penh through two simple surveys. Real dollarization refers to the use of the U.S. dollar for purchasing goods and services and for paying salary. We find that the choice of currency for transactions varies with market types, sources of products whether they are imported or domestically produced, and prices of products. The survey about currency for salary payment shows that the majority of employed persons in the private sector and in non-government organization receive salary in U.S. dollar while those who work in public sector receive salary in Khmer riel. The majority of employed persons save their money in U.S. dollar. In general, U.S. dollar dominates Khmer riel in performing the three functions of money in Phnom Penh.","Although there are several dollarized countries in the world, Cambodia has a unique dollarization feature with a coexistence of the U.S. dollar and the local currency for local transactions, salary payments, and savings. In a two-currency economic system, it is natural that one currency will eventually dominate the other despite their initial coexistence. For Cambodia, the U.S. dollar and the local currency have coexisted for a long time. Unraveling the underlying reasons is the key motivation of this study. The main objective of this research was to explore the three functions of money for USD and for KHR in the capital city of Phnom Penh.====Dollarization is defined as the use in a given country of multiple currencies as media of exchange (this also means currency substitution). The term dollarization is also frequently used to indicate that foreign currency serves as a unit of account or as a store of value, and not necessarily as a medium of exchange (Calvo and Vegh, 1992). Financial dollarization occurs when the banking systems built nontrivial assets and liabilities positions denominated in dollars, mainly occurred in many emerging market economies routinely in early 1990s (Catão Luis and Terrones Marco, 2016). Real dollarization is the extent to which prices and wages are determined in foreign currency (Ize and Yeyati, 2003). This research focuses on this real dollarization. Dollarization is a type of hard peg. Most countries in Asia have their currencies pegged to U.S. dollar. Although the East Asian economies are geographically close to Japan, their currencies have been tied more closely to the U.S. dollar (Fukuda and Kano, 1997). Invoice currency from export of Asian countries was also largely denominated in U.S. dollar (Fukuda and Ono, 2006). For exports of Japan to Asia, the U.S. dollar, which is the currency of the third country, is commonly used (Ito and Kawai, 2016). Asia-Oceania countries belonged mainly to the U.S. dollar zone, leading to a high degree of U.S. dollar use for invoicing international trade (Ito et al., 2016). From our survey, most prices of the imported goods in Phnom Penh markets were also quoted in U.S. dollar.====Dollarization can have positive effects on economic growth through at least three channels-interest rate channel, currency risk channel and trade channel. Dollarized economy tends to have lower interest rates and higher investment. Thus economic growth will be higher. In addition, by eliminating currency risk through dollarization, higher investment and faster growth can be achieved (Dornbusch, 2001). National currency can be a barrier to trade. Thus, trade can be improved by reducing this barrier through dollarization (Rose and Eric, 2001). Another benefit of dollarization is the increase in economic horizon because stable and low inflation and stable currency can be achieved under dollarization. However, empirical studies about the economic benefits of dollarization on macroeconomic variables showed mixed results. Some studies show negative impacts of dollarization. Countries that use a convertible currency as legal tender are called strictly dollarized countries. GDP per capita growth has not been statistically different in dollarized and in non-dollarized countries. Dollarized countries have had a slightly lower rate of growth than countries with a domestic currency; this difference, however, is not statistically significant. Volatility has been significantly higher in dollarized than in non-dollarized economies (Edwards and Magendzo, 2006). Using panel data, deposit dollarization has a negative but small impact on the real interest rate (Bacha et al., 2009).====The process through which a strong currency penetrates into an economy of weak currency is of great interest. The following description about dollarization, which is borrowed from Végh (2013), reflects the current situation in Cambodian economy. ====For ease of demonstration, the word “USD” means the U.S. dollar and KHR or riel refers Cambodian currency. This paper uses two surveys to explain the reasons why people use local currency and how prices are quoted in Market in Phnom Penh. Understanding about price denomination is important to understand about the sensitive of exchange rate to inflation. When asking how much, some sellers told the prices of their products in USD and some sellers tell the prices in local currency KHR, but both currencies are accepted. Some sellers quoted prices of their products in KHR while some others in USD. Similarly, some buyers paid in USD while some others in KHR. When there is mismatch between currency that sellers want and currency that buyers pay, both buyers and sellers together set an exchange rate at the point of purchasing goods or services.====Several studies about dollarization in Cambodia focused on financial dollarization by using foreign currency deposit as a main indicator, in particular, to measure elasticity of currency substitution, to investigate the effect of currency depreciation on an economic variable or to measure the seigniorage loss. There have been not many research articles that use survey data to analyze real dollarization in Cambodia. This research aims to fill this gap by conducting a survey at point of sale to analyze real dollarization in markets in Phnom Penh and the other survey about dollarization in salary payment for employed and self-employed persons in Phnom Penh. Ra (2008) found that, for the time period 1992–2007, there were positive effects (expected) of the expected rate of depreciation in market exchange rates on the holdings of U.S. dollars. The effect is strongest for Cambodia, and this may reflect the fact that Cambodia’s dollarization is stronger than those of Laos and Vietnam. Cambodia seems to have stronger tendency towards currency substitution compared with Lao and Vietnam. This mainly because foreign currency holding in Cambodia have never been prohibited during the period under study. Jayant (2008) argued that the recent increase in dollarization seems to be good news because it is a result of increasing FDI, which reflects an increase in confidence in the economy, rising exports. The recent dollarization is transaction-based. In the past, dollarization in Cambodia was the direct legacy of the destruction of economic and financial institutions after the 1970s, economic mismanagement in the 1980s, and the large inflows of U.S. dollars that occurred during the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) period in the early 1990s. Institutional constraints that prevent the use the riel include the preference given to U.S. dollars in the payment of wages to non-public sector workers. The fact that the Labor Law continues to define the minimum wage in U.S. dollars exemplifies this preference. Kang (2005) discussed the costs and benefits of dollarization in Cambodia and he estimated the seigniorage loss reached up to 681.8 million USD at the end of 2004 due to the amount of stock of dollars in the economy. In addition to this, annual extra seigniorage of about 60 million USD per year was lost due to loss of ability to create more Cambodia’s riels and interest loss. Samreth (2010) using monthly data from 1998:07 to 2005:12 to estimate elasticity of substitution between foreign and real currency balances in Cambodia and found the elasticity was high. (Samreth et al., 2019) found that, based on a vector autoregression estimation of quarterly data over 1994Q4–2016Q4, a positive U.S. interest rate shock has a negative impact on Cambodia’s trade balance with the European Union as the shock leads to appreciation of the U.S. dollar. In addition, dollarization of bank deposits can lead to higher risks of financial instability than non-dollarized economies (De Nicoló et al., 2005).====There were surveys in which households and firms in Cambodia were interviewed about dollarization. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) jointly conducted two main surveys about dollarization in Cambodia: enterprise survey and household survey. In the NBC–JICA enterprise survey which was conducted from October 2014 to January 2015, 856 managers of enterprises (182 samples from Phnom Penh) were interviewed about dollarization. Using this NBC–JICA enterprise survey, Aiba and Tha (2017) found that loans, revenues, expenditures and price quotations were highly dollarized and that the degree of dollarization varied across regions, firm sizes and industries. They also found that, using the enterprise survey data, there was a currency mismatch between the currency compositions of revenues and expenditures. Odajima et al. (2019) recommended that policy measures for enterprises to facilitate the pricing currency to shift from foreign currency to the local currency might in turn motivate household to use the local currency. As for households, the currency for wages or salary needs to be guided towards the local currency denomination. Unlike this NBC–JICA enterprise survey, our first survey interviewed sellers with a total sample of 835 at point of sale at retail market level in Phnom Penh. Our first survey can better capture the usage of the U.S. dollar for transactions of goods and services at point of sale by market and product category in Phnom Penh than the JICA–NBC enterprise survey which interviewed managers of enterprises. Using data from our first survey, we found that the decision to quote price in U.S. dollar depended largely on price level, market type, product category and the source of the products. On the other hand, In the NBC–JICA household survey which was conducted from October 2014 to January 2015, 2273 households nationwide, of which 150 household from Phnom Penh, were interviewed about foreign/local currency usage from various angles such as income, expenditures, savings, and borrowings (Odajima and Khou, 2017). Aiba et al. (2018) investigated the determinants of foreign currency borrowing of households in Cambodia. It was found that Cambodian households engaged in risk-hedging behavior against exchange rate risks in the sense that their likelihoods of borrowing in foreign currency increase as the share of foreign currency in their incomes increases. From the NBC–JICA household survey data, it was found that foreign currency has a very minor role in total expenditure while the local currency plays the major role in expenditure (Odajima and AIBA, 2019). Odajima and AIBA (2019) suggested that reducing the transaction costs of local currency relative to foreign currency by promoting banking services in the local currency, introducing large value KHR banknotes or promoting digitized payments with preferential treatment in KHR can have a positive impact on household use of the local currency in domestic transactions. Unlike the NBC–JICA household survey, our second survey collected 582 samples of employed persons and self-employed in Phnom Penh to mainly analyze the determinants of currency choice for salary payment and saving. In addition, we also explored how the U.S. dollar flowed from Phnom Penh to other rural areas where Cambodian riel currently played a dominant role by interviewing garment workers in Phnom Penh. We found that the currency choice for salary payment and saving depended on education level, age, institution and wage level. For savings, USD is preferred to KHR. We found that 89.6% of those who earned income or salary in USD saved their money in USD and 69% of those who earned income or salary in KHR saved their money in KHR. The flow of USD from Phnom Penh to rural areas did not occur much through trade of agriculture products from rural areas but it did through remittance of garment workers to their households in rural areas. Our topic is critically different from the existing studies which focus on dollarization at firm level and household level because we focused only on real dollarization at point of sale and in salary payment. The uniqueness of this paper is that we conducted our own surveys to interview sellers at point of sale in different markets in Phnom Penh and employed and self-employed persons about real dollarization.====Section 2 describes some personal experiences of dollarization in Phnom Penh. Section 3 describes our research methodology. Section 4 provides historical backgrounds of Phnom Penh and its economic development.

To this end, this study estimates the local fiscal multipliers in Japan. Results suggest that the estimated local fiscal multiplier on output is larger in non-aged areas than aged areas, and that the effects on the number of workers are not statistically significant in either area type. Additionally, the multipliers on private investment are only higher than one in non-aged prefectures. Results also indicate that the multiplier generated by an increase in government investment is larger than that in government consumption. These results indicate fewer slack resources in aged areas that can be mobilized in response to increased government spending.","This study investigates how the effectiveness of fiscal policy depends on population aging. As many countries, especially advanced economies, are facing population aging, and behaviors of the economy may well depend on the age structure,==== several studies examined how population aging impacts fiscal multipliers (Basso and Rachedi, 2021; Yoshino and Miyamoto, 2017; Miyamoto and Yoshino, 2020, Miyamoto and Yoshino, 2021; Honda and Miyamoto, 2021). They imply that the effectiveness of fiscal policies could be weakened by population aging. This study expands this literature by estimating the local fiscal multiplier in Japan, which possesses both a sufficiently large economic and population structure disparities across regions and high elderly ratio, as is shown in Fig. 1. The elderly ratios of Japanese prefectures are all less than 14 % in 1975, and they all become larger than 21 % in 2018.====Although time series data are often used to quantify the fiscal multiplier (Ramey, 2011), time series data would not necessarily be suited to examine the effects of population aging on the fiscal multiplier because population aging proceeds much more slowly than the business cycle. This study analyzes panel data—a more promising approach because it can utilize both the cross-sectional difference in population aging and time series changes. Honda and Miyamoto (2021) and Miyamoto and Yoshino (2021) used international panel data, but it might be restrictive to analyze the pooled data from different countries with different economic structures. Therefore, this study used regional panel data in a single country and estimated the local fiscal multiplier, as in Basso and Rachedi (2021).====The past decade has witnessed a wave of new research on local fiscal multipliers. Although the local fiscal multiplier does not correspond directly to the national fiscal multiplier, this approach has several advantages (Chodorow-Reich, 2019). First, this approach utilizes variations of a policy across time and regions that are more plausibly exogenous. Second, this approach typically controls time fixed effects, which absorb variations at the national level including business cycles, monetary policies, and national fiscal variables. The geographical differences in government spending following the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) are often used in studies in the US (Chodorow-Reich et al., 2012; Wilson, 2012; Conley and Dupor, 2013; Dupor and Mehkari 2016; Dupor and McCrory, 2018).==== Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) and Dupor and Guerrero (2017) have examined US data on military spending, which can be seen as exogenous to the regional economic situation. Others have explored the disparity between US states in terms of fiscal rules (Clemens and Miran, 2012), investment returns earned by public pension plans (Shoag, 2013), and the revision of population counts (Serrato and Wingender, 2016).====Outside the US, Acconcia et al. (2014) have used instances of local public spending contractions in Italian provinces as a result of Mafia infiltration. Guo et al. (2016) estimated the local fiscal multiplier in China using the national government’s designation of National Poor Counties. Meanwhile, based on a comprehensive review of extant studies, Chodorow-Reich (2019) identified a cross-study mean of about 1.8. Using annual data from 47 prefectures in Japan during the 1990s, Brukner and Tuladhar (2014) obtained statistically significant and positive estimates, although no larger than 1. However, Kameda et al.’s (2021) results suggest that the value of the multiplier is 1.6.====This study contributes to the literature by empirically demonstrating the heterogeneity of local fiscal multipliers due to population aging among Japanese regions, based on an instrumental variable method employed in the literature. As noted, recent studies on local fiscal multipliers often employ natural experimental situations, which is not applicable to the Japanese context. Therefore Brukner and Tuladhar (2014) used a system-GMM estimation, and Kameda et al. (2021) focused on intergovernmental transfers from the central government that were not correlated with local economic shocks. Considering the “integrated” nature of Japanese fiscal federalism (Muramatsu et al., 2001; Bessho, 2016), there is room for disagreement regarding their exogeneity assumptions. This study constructs instruments motivated by Bartik (1991), which are used in the literature (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014; Dupor and Guerrero, 2017; Nekarda and Ramey, 2011). This study also examines the effects on jobs (the number of workers), which is often investigated in the US literature but not that of Japan, and the effects on each component of output.====The results of this study can be summarized as follows. First, this study estimates a one-year local fiscal multiplier around or slightly larger than one, although it cannot detect statistically significant effects of government spending on the number of workers. Second, this study estimates the local fiscal multiplier to be larger in non-aged areas than aged areas. Third, results show that an increase in government spending increases private investment more than private consumption. This study did not find statistically significant effects on private consumption in either the aged or non-aged prefectures, while the multipliers on private investment are estimated to be more than one only in non-aged prefectures. Fourth, results show that the multiplier generated by an increase in government investment is larger than that in government consumption.====These results may indicate that there are fewer less slack resources in aged areas that can be mobilized in response to an increase in government spending if the population aging is associated with a decrease in the ratio of those who are able and willing to work, as emphasized in the literature. Another possible hypothesis is that population aging could be associated with concerns about future tax burdens and reduce potential economic growth and returns for investment, which in turn depress crowding-in effects on private investment.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the framework of this study’s econometric specification. Section 3 explains the data used in the regression analysis. Section 4 presents the results without considering population aging, while Section 5 presents the heterogeneities due to population aging. Section 6 provides the results of robustness checks.

We use firm-patent-matched data for Japanese manufacturing MNEs, including data on MNEs’ offshore R&D expenditure and information on patents filed by both parent firms and overseas affiliates. Moreover, as a proxy for the intensity of knowledge flows, we use the eigenvector centrality of each country-industry pair in the global knowledge flow network, utilizing patent citation information.====We find that the quality-adjusted number of patent applications tends to be higher for MNEs that allocate more R&D activities to country-industry pairs that are more central in the network of global knowledge flows. However, we did not find any significant relationship between the country and industry distribution of offshore R&D and the number of patent applications.","Over the past few decades, production processes have become increasingly fragmented and dispersed across borders, and multinational enterprises (MNEs), including Japanese MNEs, have played an important role in the expansion and deepening of the international division of labor. MNEs unbundle production processes and relocate them to offshore locations taking the comparative advantages of each location into account, and such MNEs show much better performance than domestic firms in terms of their size, productivity, profitability, and managerial and human resources. Although MNEs tend to retain research and development (R&D) activities close to their headquarters, a growing number of MNEs have offshored R&D activities to foreign locations (see, e.g., UNCTAD, 2005; OECD, 2010; Belderbos et al., 2016; Iversen et al., 2017).====Offshore R&D activities are expected to contribute to technological development to support local production and product development tailored to the local market (home-base-exploiting R&D). Offshore R&D activities may also promote development of new technologies by utilizing researchers, research institutes, and various other science and technology-related resources abroad (home-base-augmenting R&D).==== Given these potential benefits of R&D offshoring, previous studies have investigated the determinants and effects of offshore R&D, examining, for example, (1) what firm and location characteristics are important as determinants of offshore R&D and whether the determinants differ depending on the type/purpose of offshore R&D; (2) whether offshore R&D contributes to firms’ technological development measured by patents or productivity; and (3) what firm and location characteristics are associated with successful offshore R&D.====Regarding the determinants of offshore R&D, Shimizutani and Todo (2008); Ito and Wakasugi (2007), and Belderbos et al. (2016), for example, show that the technological capabilities of host regions/countries are an important factor, particularly for home-base-augmenting offshore R&D. As for the effects of R&D offshoring, Todo and Shimizutani (2008) and Castellani and Pieri (2013) show that R&D offshoring is likely to improve productivity at home, while other studies find that firms with active R&D offshoring tend to file for more patents (e.g., Almeida and Phene, 2004; Iwasa and Odagiri, 2004; Rahko, 2016; Belderbos et al., 2016; Yamashita and Yamauchi, 2019). Furthermore, studies such as Almeida and Phene (2004) and Iwasa and Odagiri (2004) take technological characteristics (the former focus on technological diversity while the latter focus on technological strength) of host regions/countries into account and find that MNEs tend to be more innovative in host regions/countries with higher technological capabilities, suggesting that offshoring firms take advantage of R&D resources in host regions/countries. Offshoring firms are not only able to directly employ local researchers but also learn from other technologically advanced firms, local science communities, and so on. In other words, firms are more likely to receive knowledge spillovers by offshoring in such places.====In fact, a large number of studies have found a positive relationship between R&D offshoring and innovation, suggesting that offshoring is likely to allow innovating firms to tap into the technological capabilities of host countries and improve their competitive advantage. However, the literature has devoted scant attention to the impact of R&D allocation across overseas affiliates within MNEs on their innovation performance.==== As highlighted by Shimizutani and Todo (2008) and Belderbos et al. (2016), MNEs do allocate different types of R&D activities (which are usually divided into two types: development and design on the one hand and basic/applied research on the other) to affiliates in different host countries based on host country characteristics.====Therefore, our particular question in this paper is to what extent the regional distribution of offshore R&D affects MNEs’ innovation performance. More specifically, we examine whether allocating more R&D activities to a country-industry pair with a higher intensity of knowledge flows improves the innovation performance of the MNE as a whole. As mentioned, firms are likely to receive more knowledge spillovers in places with abundant R&D resources. We expect that MNEs allocating more R&D activities to places where they receive more knowledge spillovers are more likely to develop/upgrade their own technological capabilities and become more innovative.====This study is novel in at least two respects. First, we focus on the allocation of offshore R&D across host countries and industries within MNEs. Among existing studies, the one that probably comes closest to the question we are interested in is a recent study by Yamashita and Yamauchi (2019), who, focusing on Japanese manufacturing MNEs, examine the effect of offshore R&D on patenting at home, grouping offshore R&D into that in developed and in developing host countries. Using Japanese Patent Office (JPO) data, they find that offshore R&D in developed host countries increases the quality of patents but does not have any impact on the number of patents. Although Yamashita and Yamauchi’s (2019) results suggest that where MNEs locate innovative activities is potentially an important determinant of innovation, and especially high-quality innovation, they do not examine the allocation of offshore R&D across developed and developing host countries within MNEs.====Second, we measure the relative position within the global knowledge flow network for each country-industry pair in the world and use the measure as a proxy for the knowledge flow intensity. As knowledge flows occur when an idea generated by somebody is absorbed by others, places closer to the center of a knowledge flow network are more likely to accumulate various kinds of knowledge learned from others in the network and generate more advanced knowledge which others want to learn. Moreover, this study uses international knowledge flows, not intra-country knowledge flows, because knowledge flows across countries are expected to be of higher quality and more advanced. In addition, we focus on innovation activities by MNEs and expect that MNEs want to learn and incorporate world-class technology. Therefore, we use international patent citations as a proxy for knowledge flows across countries and industries and construct measures for the network of global knowledge flows.==== Previous studies that take the knowledge stock of neighboring industries, regions, and/or countries into account often use the weighted average of the knowledge stock in a particular industry, region, and/or country using the technological or geographical distance or size of trade flows as weights.==== However, we try to measure the knowledge flows across countries and industries more directly by using patent citation information, not using geographical distance or trade flows. We employ the eigenvector centrality of the network of international and inter-industry knowledge flows, which reflects the influence of country-industry pairs in the network. The centrality measure reflects not only the size of the cumulative knowledge stock in each country-industry pair but also how strongly a country-industry pair is connected to other country-industry pairs in the network of global knowledge flows.==== As we discuss in more detail later in Section 4.1, our centrality measure is in fact highly correlated with the total number of patent applications in each country-industry pair, suggesting that the centrality measure to some extent also reflects the size of the knowledge pool.====For our analysis, we construct a dataset for Japanese manufacturing MNEs for the period 1995–2011 in which we match data on parent firms, their affiliates, and patents. Using the number of patent applications and the quality-adjusted number of applications by these MNEs as a proxy for innovation outcomes, we examine whether MNEs allocating more R&D activities to countries and industries with higher centrality in the knowledge network tend to show better innovation performance.====Our findings suggest that allocating more R&D activities to more central countries and industries in the knowledge network leads to higher quality innovation as measured by the quality-adjusted number of patent applications, a proxy for R&D outcomes. However, we do not find any significant relationship between the country and industry distribution of offshore R&D and the number of patent applications. On the other hand, we find that the size of R&D expenditure tends to be positively associated with the number of patent applications but does not have a positive relationship with the quality-adjusted number of patent applications. Therefore, our results suggest that while an increase in MNEs’ R&D expenditure is likely to increase the number of patent applications, where they locate R&D is a more important determinant of the quality of innovation than the amount of R&D expenditure.====The remainder of the study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset used and explains our various measures of innovation outcomes and knowledge flows. Section 3 provides an overview of recent trends and patterns in the overseas R&D and patenting of Japanese MNEs and highlights some notable characteristics.

Second, movements of M1 could well reflect the variations of industrial production at the scale of 2–4 years before 1999, but this relationship was reversed at the same scale after 1999. Third, changes in M2 could roughly mirror the fluctuations of inflation at the scale of 3–4 years between 1966 and 1969, and this relationship was reversed at the scale of 1–3 years between 2003 and 2007. This study indicates that in Japan conventional and unconventional monetary policy generate heterogeneous effects on the aggregate economy and the level of heterogeneity partially depends on the chosen instrument.","As one of the two arms of macroeconomic policy, monetary policy plays an important role in influencing the livelihoods of citizens and the macroeconomy (Mankiw, 2019). Estimating the effects of monetary policy on the aggregate economy and examining how these effects change over time are of particular importance to the evaluation and implementation of monetary policy. In general, there are two categories of monetary policy (Apergis et al., 2020; Miyao, 2004) that have been widely used by central banks: conventional monetary policy and unconventional monetary policy. The effects of conventional monetary policy on the aggregate economy have been extensively studied in the literature (Miyao, 2000; Miyagawa and Morita, 2010; Davig and Doh, 2014; Hanson and Stein, 2015; Reifschneider et al., 2015; Wu and Xia, 2016; Tiwari et al., 2018). However, relatively few studies have examined the effects of unconventional monetary policy on the macroeconomy (Papadamou et al., 2019; Inoue and Rossi, 2018; Tiwari et al., 2018; Farmer, 2012; Baumeister and Benati, 2010). In particular, whether unconventional monetary policy has even a significant effect on the aggregate economy or not is still under discussion (Miyao and Okimoto, 2017).====In estimating the effects of monetary policy on the aggregate economy, most of the existing studies employ standard econometric techniques including structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model (Miyao, 2002; Kim, 1999; Kwon, 1998), structural factor model (Hanisch, 2017), Markov-switching VAR model (Inoue and Okimoto, 2008; Fujiwara, 2006), regime-switching SVAR model (Hayashi and Koeda, 2019), time-varying parameter VAR model (Otsubo, 2019; Michaelis and Watzka, 2017) and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model (Hohberger et al., 2020; Abe et al., 2019; Wang, 2019), despite their acknowledged merits, these models cannot capture the frequency dimension of the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy, which is of interest to central banks and policy makers (Tiwari et al., 2018).====Moreover, as heterogeneous market participants usually have different term objectives and could behave simultaneously, while central banks often have various targets which typically operate simultaneously at different timescales (Ramsay and Lampart, 1998; Aguiar-Conraria et al., 2008; Hoevenaars et al., 2014; Chakrabarty et al., 2017; Domanski et al., 2017), the time series of monetary policy indicators and aggregate economic indexes are combinations of elements operating at different frequencies (Aguiar-Conraria and Soares, 2011). Therefore, it is important to use the frequency dimension analysis to examine how the effects of monetary policy on the aggregate economy change in the time-frequency space, which would offer important information to improve the evaluation and design of monetary policy.====In this paper, we examine the characteristics of how conventional and unconventional monetary policy affect the aggregate economy across frequencies and over time in Japan with wavelet multiple coherency and partial coherency analysis. Moreover, the partial coherency would allow us to estimate the effect of monetary policy indicator on the aggregate economy while the other variables are controlled for. In addition, partial phase-differences and partial gains can help us identify the lead-lag relationships in the time-frequency space, which would provide a more elaborate characterization about the effects of monetary policy on the macroeconomy.====Our paper belongs to the stream of literature that tries to investigate the characteristics and implications of how monetary policy affects the aggregate economy (Papadamou et al., 2019; Inoue and Rossi, 2018; Tiwari et al., 2018; Carvalho and Castro, 2017; Miyao and Okimoto, 2017; Khemraj and Yu, 2016; Bowman et al., 2015; Farmer, 2012; Baumeister and Benati, 2010; Smaghi, 2009), however, this research extends the existing studies in a few directions, which constitute the contributions of our investigation.====First, most of the existing literature evaluates the effects of monetary policy on the aggregate economy only in the time domain and completely ignores the frequency dimension (e.g., Hohberger et al., 2020; Abe et al., 2019; Wang, 2019; Otsubo, 2019; Michaelis and Watzka, 2017), however, it has been shown that monetary policy indicators and aggregate economic indexes consist of components functioning at different frequencies (Aloui et al., 2018; Scharnagl and Mandler, 2015; Aguiar-Conraria and Soares, 2011; Aguiar-Conraria et al., 2008), overlooking their frequency dimension would lead to imprecise characterizations about the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy. To overcome this limitation, wavelet multiple coherency and partial coherency are employed to estimate the effects of monetary policy on the aggregate economy across frequencies and over time in this paper.====Second, many studies employ wavelet analysis to evaluate the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy in different economies, for example, Kenourgios et al. (2019) is about European economies, El Alaoui et al. (2019) is about Malaysia, Crowley and Hudgins (2018) is about South Africa, Crowley and Hudgins (2018) is about US, Crowley and Hudgins (2017) is about Europe, Jiang et al. (2015) is about China, Anguiar-Conraria and Soares (2011) is about Europe, however, there are very few studies about Japan. To fill the gap, we employ wavelet analysis to analyze the time-frequency macroeconomic effects of both conventional and unconventional monetary policy in Japan with a recently updated monthly dataset from January 1960 to June 2020.====Third, Okina and Shiratsuka (2006) used discrete wavelet analysis and a Japanese dataset to study the duration effect of monetary policy under zero interest rates, different from their paper, this research employs continuous wavelet multiple coherency, partial coherency, partial phase-differences, and partial gains to elaborately examine the effects of monetary policy on the aggregate economy across frequencies and over time.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the evolution of monetary policy in Japan and the channels through which conventional and unconventional monetary policy affects the aggregate economy. Section 3 presents the literature review. Section 4 discusses the wavelet methodology. Section 5 is about the preliminary data analysis. Section 6 analyzes the time-frequency effects of interest rate on the aggregate economy. Section 7 studies the effects of M1 on the aggregate economy in the time-frequency space.

It further investigates the underlying causes in the lines of firm ownership type, trade mode, product type, and intensive vs. extensive margins. The positive effect comes from, e.g., the increase in the export share of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) and firms with processing trade, and the increase in the export sophistication of privately-owned enterprises (POEs), of ordinary trade, and of intermediate goods. The intensive margin rather than extensive margin is accountable for the effect. Liberalizing FDI does not seem to have any significant effect on product quality.","Countries around the world have generally welcomed and even competed for inward foreign direct investment (FDI), believing that the benefits should exceed the harms. While countries may impose selective restrictions on FDI at earlier stages of economic development to protect domestic firms, they are usually progressively removed as their economies develop. One main argument for liberalizing inward FDI for a developing country is that it can upgrade the basket of goods it produces.====This study examines the effect of the FDI liberalization on the composition of an industry’s exports, particularly whether and how its export sophistication changes. The context is China’s relaxation of FDI regulations upon its accession to WTO in 2002. The government’s revision of the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries (the ====) in March 2002 further opens China’s doors to FDI as part of China’s commitment to its WTO partners. The study exploits that revision as a quasi-natural experiment seeing to better understand the effect of FDI on export sophistication.====This enquiry relates to a body of prior work on the sophistication of Chinese exports. Rodrik (2006) and Schott (2008) both find that China’s exports are unusually sophisticated for a low-income country. Rodrik (2006) points to the consumer electronics sector in support of this observation, though Schott (2008) points out that China is specializing in lower-quality products and thus is not competing directly with products from better-developed economies. Xu (2010) find that China is much less of an outlier in international comparisons of export sophistication, especially if product quality and China’s significant regional inequalities are considered. Yao (2009) suggests that China is not so special, particularly if its processing trade regime and uneven distribution of export across regions are taken into account. He suggests as well that the WTO’s harmonized codes are not well suited to categorizing China’s exports.====Several studies have found that investment from abroad has played an important role in raising the sophistication of China’s exports. In 2008 Ferrantino and his colleagues document that exports by foreign-invested enterprises have consistently accounted for more than 50 percent of China’s exports since 2001, and more than 85 percent of its exports of advanced technology products since 2003 (Ferrantino et al., 2008). Xu and Lu (2009) find that in China an industry’s level of export sophistication is positively related to its share of wholly-owned enterprises from OECD countries. An investigation by Wang and Wei (2010), however, find no relationship between foreign investment and China’s increasing export sophistication. Most earlier studies of export sophistication have paid insufficient attention to the possibility of endogeneity, casting doubt on the validity of their results.====Lu et al. (2017) is the first to exploit the effect of the revision of the ==== in 2002 as an exogeneous shock (Lu et al., 2017)on firm productivity. This study differs from previous works by exploring how changes in FDI ==== in 2002 affect export sophistication and product quality. We find that export sophistication significantly increases after promulgation of the ====, though there is no significant improvement in product quality.

We found negative impacts of the Chinese import penetration on total employment, especially in industries producing competing products to Chinese imports, and a positive impact of the import penetration in the industries from which firms purchase their inputs (upstream import penetration). The negative impacts are mainly driven by firms’ exit from the market while positive impacts are enjoyed by surviving firms. We did not find any significant impacts of the penetration in the industries to which firms sell their products (downstream penetration).","Impacts of trade liberalization on domestic economies have always been a major research topic in international trade literature, and it has recently taken center stage of the literature because many countries in the world have experienced a dramatic increase in imports from China, which has emerged as the factory of the world especially after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. This so-called “China shock” has yielded a concern on the negative impacts on importing countries. Following the recent research on this topic, we analyze impacts of import penetration from China on Japanese job markets.====Some pioneering studies were conducted in the US, where manufacturing sectors were particularly discontent with intensifying competition with China. Autor et al. (2013) found that import competition explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment. Acemoglu et al. (2016) estimated that job losses from rising Chinese import competition over 1999–2011 are in the range of 2.0–2.4 million. Autor et al. (2016) showed, among others, that the impacts of drastic increase in imports from China are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated, and adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commenced. Feenstra et al. (2019) argued that in contrast to the negative effects of Chinese imports on the number of jobs, the global export expansion of US products creates a considerable number of jobs. As a result, it showed that a net loss of jobs is in the range of 0.2–0.3 million. Asquith et al. (2019) argued that the China shock affects US employment mainly through deaths of establishments.====The issue has also been investigated for the European countries. Negative effects of Chinese import penetration on domestic labour markets are found in Balsvik et al. (2015) for Norway, Malgouyres (2017) for France, Keller and Utar (2016) for Denmark. On the other hand, Dauth et al. (2017) found a neutral effect for Germany.====Turning to Japan, the country to be investigated by this paper, one of the early contributions on the effects of trade and investment liberalization on the Japanese domestic economy before the China shock is Tomiura (2004). He examined the relationship between import competition and employment during and after the so-called “Bubble period”, or asset-inflated economy in the 1980s in Japan using gross job flow data combined with import data for 334 four-digit manufacturing industries. It showed, among others, that job creation/destruction associated with plant startups/shutdowns was significantly sensitive to import competition. Some studies also examined the issue of the so-called “exporting job” hypothesis, or “hollowing out” of domestic economy by multinational enterprises (MNEs)’ plant relocations to foreign countries, which was hotly debated in Japan during the period of active plant relocation by Japanese MNEs to foreign countries in response to a rapid and substantial yen appreciation triggered by the Plaza Accord in 1985. For example, Yamashita and Fukao (2010) showed that there is no supporting evidence on the widely held view that overseas operations of MNEs lower home employment.====On the China shock for Japan, Taniguchi (2019) is probably the first study. Using industry/prefecture-level data, it showed that the growth in imports from China positively affected manufacturing employment growth at the prefecture-level in Japan, and the growth is attributed to an increase in intermediate goods’ imports from China. Using an international input-output table, Sasahara (2019) investigated the effects of exports on exporting countries’ labour markets for Japan, as well as the US and China, and found a positive effect especially in service exports for Japan.====The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effects of the China shock on employment in Japan using firm-level data. It complements Taniguchi (2019) by our use of firm-level data and Sasahara (2019) by our focus on imports at a firm-level. Since Japan is one of the countries geographically located closest to China, there would be significant impacts of imports from China on the Japanese economy. Indeed, as Fig. 1 shows, the import penetration ratio for the Chinese imports, defined as (Imports from China)/(Domestic production + Imports from the world–Exports to the world), increased substantially for Japan from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s, compared with other countries including the US with an exception of South Korea.==== During the 2000–2015 period, the number of workers in manufacturing declined more than 3 million, registering the decline in the share of manufacturing in total employment from 19 to 15 percent (Table 1). The impacts of an increase in imports from China might be different for Japan than those for other countries, especially Western countries. Due to geographical proximity, Japan had engaged in actively trading with China for many years, even before China’s accession to the WTO. Due to this long experience, Japanese firms seem able to adjust their production rather quickly against increased imports from China, for example, by upgrading their product quality. There is also a case where Japanese firms benefit from an increase in cheap Chinese imports, which are used as inputs for their production.====We begin with the estimation of the standard equation in the literature. We first investigate the impacts of import penetration from China at a firm-level by using the import data at a product-level. Specifically, we analyze how the change of the import penetration of a product from China affects the growth of employment in the firms that mainly produce the products in Japan between 1996 and 2007.==== We examine this question by employing manufacturing census and economic census in Japan, which covers all manufacturing establishments excluding those with less than or equal to three employees. We also examine the impacts of the import penetration not only for those industries that produce products directly competing with imports, but also for downstream and upstream industries. In this analysis, we investigate the difference of the impacts according to firm sizes. The existing studies for developed countries in this literature have addressed the endogeneity concern on the import penetration from China by using the import penetration from China in other OECD countries as an instrument. This paper follows this strategy but also uses that in South Korea because South Korea seems to have a more similar trade relationship with China to that of Japan, compared to other OECD countries (e.g., European countries and the U.S.).====The estimation is carried out at the product level comparable to a six-digit level of the harmonized system in trade statistics. While a firm-level analysis contributes to uncovering the within-firm change of employment, a product-level analysis enables us to see the net impact that includes the effects involving establishments’ entry and exit. We decompose this “net” employment change according to establishment status. Specifically, inspired by Davis et al. (1996), we classify establishments into three types. The first is the entering establishments (designated as “Entry” establishments) defined as those which did not exist in 1996 but did in 2007. The second is the exiting establishments (“Exit” establishments), i.e., the establishments which existed in 1996 but did not in 2007. The last group is surviving establishments, designated as “Survivor,” defined as those establishments which existed in both 1996 and 2007. The net impacts of import penetration from China are the sum of those in these three types of establishments.====As surveyed above, there exist a large number of studies in this growing literature. Among them, from the methodological point of view, the work of Asquith et al. (2019) is closest to ours. They examined the impacts of import penetration from China on US employment, according to the establishment status. They found the negative net effects on employment and that those negative effects are mainly driven by the exit of establishments. Similar to their result, in the case of Japan, we found significantly negative impact of the Chinese import penetration on the total number of employees, which is essentially driven by a decrease of workers through the exit of establishments. Taniguchi (2019) analyzed the impacts of import penetration from China on employment in Japan. By exploiting variation across regions instead of products, she found the positive impacts of import penetration from China in Japan. Our results suggest that such positive impacts come from those for surviving firms which benefited from a higher import penetration in their upstream industries.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains our empirical framework for investigating the impacts of import penetration from China on employment in Japan. After discussing some empirical issues in Section 3, we report our estimation results in Section 4.

Using finely disaggregated product-level bilateral trade value and quantity data for 98 countries, together with a new data set of detailed information on technical regulations, we answer the following question: If a country faces a greater regulatory burden in a particular destination market, is that country more likely to export a narrower set of goods (the extensive margin) and lower quantities of each good at a higher price (the intensive margin)? We find that beyond the overall trade-diminishing effect, regulatory burdens adversely affect the extensive margin of trade. With respect to the intensive margin, regulatory burdens negatively affect the quantity margin but positively affect the price margin. As the negative effect on the quantity margin is relatively larger in magnitude than the positive effect on the price margin, the result is a negative net impact on the intensive margin.","In international trade, the issue of non-tariff measures (hereafter, NTMs) has gained greater importance in recent years, both academically and in policy discussions. Over the decades, trade liberalization through tariff reductions has played an important part in shaping the current global economy. The “East Asian Miracle” and the rise of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are proof of the positive linkage between active participation in international trade and economic and industrial growth. Nevertheless, the expected growth rate of global trade is slowing down, and with that, there are concerns that NTMs have been (or can be) misused. In such a case, producers and consumers may suffer from higher production costs and prices due to the existence of NTMs and their regulatory requirements. Despite NTMs’ purpose of correcting market failures, the majority of existing studies show a negative effect of NTMs on international trade flows.====In addition, while the main purpose of the NTMs is to protect domestic consumers in a variety of aspects (e.g., health, safety, and environmental protections), in some cases, these NTMs may be utilized as a “hidden” form of protectionism. A study by Grundke and Moser (2019) examined the impact of port refusals (mainly failure to comply with food safety standards) in the US market on the subsequent bilateral trade relationships. They found that past port refusals led to reductions in the trade of the affected goods from the violating countries, and this disproportionately affected developing countries. They also found that during crises, such as the US subprime crisis in 2008, the impact was stronger, suggesting that NTMs may be used as a way for “hidden” protectionism.====Thus, NTMs seem to have a negative effect on international trade, especially for developing countries and smaller firms. In fact, for many sectors, the impact of NTMs is larger than that of tariffs. This is especially so if tariff rates and non-tariff measures are treated as substitutes,==== and lower tariff rates do not necessarily mean that market access is more liberalized. Especially for developing countries of relatively small economic size, continued reliance on external markets and the nurturing of vibrant exporting sectors will be key economic considerations to achieve high growth rates in order to avoid and/or escape from the middle-income trap.====Most previous studies examining trade and the economic effects of the existence of certain kinds of NTMs in importing countries do not take into account how different these regulations are from those of the exporters. In principle, exporters should meet all the domestic regulations in their country of origin. In most cases, countries tend to implement similar types of regulations for a given product. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that there are some overlaps in regulations for a pair of countries. Thus, the real impact of NTMs in importing countries should be ==== (i.e. measures that are not imposed in the exporting country) with which exporters need to comply. Our study focuses on this additionality as the main explanatory variable to analyze the trade impact of NTMs, with particular focus on bilateral extensive and intensive margins of trade.====In this study, we narrow our focus on trade relationships that have positive trade flows. We first examine whether the additional requirements diminish trade values and then look into the different effects on the margins of trade. In other words, we are interested in analyzing which margin of trade accounts for the trade-diminishing effect of the regulatory burdens. Within the destination market of a particular industry, is a country facing more regulatory burdens likely to export a narrower set of goods and lower quantities at higher prices? The study builds on the literature looking at the margins of trade using finely disaggregated product-level trade data (e.g., Hummels and Klenow, 2005; Debaere and Mostashari, 2010; Kehoe and Ruhl, 2013). Specifically, our methodology follows the work of Hummels and Klenow (2005), which decomposes the differences in export flows to a particular market among origin countries into the intensive margin (price as well as quantity components) and the extensive margin (product variety).====Following Hummels and Klenow (2005)’s methodology, Bao and Chen (2013) examined the trade effect of the total number of notifications of technical barriers to trade (TBT) to the WTO by importing countries, looking into the margins of bilateral trade flows aggregated over sectors. Bao and Chen (2013) found that TBT enhanced trade primarily by expanding the range of goods traded rather than by increasing the trade values of each good. In a similar vein, Shepherd (2015) studied the impact of EU product standards on the extensive margin of trade in the textile, clothing, and footwear sectors. Shepherd (2015) found that the international harmonization of standards was associated with an increase in product variety, particularly for the exports from developing economies. While our research interest is closely related to Bao and Chen (2013) and Shepherd (2015), this study contributes to the literature by quantifying regulatory burdens and analyzing their effects on different margins of trade at the sectoral level.====To quantify the regulatory burdens that an exporting firm may face when serving a foreign country’s market, we construct the Additional Compliance Requirement Indicator (ACRI).==== The construction of the ACRI requires detailed information on technical regulations in many countries. This study uses a database created by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in collaboration with many other entities. This database contains a description of each mandatory regulation, which is enforced by national legislation, along with the measure type(s) coded according to UNCTAD’s NTM classification, the affected products specified at the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) six-digit level, and the country codes for the imposing and affected countries.==== Utilizing this detailed information, we can construct the ACRI to estimate the impact of regulatory burdens on margins of trade. Furthermore, unlike Bao and Chen (2013) and Shepherd (2015), we differentiate the price and quantity components of the intensive margin and highlight the contrasting effects of the ACRI on prices and quantities traded.====Using the data for bilateral trade and associated margins calculated at the HS two-digit sector level for 98 × 97 country pairs as well as the constructed ACRI at the sector level, we find that regulatory burdens diminish trade values. To comply with additional requirements in the destination market, exporting firms incur fixed costs to establish the capacity and, subsequently, variable production costs (Ganslandt and Markusen, 2001; Chen et al., 2008; Bao and Chen, 2013). Such fixed costs of adapting products to foreign destination markets are thought to be associated with a narrow set of exported goods on the extensive margin. Meanwhile, higher marginal costs push up the unit price of exported goods, decreasing quantities traded on the intensive margin. Consistent with these predictions, we find that regulatory burdens influence the extensive and intensive margins of trade differently, beyond the overall trade-diminishing effect. Within a particular sector of the destination market country, a country facing more regulatory burdens exports a narrower set of goods on the extensive margin and exports lower quantities of each good at higher prices on the intensive margin.====Aside from the aforementioned literature on the margins of trade, our study is also related to the following two branches of literature analyzing the trade effect of NTMs.==== The first branch of the literature computes the tariff equivalents of NTMs by looking at either the quantity traded or the prices of imported products. The quantity-based approach estimates the ad valorem tariff equivalents by comparing the estimated and actual trade values and determining at what tariff levels the actual trade value would be observed based on international trade data (e.g., Kee et al., 2009). The price-based approach utilizes extensive data on domestic prices, information on transportation costs, and international prices, and considers any price gap to be attributable to the impact of NTMs (e.g., Cadot and Gourdon, 2016; Cadot and Ing, 2015). In both approaches, the issue of NTMs is implied but not addressed specifically. The traditional approach of using tariff equivalents indicates only that there might be some overall trade restrictiveness with regard to imports of a given product, but it does not reveal where that restrictiveness might arise.==== In essence, the tariff equivalent approach leaves the NTM component as a black box. However, it was necessary to rely on this approach given the lack of a systematic database of NTMs.====The second branch of the literature analyzes the trade effect of NTMs at the firm level, paying more attention to firm heterogeneity. For instance, Fontagné et al. (2015) used the WTO database for specific trade concerns reported by exporters, which were then matched to French firms’ export data. The authors found that concerns regarding sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) in the destination market adversely affected firms’ export participation as well as the extensive and intensive margins of exports, with a dampening effect for the larger firms. They also detected a positive effect of SPS-related concerns on the unit value of exports due to possible incentives for firms to increase the price of exported goods. Studies like Fontagné et al. (2015), however, require firm-level export data, which is not available for many countries.====In the absence of firm-level data, we were able to examine the export participation decisions of firms using an alternative methodology developed by Helpman et al. (2008).==== Their methodology is based on two-step procedures: the estimation of the probability of exporting and the estimation of the trade volume, taking into accounts for the selection bias and firm heterogeneity. Following Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (2008)’s methodology, Shepotylo (2016) and Bao (2014) examined the trade effect of NTMs. Given that we only have a single-year snapshot of the detailed information on NTMs for the construction of the ACRI of interest, we refrain from examining the probability of trade. Instead, in focusing on trade relationships that have positive trade flows, we examine whether regulatory burdens diminish trade values and investigate their different effects on the margins of trade.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After describing the NTM, trade value, and quantity data in the next section, Section 3 presents the methodologies used to construct the ACRI and measure the bilateral extensive and intensive margins of trade. Section 4 uses the ACRI to estimate its effects on the bilateral margins of trade, and Section 5 provides concluding remarks.",Impacts of additional compliance requirements of regulations on the margins of trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142521000359,20 May 2021,2021,Research Article,47.0

Employing a multivariate GARCH model, we find that Singapore is the center defined as the market with largest comovements in yields with other local markets in terms of the dynamic conditional correlations, and with the largest effects on other local markets in terms of volatility ====. Neither Hong Kong nor Japan is the center.","Local currency (LCY) bond markets in East Asia have rapidly progressed during the last two decades after the 1997−98 financial crisis in this region. National policymakers in conjunction with the regional initiatives of ASEAN + 3 undertook policy efforts to make bank-dominated financial systems more balanced, and to reduce heavy reliance on foreign debts. More detailed development process of LCY bond markets and their present status in this region are reviewed by Park (2017). LCY bonds in East Asia amounted to $11,463 billion in value as of December 2016 at a compounded annual growth rate of 13.7 % between 2006 and 2016 (Park, 2017 Table 2).====Fig. 1 illustrates that the foreign holdings in LCY government bonds relative to the total outstanding (in percentage) have steadily increased during the last two decades. In particular, the ratio of foreign holdings of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in LCY government bonds seems to have accelerated after the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2008−09. On the other hand, those of China are still less than 10 %.====Table 1 illustrates intraregional cross-border debt security (including bonds) investments for the Asian countries looked from the creditor side. The entry indicates the ratio of the intraregional cross-border debt securities to total foreign debt investment for each country. Generally speaking, those investments have steadily increased over the past 15 years. The growth of cross-border holdings accelerated right after the 2008 GFC. For example, if we compare the holdings in 2009 and those in 2011, the holdings in Hong Kong increased from 18 % to 42 %. The average ratio over seven countries excluding Japan and China increased from 22 % to 34 % over the same periods. Felman et al. (2011) and Spiegel (2012) also find the continuous development in bond markets in the region in trading volumes. Motivated by those stimulating facts, a large number of literatures investigated the bond markets in East Asia. Many of them focused on how bond prices (returns) behave over time and among local markets within the region, and how much they are related to the markets outside of the region.====First, some literature concentrates on the comovements of LCY bond yields. Kim and Lee (2012) indicate the presence of weaker intraregional links among Asian financial markets than their global counterparts. Applying a dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model (DCC-GARCH) introduced by Engle (2002); Tsukuda et al. (2017) find that the integration of developing East Asian LCY government bond markets remains at a low level. Kumamoto and Zhuo (2020) investigate government bond market integration in four ASEAN countries using DCC-GARCH combined with a dynamic factor model.====Second, other literature investigates the transmission (spillover) of returns on financial assets (stocks or bonds) from one market to other markets. Forbes and Rigobon (2002), in an excellent article, examine how much the shocks originated in a country's stock market are transmitted to other countries during the Asian financial crisis of 1997, Mexican currency crisis of 1994, and US stock market crash of 1987. In their model, the shocks are unidirectionally transmitted from an originate country to other country, but not in a reverse way. They find that the high level of comovements in the crisis periods does not indicate contagion but interdependence. Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) propose a spillover index by using variance decomposition technique of a VAR model, and applied it to global equity markets. However, this index depends on variables ordering. Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) extend it to generalized spillover index which are invariant to changes of variables ordering, and estimate volatility spillovers across US asset markets. But this generalized index always presents bidirectional spillover, and loses the ability of identifying the causality of spillover. Belke et al. (2017) apply this generalized index for measuring bond yields transmissions from advanced economies to emerging Asia. They find that changes of US and eurozone government bond yields significantly influence bond yields in emerging Asia, though the levels of influence are different across countries.====The purpose of this paper is to investigate the LCY government bond markets in East Asian countries, and to identify the most dominant (center) market within the region. We consider nine LCY Asian government bond markets comprising Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia, in conjunction with the US market, and identify the center market among three possible candidates of Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. For defining the center market based on the observed data for LCY bond yields, we focus on two numerical measurements, comovements of bond yields between the center and the local markets, and transmission of shocks from the center to the local. We employ a four variable DCC-GARCH model to bond yields of the global (US), the center, the aggregate regional, and the local markets, which provides the above two measurements of dynamic conditional correlations and volatility spillover effects. More rigorous definition of the center market is given in Section 2. It is important to identify which market is actually the center. However, to our knowledge, there are very few studies for the financial center in the age of ongoing recent rapid financial deregulation.====The result of this paper finds Singapore as the center for LCY Asian government bonds market in the sense that the Singapore market exhibits the highest comovements in bond yields with the other Asian local markets, and the idiosyncratic shocks originated in Singapore are most deeply transmitted into the other local markets. Neither Hong Kong or Japan is the center for LCY Asian government bond markets, although Hong Kong comes close. Japan is very far from the center despite the large government bonds outstanding.====We pay careful attention to three sources which could cause biases against Japan in determining the center market: (i) predominance of Japanese market capitalization over other East Asian countries, (ii) effects of different exchange rate systems among three candidates, (iii) role of Japanese Yen as a safe haven currency. Through investigations for the caveat of our analysis, we find that those sources do not affect the results. Based upon the above considerations, there are still two other possible reasons. First, in percentage terms, there is little foreign holdings of LCY Japanese government bonds. Second, even with domestic holdings, the Bank of Japan is a major holder, accounting for about 45 % of the USD 10 trillion. Hence, the market mechanism for bond yields may not work well in the Japanese market. Even if we include China as a center candidate, the results do not change, and Singapore still remains at the center of Asian LCY government bond markets. The fact that Singapore is the center implies that transaction activities are geared towards Singapore, with nearly all parties involved in government bond issuance and trading (lawyers, accountants, financial analysts, investment banks, regulatory authorities, and investors) basing their activities in Singapore.====East Asian government bond markets still remain at a low level of integration in terms of both DCC and volatility spillovers. Policymakers should consider the use of Singapore as the Asian center market to enhance the development LCY government bond markets in this region. First, the center can be controlled so as to increase the comovements among local markets. The government bonds of the center market will be more readily traded by the other Asian countries. Second, policymakers can use the trend in interest rates for the center market as a reference rate for domestic government bond issuance.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the econometric methodology and precise definition of center market. Section 3 details the data used for the study and states preliminary investigations. Section 4 states the empirical results and discusses their implications.

Endoh Masahiro,"Keio University, Faculty of Business and Commerce, Keio University, 2-15-45 Mita, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8345, Japan","Received 15 December 2020, Revised 12 April 2021, Accepted 27 April 2021, Available online 2 May 2021, Version of Record 8 May 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japwor.2021.101076,Cited by (2),"This study estimates the effects of import competition from Asia on the labor income inequality of Japanese manufacturing workers, considering firm and worker heterogeneity. Parameters are obtained from regression results of annual salary by using constructed worker–establishment panel data. The estimated salary change is positively and negatively larger for higher- and lower-paid workers, respectively, implying that labor income inequality among industry–size–skill–gender groups has increased due to imports from Asia. However, the actual evolution of income inequality during 1998–2014 is not successfully explained by Asian imports: other shocks overshadow import competition to determine actual income inequality.","The empirical investigation into the import competition effect on labor income and its inequality has progressed to find that the presence of worker and firm heterogeneity within sectors could increase labor income dispersion across workers and firms. The wage effect of trade on worker heterogeneity, usually reflected in their skill set, has its theoretical background in a wide trade theory base, and rich evidence about the change in skill premium has been obtained thus far from the burgeoning firm- and worker-level studies from the 2010s. Evidence from reduced-form regression for the effect of the strengthening of import competition in the domestic final goods market on skill premium is mixed: insignificant in Amiti and Cameron (2012) for Indonesia, a decrease in Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015) for Brazil, and an increase in Hahn and Choi (2017) for South Korea as well as in Borrs and Knauth (2021) for Germany. Fieler et al. (2018) employ structural estimation of underlying parameters to report the expanding skill premium through import tariff reduction in Colombia.====The effect of import competition on labor income also depends on firm heterogeneity, which stems from firms’ productivity and trade status; it produces different wage effects by firms mainly because of the worker–firm matching mechanism, labor market friction, and the ability to upgrade technology. Amiti and Davis (2012) present a theoretical framework to explain that a decline in output tariffs lowers wages at import-competing firms but boosts wages at exporting firms; this is supported empirically by Indonesian data. Structural estimations by Ritter (2015) for Canada and Helpman et al. (2017) for Brazil, incorporating both worker and firm heterogeneity, show that trade increases wage inequality.====This study takes a different approach to the issue about the causality from import competition to labor income and its inequality from preceding studies: comparing annually the actual income inequality with the hypothetical inequality predicted from imports from Asia and estimates of annual salary regression. The benefit of this approach is that it enables researchers to evaluate how much the prediction from import competition explains the actual labor income dynamics on a yearly basis, and it incorporates a higher frequency of comparison between predicted and actual figures than previous studies. Predicted labor income disparities cover 17 years from 1998 to 2014, and they are calculated from annual changes in imports from Asia. Parameters for calculating labor income disparities are obtained from regression results of annual salary by using worker–establishment panel data. I conduct this research by employing a dataset of Japanese manufacturing workers.====In this study, I choose an annual salary as an index of labor income. As for the factors of the firm- and worker-level heterogeneity, I use firms’ sizes, workers’ skills, and workers’ gender, and can therefore explain the change in labor income inequality between industry–size–skill–gender groups. An import competition variable is constructed from the ratio of import values from Asian countries to the values of total supply to Japanese consumers in each of the 108 industries. The estimated annual salary change is positively larger for workers who gain higher salaries and are presumably working for large firms in industries where Japan has a comparative advantage, while it is negatively larger for workers whose salary is low. It is also shown that the change in labor income inequality predicted from actual changes in Japanese imports does not succeed well in explaining the actual change of annual salary inequality between industry–size–skill–gender groups in a reconstructed population of Japanese manufacturing workers. This result indicates that import competition has a marginal effect on the actual evolvement of labor income inequality compared with other shocks, even though potentially international trade would widen income inequality in Japan.====Trade impact on employment in Japan has been examined in detail thus far by previous studies, using input–output tables or regression analysis methods (Tomiura, 2003, 2004; Sakurai, 2004, 2017; Sasaki, 2007; Kiyota, 2012, 2016; Endoh, 2019; Feenstra and Sasahara, 2019; Sasahara, 2019; Taniguchi, 2019). Compared with its employment effect, however, the effect on wages has scarcely been examined. A few exceptions are Sakurai (2004, 2017) and Endoh (2018, 2021), and the present study differentiates itself from the previous studies in the following ways. First, Sakurai (2004, 2017) analyses trade effects on wage ratios between worker groups with industry-level data and factor content approach. The present study utilizes the rich data of individual-level yearly observations to see the change of wages themselves in each worker group as well as wage ratios between groups. Second, Endoh (2018) estimates import competition effect on wages of employees in relatively large firms. The present study expands its scope further to include employees in smaller firms and evaluate import-induced annual salary changes and labor income inequality among manufacturing workers. Third, Endoh (2021) focuses on the substitutability between labor and imported inputs in a within-firm labor market and estimates the impact of offshoring by a firm on the salary and working hours of its employees. This study complements Endoh (2021) in the sense that it aims to reveal the comprehensive effect of increasing imports from Asia, including the strengthening competition in final goods market, competition-induced productivity increase, and utilization of imported goods as intermediate inputs, on the salaries of Japanese employees.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes labor income panel data of Japanese manufacturing workers constructed for this study and the annual change in labor income inequalities calculated from this set of data. Section 3 explains the Mincerian labor income equation and estimation results used for simulation in the next section, while Section 4 calculates the estimated trade effects on annual salary disparity and discusses the results. Section 5 summarizes the findings and discusses the significance of this research.",The effect of import competition on labor income inequality through firm and worker heterogeneity in the Japanese manufacturing sector,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142521000232,2 May 2021,2021,Research Article,49.0

Using individual-level survey data, we investigate the impact of both economic/socioeconomic (cognitive) and noneconomic (or noncognitive) factors, the latter including behavioral bias, communication skills, social stance and subjective well-being. The results indicate that individuals that are male, richer, more educated, younger and from smaller families tend to agree with immigration. More importantly, noneconomic factors also matter, with those that have lower time preference, better English language skills and overseas experience tending to be more positive to the perception of immigration. In addition, individuals trusting neighborhoods rather than the government, that make donations to society and that keep in good health tend to be more positive toward immigration.","Anti-immigration sentiment is evident in many developed countries. The recent wave of globalization has facilitated the movement of capital and labor across nations, and consequently, labor in developing countries and emerging economies has flowed into many developed countries in search of jobs, safety, higher quality of life and higher wages. However, immigrants are often considered as a source of downward pressure on wages and increased pressure on employment in the local labor market and this would drive cultural conflict, cause crimes, deteriorate fiscal conditions and public services, and then evoke anti-immigration sentiment and xenophobia. In fact, the radical right-wing parties spreading over Europe often argue for prohibiting immigration as part of their political platforms. Such anti-immigration sentiments appear to intensify with protectionist trade movements, and this has resulted in a split of the views on globalization.====In terms of existing research, Borjas (1999) analyzes whether the labor inflows from immigration give rise to welfare losses and points out the possibility of immigration indeed exerting downward pressure on wage rates and crowding out local labor. This is the basic mechanism that leads local people to oppose immigration in fear of unemployment and lower wages. Some empirical analyses have confirmed this mechanism including, for instance, Borjas (2003) in the US, Aydemir and Borjas (2007) in North America more broadly and Felbermayr et al. (2010) in Germany. However, rather less attention has been devoted to the factors affecting antimigration sentiment at the individual level. This paper sheds light on this important policy decision by investigating what the Japanese think of immigration using the Keio Household Panel Survey (KHPS).====Japan is an exceptional country in terms of its immigration policy in that it does not accept much immigration at all. Although Japan has a long commitment to trade liberalization, successfully reducing tariff rates and nontariff barriers for trade with Japan, it is reluctant to accept immigration. For the most part, immigration into Japan has been highly regulated, except for partially accommodating some temporary workers and a few technical intern trainees. However, Japan has recently seen some gradual changes in foreign labor and immigration policy with several reforms proposed by its former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan faces a looming shortage of labor due to the rapid speed of growth in its elderly population and depopulation. To overcome this difficulty and promote economic growth, the Japanese government has recently ratified several free trade agreements to increase the sale of Japanese exports in foreign markets and to benefit from the lower prices of imports.==== In parallel, the Japanese government also initiated several policy reforms concerning the acceptance of a limited number of foreign workers, which is expected to help mitigate its labor force shortage. The number of foreign workers dramatically increased over the last decade: 0.68 million (1.46 million) foreign workers live in Japan as of October 2011 (October 2018) (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan). Skilled foreign labors were first accepted as special status of residence in 2014. The special status of residence was limited to foreign professional workers. In 2016, nursery workers were added to the list. In 2018, the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act was revised, in which unskilled foreign workers were to be accepted in 14 specific jobs (e.g. agriculture, fishery, construction, and restaurant). The revision of 2018 was crucial in terms of allowing unskilled foreign workers to hold residential status, because the status of unskilled foreign workers was previously temporary worker, technical intern trainee and student. In spite of the crucial policy decision, congressional discussion on the revision of the law did not seem to be enough. Several mass-media and public organizations criticized such process of revision (e.g. Takasaka, 2019).==== Some scholars pointed out public concerns and several problems involved by the revision (e.g. Kawamoto, 2018)==== . Main concerns were cultural conflicts, the rise of crime rates and deterioration of labor conditions for foreign workers as well as the Japanese workers such as higher unemployment rates, lower wage and long-hour working.====Given these circumstances, it is worthwhile to investigate the immigration sentiments of Japanese at the individual level. The survey was conducted in 2017. Although this is the timing before the revision of the law of immigration control, there has already been some public debates on whether foreign workers and immigration can mitigate a looming shortage of labor due to depopulation (e.g. Hagiwara and Nakajima, 2014; Masuda, 2014; Masuda and Toyama, 2015).==== The public debates on immigration and depopulation would affect the survey. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the extent to which Japanese attitudes toward immigration are affected not only by economic factors and individual characteristics, but also by several noneconomic (or noncognitive) factors such as behavioral bias, social stance and subjective well-being, as emotional and volitional processes.====The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents the data set used in the analysis and provides some facts. Sections 4 and 5 report the estimation results.

Our question here is that, if the manufacturing firms established foreign manufacturing plants and engaged in sourcing inputs and exporting outputs, have they changed their domestic employment composition toward service workers? This is what we call servicification of manufacturing firms in this paper. To answer this question, using Korean firm-establishments matched data, we examine changes in the shares of service employment in manufacturing firms from 2008 to 2013, when those firms are participating in both import-and-export and foreign direct investment (i.e., GVC firms). We find that the two-way trading firms that own manufacturing plants in foreign countries—and particularly in nearby foreign countries—have changed their domestic employment structures to increase the number of service workers they employ. Moreover, the relatively greater increase in the share of R&D workers than of wholesale-and-retail workers serves as further evidence of the servicification of domestic manufacturing. Overall, our findings suggest that Korean firms who engage in GVCs through both trade and foreign direct investment have reorganized domestic labor structure to be able to provide high value-added headquarter services for their manufacturing plants that are closely located in foreign countries.","Manufacturing firms in a global value chain (GVC) engage in not only international trade but also foreign direct investment (FDI). On the one hand, firms in a GVC may import inputs and export final products in order to save production costs. On the other hand, they may even expand production plants abroad in order to avoid underinvestment problems of input suppliers. According to Chor (2019), the GVC literature of international economics has extensively studied either manufacturing firms’ optimal sourcing decision over countries (Yeaple, 2003; Grossman and Helpman, 2005; Grossman et al., 2006; Antràs and de Gortari, 2020; Antràs et al., 2017); or global manufacturers’ optimal choice for firm boundary (Antràs, 2003; Antràs and Helpman, 2004; Antràs, 2005; Antràs and Chor, 2013; Del Prete and Rungi, 2017; Alfaro et al., 2019). The former views the GVC as importer-exporter linkage between foreign inputs and domestic outputs, while the latter interprets the GVC as an investment or ownership structure between foreign suppliers and domestic producers. As we notice in the literature, they have examined in common the GVC within manufacturing processes alone.====However, a concept of the GVC can be further extended to encompass an entire sequential linkage of value-added creation processes in the global markets, starting from R&D, product design, financing; linking to manufacturing inputs and assembling for finished goods; and then finally ending at sales and distribution to consumers. In this extended GVC, the middle part of manufacturing processes tends to be associated with lower value-added activities than both ends of the service activities. So, in order to create high value for products that they produce, a global manufacturing firm in this extended GVC can choose to engage in the high value-added services activities – what we call as servicification==== in this paper – by leveraging the low value-added manufacturing activities of the GVC. The servicification would help the firm to increase market values for products they sell and eventually enhance profitability in a competitive global product market. In this paper, we empirically attempt to show that taking advantage of the manufacturing part of the GVC in terms of both trade and investment linkages is the key driver for manufacturing firms to shift their internal resources toward service activities.====To this end, we use a universe dataset of all Korean establishments in both the manufacturing and service sectors and match the establishment units to their owner firm who is in the manufacturing sector. This allows us to build up our dependent variable, an index for servicification at the firm-level: a share of employment in service establishments owned by a manufacturing firm. For the main explanatory variable reflecting firms’ participation in global value chains, we utilize a firm-level dataset that includes information on two kinds of globalization activities - trade and foreign direct investment. When manufacturing firms participate in a global value chain, they import intermediate inputs and export final outputs. Furthermore, some of them continue to set up an internal global production network by establishing foreign subsidiaries across countries. With this idea, we define a firm’s GVC participation as an interacting term between both input importer-output exporter ==== owner of foreign affiliates. With the servicification index and the GVC participation indicator at firm-level, we investigate whether a manufacturing firm who participates in the GVC changes the share of workers in service establishments in the domestic market compared to other firms without GVC participation.====In this empirical strategy, we may face a potential endogeneity between FDI and servicification; there exists a possibility that firms may first change their labor composition before relocating their production units abroad. This alerts us to use instrumental variables (IV) for FDI firms. We use three instrumental variables at the 3-digit industry-level. They are the average share of FDI to total trade, the share of FDI to total trade calculated at the aggregate level, and the share of imported inputs to total imports. Our idea is that when an industry is more open to foreign direct investment than other industries, a firm in the industry is likely to engage in foreign direct investment individually as well. However, one more problem we have here is that due to the nature of non-linearity of the endogenous variable, GVC participation indicator, the IV model faces a technical problem of inconsistent estimators. To tackle this problem, we adopt the control function approach with the instrumental variables suggested in Imbens and Wooldridge (2007).====For further robustness tests, we also conduct several additional analyses. First, since we use the firm-establishment matched dataset over a 5-year period from 2008 to 2013, only the surviving firms during the period are included in our regression analysis and our empirical results may be driven by the selected sample. So, we apply a two-stage Heckman selection model to deal with the selection issue. Second, our dependent variable is the share of service workers within a firm. So, the increase in the share may be attributed to the decrease in the total number of employments rather than the increase in the number of service workers. To verify whether the servicification occurs through increased service workers, we use alternative dependent variables: employment rates of service workers and the number of domestic service affiliates. Last but not the least, in our main analysis the FDI indicator at firm level is defined as a dummy variable for firms’ ownership of foreign manufacturing subsidiaries. This is what we intend to define intra-firm global production network reflecting a GVC participation. However, there is a possibility that servicification of manufacturing firms may occur through intra-firm global service network. To see this, we further disaggregate types of foreign affiliates into manufacturing and service ones.====This paper offers several main empirical findings for the servicification trend of manufacturing firms in global value chains. First, manufacturing firms, who import foreign intermediate goods and export final goods ==== own foreign manufacturing affiliates, increase the share of workers in their service establishments in domestic markets, when compared to firms who do not trade nor invest abroad. However, the trade linkage alone did not influence the servicification trend. This implies that manufacturing firms’ labor reorganization toward service activities tends to be triggered by the investment relationship between domestic producers and foreign suppliers. Second, the servicification trend occurs in R&D establishments than in wholesale-and-retail establishments. Similarly, the servicification of manufacturing firms appears through increasing regular workers rather than non-regular workers. These two results imply that the servicification may help manufacturing firms move up toward high quality and high value-added service activities in the extended GVC. Third, these findings are clear when their foreign manufacturing affiliates are located in countries near their home country, but disappear when they are far from home. One way to give a rationale for this result is that as the distances between home and foreign countries are increased the communication costs between home R&D center and foreign production facilities are increased as well==== .====Related literature in international economics has provided similar evidence that as multinational enterprises (MNEs) relocated manufacturing plants abroad, they reduced the number of domestic plants and employment of production workers (for example, Gibson and Harris, 1996; Van Beveren, 2007; and Bandick, 2010). If manufacturing firms reduced their production workers by downsizing manufacturing plants, how would they manage the service plants that remain inside the firms? Would they be able to strengthen their service functions and increase the number of service workers? Our study contributes to the literature by answering this question.====Apart from the GVC literature, we may consider that even purely domestic firms have several plausible reasons for maintaining large shares of service workers. First, highly productive firms would have larger shares of service workers than less productive firms if they have low marginal costs generated by R&D activities. For example, Atkeson and Burstein (2010) modeled how endogenous innovation influences firm productivity and Aw et al. (2011) showed that endogenous productivity changes through R&D using Taiwanese data. Second, more capital-intensive firms may be likely to have larger shares of highly skilled service workers if capital and numbers of highly skilled service workers are complementary. The complementarity between physical capital and skilled workers has been extensively reported in the labor economics literature. For instance, Krusell et al. (2000) showed a lower elasticity of substitution between capital and skilled workers than between capital and unskilled workers. Third, to develop a variety of products or to manage many plants, multi-product or multi-plant firms may need larger shares of service workers than single-product or single-plant firms. Indeed, some recent studies have shown that domestic firms with high shares of service workers outperform those with low shares of service workers in terms of productivity and output growth.==== Bernard and Fort (2015) and Morikawa (2016) examined factoryless goods producers==== in US ICT and Japanese wholesale industries. Bernard et al. (2017) examined Danish manufacturing firms switching to service sectors and Crozet and Milet (2017) studied French manufacturing firms who sell services. While these studies generated insights into the economic performance of firms’ service upgrades, none of them addressed what caused these firms to make a transition from manufacturing to service sectors. In this paper, we will control these other factors that may affect the servicification and elucidate the servicification of domestic manufacturing by investigating the impacts of multinational manufacturing firms in GVC on shares of their domestic service workers.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce our key variable, the servicification measure, and discuss basic facts regarding servicification in Korea and the role of multinational firms. Section 3 describes our main empirical model and presents our findings; in particular, we discuss quality and types of servicification and the effects of location. In section 4, we conduct several robustness tests and section 5 summarizes our results and discusses their implications.",Global value chains and servicification of manufacturing: Evidence from firm-level data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142521000219,1 April 2021,2021,Research Article,51.0

However, we know little about who demands reciprocity in trade liberalization. This paper characterizes reciprocitarians based on a survey of 10,816 individuals in Japan. Workers in protected sectors tend to demand reciprocity in import liberalization, but oppose the demand for foreign countries to open their markets. In contrast, individuals in managerial occupations tend to demand foreign market opening, but reject the idea of no import liberalization without reciprocity. We also examine the effects of education, nationalism, and risk aversion.","The concept of gains from trade is one of the most essential elements in basic economics, but ==== trade liberalization has been unpopular in many countries.==== ==== trade liberalization has led actual trade negotiations. Based on a survey of around ten thousand individuals in Japan, we identify individual characteristics of people demanding reciprocity in international trade. The distinction of reciprocitarians from protectionists is important, as reciprocal trade is not necessarily supported by protectionists.====Reciprocity is observed in many economic transactions in the real world as a device for contract enforcement. “When, for some reasons, the market ‘fails,’ the most common corrections and efficient substitutes rely on a variety of reciprocitarian motives” (Kolm, 2006: p.378). Many people behave reciprocally but a non-negligible number do not, as surveyed by Fahr and Gächter (2000).==== “Which social and economic conditions produce the propensity to reciprocate? … At the empirical level, … little is known” (Fahr and Gächter, 2000: p.178). We discuss who demands reciprocity to the national government in international trade, not who reciprocates in personal interactions. However, our investigation of policy preferences based on individual-level data will be informative, and not limited to trade liberalization.====Reciprocity has a critical influence, especially on international trade, where market failures are significant due to the absence of a common government.==== Reciprocity in international trade implies that a country adjusts its trade barriers, typically tariff rates, on imports in exchange for foreign trade barriers on the country’s exports.==== In the agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), the member governments state that they enter into “reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements directed to the substantial reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade”.==== The WTO allows any country to raise its tariffs when its trading partners withdraw equivalent concessions. The aggressive demand of bilateral reciprocity to trading partners by the U.S. during the Trump administration reminds us of the power of reciprocity in trade negotiations.==== With the weakening functions of the WTO dispute settlements, we might encounter even stronger demand for reciprocity in future trade talks.====The principle of reciprocity refers to the balance of “concessions.” From a mercantilist viewpoint, trade negotiators regard import liberalization as “concessions.” Improved market access arguments presented in public news on trade negotiations are analogous to the principle of reciprocity. Hence, in international trade, the reciprocity argument has long been regarded as a political or mercantilist view, not one rooted in orthodox economics. Bagwell and Staiger (1999), however, formalize reciprocity in standard trade theory and prove that reciprocal trade agreements can neutralize the terms-of-trade effect of large countries, thus improving the welfare of trading countries.==== Consequently, it is worthwhile for us to focus on reciprocity and empirically characterize supporters for reciprocity based on individual data.====The empirical investigation of individual characteristics based on survey data is not new in the trade literature. Balistreri (1997); Beaulieu (2002), and Scheve and Slaughter (2001) are among the pioneering studies, while Mayda and Rodrik (2005) conducted an international comparison on this issue. Stylized facts established by these studies are that workers in import-competing industries and unskilled workers tend to be protectionist, as predicted by the orthodox trade theory. Previous research also detected significant impacts of education, behavioral biases, and other personal characteristics. Blonigen (2011) detects the persistent effect of education on trade policy preferences, even for retirees. Tomiura et al. (2016) find that people strongly influenced by status-quo bias or risk aversion tend to oppose trade liberalization even after controlling for their standard labor market attributes.==== Yamamura and Tsutsui (2019) analyze the support for trade liberalization based on a survey using respondents’ childhood experiences as an instrumental variable for non-cognitive skills. Ito et al. (2019) report a significant regional effect; i.e. a protectionist propensity in agricultural areas, even if the respondents themselves are not working in agriculture.==== However, all these studies characterize protectionists, not reciprocitarians.====The investigation of trade policy preferences in Japan is worthwhile in its own right. As will be reviewed later, Japan’s import tariffs on agricultural goods are much higher than those in many other industrial countries. On the other hand, Japan has long been one of the largest exporters of manufactured products (automobiles as a prime example) in world trade. As a result, Japan has experienced pressures of reciprocal trade liberalization from trading partners. Trade negotiations, especially with the U.S., have been characterized by a strong demand for import liberalization coupled with threats of export restraints, as Irwin (2017) mentioned in the history of U.S. trade policy. This paper, therefore, examines who supports reciprocal trade liberalization in Japan by characterizing them in terms of their industry, occupation, age, gender, income, or other socio-economic attributes of individuals in Japan. The characterization of reciprocitarians in our study will have useful implications for discussing trade liberalization in other countries, particularly those in intense trade conflicts, with growing exports and closed markets.====We need to investigate individuals’ opinions on both the import and export sides of reciprocity. Import liberalization (conditional on partners’ liberalization) and export expansion (by opening partners’ markets) are the indispensable pillars of reciprocal trade. People, especially those working in protected sectors, are likely to demand reciprocity in import liberalization, unless they are confident in gains from unilateral trade liberalization. Gains from improved access to foreign markets are likely to be welcomed by a wide range of people. We will investigate whether these predicted responses are observed in the survey data.====To preview our principal findings, workers in agriculture (the protected sector in the Japanese case) tend to demand reciprocity in import liberalization, but they oppose requesting foreign markets to open for expanding exports. On the other hand, people in managerial occupations tend to demand export expansion, but they reject the idea that import liberalization should be reciprocated by trading partners. These findings suggest the difficulty in widening political support for reciprocal trade liberalization. Our estimation results also show that individuals who are very proud of their own homeland tend to demand reciprocity in liberalizing imports. This paper also examines the effects of education, age, gender, and other individual characteristics on the demand for reciprocal trade in our sample of more than ten thousand individuals in Japan. We check the robustness of our results by estimating binary and ordered logit models, or by excluding undecided or unsure respondents.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Using the introduction of Arrowhead, a low-latency high-frequency trading platform, to the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the financial crisis of 2008 as natural experiments, we compare the resilience of ==== and equities in terms of liquidity and volatility. The results indicate that the introduction of Arrowhead improved the quality of the Japanese REIT market but also increased the probability of flash crashes. We also find that although the financial crisis significantly deteriorated overall equity market quality, the Japanese REIT market was resilient. Finally, using a difference-in-differences regression model, we show that the higher transparency and better price discovery of REITs, compared to non-REITS, protected them from the negative effects of the financial crisis and the introduction of Arrowhead. Overall, our analysis shows that REITs are more resilient than non-REITs.","Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are an increasingly popular investment vehicle. A 2016 report by Ernst and Young shows that the global investment in REITs increased from approximately $737 billion in 2010 to $1.7 trillion in 2016. During this period, the U.S. REIT market grew by almost 150 % and non-U.S. markets by 100 %.==== Yet, the investment risks associated with these assets remain unclear, specifically in comparison to common equities, because the underlying assets in REITs (i.e., real estate) are mostly localized, whereas the underlying assets of common equities (i.e., non-REITs) could be affected by the broader market. Clayton and MacKinnon (2000) find that REITs exhibit lower liquidity than non-REITs. However, Nelling et al. (1995) document that REIT liquidity is similar to that of common stocks. REITs also should have lower volatility (Gentry et al., 2003), as their value is mostly in underlying properties and there is not a large information gap between managers and investors due to dividend payments. Yet, prior studies show large growth in return volatility for REITs around the financial crisis of 2008 (Jain et al., 2017). This paper attempts to understand how REITs differ from common equities. Specifically, we compare REITs with non-REITs using two external shocks that provide a quasi-natural experiment setting: the introduction of a high-frequency trading (HFT) platform and the financial crisis of 2008. As these shocks are not created by a single security or issuer, they provide a more credible setting to investigate whether REITs differ from common stocks in terms of investment risks.====The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has the third largest market capitalization in the world after the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Unlike other developed markets, however, the Japanese stock market is not fragmented: any given stock can be traded on only one exchange. On January 4, 2010, the TSE introduced the Arrowhead high-speed trading platform, which reduced latency (time elapsed between order placement and order execution) from six seconds to two milliseconds, about 3,000 times faster than the previous trading platform. Arrowhead eliminates matching cycle delays by instantaneously updating the limit order book (LOB) and executing orders (Uno and Shibata, 2011). HFT now accounts for approximately 50%–70% of all trades in many markets, including an estimated 50 % of U.S. equity trading volume.==== Unlike the U.S. markets, where latency decreased gradually, the TSE experienced a shock of increased trading speed. Within 14 months of the Arrowhead launch, trading volume increased from 0% to 43 % (TSE Annual Report, 2011).====The growth of HFT and its alleged role in many flash crashes has caught the attention of regulators,==== and many countries have attempted to minimize its negative impacts on markets. The Japanese REIT (J-REIT) market is among the largest in the world, with a valuation exceeding $30 billion. We study whether the introduction of HFT in the Japanese market led to changes in volatility and liquidity of J-REITs. We then compare these changes with changes in volatility and liquidity of commonly traded stocks on the TSE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the impact of HFT on J-REITS and stock market quality.====We extend the literature on HFT by exploiting a semi-natural experiment from the Japanese market. Academic studies offer no definitive answer on the costs and benefits of HFT. Theoretical models of stock market quality offer competing predictions regarding the impact of increased trading speed. Foucault et al.’s (2003) theoretical model shows that faster markets can raise adverse selection costs and deteriorate stock market quality because informed liquidity demanders can more closely monitor the market for any temporary mispricing or stale quotes. In contrast, Foucault et al. (2005); Baruch (2005), and Boehmer et al. (2005) indicate that faster trading increases competition among liquidity suppliers at various price points, suggesting an overall increase in market quality in terms of higher liquidity and lower volatility. Despite extensive research in this area, no consensus has emerged on the impact of HFT on market quality, largely for two reasons. First, it has proven difficult to control for non-HFT determinants of market quality (e.g., information asymmetry). Second, most empirical research on HFT focuses on noisy proxies of HFT, such as number of messages (Hendershott et al., 2011; Gai et al., 2012), quotes-to-trade ratio (Jain et al., 2016), and strategic trading (Hasbrouck and Saar, 2009).====Prior studies generally suggest that HFT is a socially beneficial financial innovation that improves trading costs and price discovery, resulting in increased trading volume and improved liquidity (Brogaard, 2010; Chordia et al., 2008; Boehmer and Kelley, 2009; Hendershott et al., 2011). Others argue that HFT may increase volatility, entropy, and systemic risk (Boehmer et al., 2013; Hendershott and Moulton, 2011; Jain et al., 2016; Cecen et al., 2021). Notably, HFT could affect systematic risk emanating from trading behaviors, such as aggressive liquidity demands or absence of quotes from liquidity suppliers (Jain et al., 2016), but there is no reason to believe that it also affects the information gap between insiders (managers) and investors. To the extent that the fundamental characteristics (e.g., information asymmetry between investors and managers) of traded securities affect trader behaviors, we should be able to capture those effects by examining the introduction of HFT. Thus, by studying the impact of Arrowhead’s introduction on the liquidity and price informativeness of securities traded, we can provide relatively clean evidence on whether these characteristics vary significantly between REITs and non-REITs.====We also examine whether the 2008 financial crisis affected REITs and non-REITs differently. As one of most severe financial crises in the last several decades, it affected nearly all financial securities and markets, reducing investment opportunities and increasing information asymmetry. We hypothesize that as REITs face lower informational asymmetry and have better price discovery, they should have been more resilient during the financial crisis than non-REIT common stocks. However, REITs can be adversely impacted by financial crises if their dependence on external financing curtails investors’ ability to exploit profitable investment opportunities (Mooradian and Yang, 2001). Ooi et al. (2012) document that REITs have greater exposer to idiosyncratic volatility than typical common stocks due to inherently localized and illiquid real estate holdings.====By analyzing REITs, we can overcome some of the complications faced by prior studies. In particular, REITs are relatively straightforward to value, as the market value of their properties captures most of their overall value. In addition, tax rules and a high institutional ownership significantly restrict the activities REITs can undertake, so management has less impact on the value of a REIT than it has on typical industrial corporations.==== Furthermore, the cash flows for most REITs might be less volatile due to long-term lease agreements with tenants. These unique characteristics of REITs reduce information asymmetry and facilitate efficient price discovery. Thus, by focusing on REITs, we can reduce the confounding impact of stock-specific determinants of market quality.====Our results indicate that the introduction of Arrowhead improved overall liquidity and reduced volatility. We also show that the financial crisis reduced liquidity and increased volatility in Japanese markets. Consistent with the idea that REITs have lower informational asymmetry and better price discovery, we find that compared to common stocks, REITs were far less affected by the financial crisis and by the introduction of Arrowhead,==== though J-REITs did not benefit as much from the introduction of Arrowhead as other common equities. Our regression estimates indicate that because REITs already have efficient price discovery, they benefit less than non-REITs from improvements in price discovery.====We find some evidence confirming the lower information asymmetry of REITs, compared to non-REITs, from the analysis of the financial crisis. Our results indicate that the negative effects of the financial crisis on liquidity and volatility were significantly lower for J-REITs than for non-REITs.====Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways. We extend the HFT literature by showing its effects on liquidity and volatility in a non-U.S. market. The only other study to examine the Japanese market, Jain et al. (2016) also analyzes the impact of the Arrowhead launch. However, they analyze its impact on systemic risk and document that HFT negatively impacts the stock markets by increasing the correlation and covariance in stock returns and order flow across the entire stock market. They do not analyze liquidity or volatility. Our analysis sheds light on whether REITs complement or substitute equity investments. Thus, our analysis has implications for investors who allocate wealth using REITs as an investment class. Traders incur liquidity costs when they invest in or divest from asset classes in response to wealth shocks or market conditions====Our study also provides evidence that although the 2008 financial crisis affected J-REITs, the magnitude of the effect was smaller than that for non-REIT stocks. Whether REITs have unique characteristics that are not present in non-REIT securities is debatable. Glascock et al. (2004) document that the foreign exchange market crisis of 1997 did not affect REITs significantly when compared with non-REITs. However, unlike the 1997 crisis, the 2008 financial crisis originated in the real estate market and hence, analyzing its effect on REIT market quality could provide interesting insights. Furthermore, the REIT market in many non-U.S. markets was small in 1997 and probably insulated from foreign exchanges.====Finally, this is the only study to our knowledge to systematically examine how HFT affects REITs and non-REITs. HFT was not dominant during the periods studied in prior literature. Thus, it is an empirical question whether it affects REITs in the same way it affects non-REITs. Our study also extends Cannon and Cole (2011) and Jain et al. (2017) by analyzing the effect of the 2008 financial crisis and HFT on stock market quality for J-REITs. By showing that the introduction of HFT and the 2008 financial crisis had insignificant effects on REITs, we provide cleaner evidence on the resilience of these securities vis-à-vis other securities.",Are REITs more resilient than non-REITs?

Based on panel data of individual players during the 2012–2016 seasons of the Japan Professional Football League (J League), we found; (1) In the top-league, changing team reduced player’s performance and their performance improved as player’s tenure of the team and also tenure of J League increased. (2) returns from acquiring team specific skills on time of play in the game increase and then decrease as years have passed. (3) benefit from moving team depends on the timing of moving, and so rookie players can benefit from moving when team tenure reach 4 years or more. (4) In the second league, neither team tenure nor experience of the professional football player does not influence player’s performance.","How and to what extent does the productivity of labor decline when an employed worker is displaced from a job he has been working? This is one of the major questions a large number of researchers have been tackling in labor economics (e.g., Topel, 1991; Jacobson et al., 1993; Kambourov and Manovskii, 2009). Human capital can be classified into general and specific skills based on its influence on employee productivity. Specific skills are accumulated through experience. This can be roughly classified into three types. First, consider the workers of Coca-Cola. They cannot use their skills in Pepsi. When a skill gained in one firm is not useful in another, that skill is firm specific. Second, workers in a manufacturing industry have no use of their skills if they change work to another industry. This type of skill is industry specific. Third, workers belonging to the research department of a firm cannot use their research skills in the sales department. This shows that every occupation requires specific skills. Thus, a question that arises is, what are the important specificities in the labor market? The literature has conflicting views on this. Researchers have found that investment in occupation-specific skills is an important determinant of worker productivity (Shaw, 1984, 1987; Zangelidis, 2008; Kambourov and Manovskii, 2009)==== . Some have observed that tenure in an industry has a significant impact on worker productivity (e.g., Neal, 1995; Parent, 2000). These studies have tried to derive general arguments on the role of occupational and industry specificities in the labor market from data covering various industries and occupations. This paper deals with the issue of firm-specific skills from a panel dataset of professional sports, because sports teams can be considered as firms, and we can pursue the player mobility between teams to explore the importance of professional skills.====Professional sports provide very useful data to examine the relation between productivity and tenure, because sports data include various individual performance records for sportspersons to pursue (e.g., Chapman and Southwick, 1991; Ohtake and Ohkusa, 1994; Ohkusa and Ohtake, 1996; Prisinzano, 2000.). Accumulated team-specific capital reduces the likelihood of player turnover when the firm-specific human capital hypothesis holds true in professional sports (Glenn et al., 2001)==== . However, these works did not consider the difference in quality of goods provided by firms. The quality of goods provided by firms improve as the industry develops. In the less-developed stage of an industry, firms need to produce standardized and less differentiated goods in mass production (Otsuka and Sonobe, 1996). In this case, firms demand labor with general skills rather than specific skills. However, in the developed stage, the quality of goods has to improve and be differentiated for firms to survive under competitive pressure, and for this, firm-specific skills are more likely to be required. In short, the importance of firm-specific human capital could depend on the development level of the industry. This paper focuses on a particular industry and examines how firm-specific human capital becomes important when we consider the difference in quality of goods produced by firms. Players improve their performance depending on their tenure in the team, because their team-specific human capital will accumulate over time. However, the team-specific human capital of a player in a team is useless for other teams. A player’s performance will reduce once he changes his team. However, no study has so far considered the following dynamics. When team members gradually changed, the value of the players’ team-specific human capital reduced, because cooperation and mutual trust between players is critical to realize the team strategy. A player’s performance could possibly reduce if he stayed in the team for too long.====In the Japan Professional Baseball League (JPBL), players were required to acquire only general skills in any team, because team-specific skills are unlikely to exist (e.g., Ohtake and Ohkusa, 1994; Ohkusa and Ohtake, 1996). Unlike the Major Baseball League (MLB) in the United States, the JPBL follows almost the same strategy for all teams (Ohtake and Ohkusa, 1994)==== . We can consider the difference between MLB and JPBL as follows. Compared to the United States, Japan has a more homogenous society. Therefore, unlike the MLB teams, JPBL teams share similar strategies and skills. Second, JPBL is at a lower level than the MLB. For lower-quality players in a less competitive situation, team-specific capital is less likely to contribute to win. However, in the 21 st century, a large number of Japanese players moved to the MLB and exhibited spectacular performance==== . Japanese players have improved significantly, and the JPBL has become more competitive than ever before. Increased competitive pressure in the market naturally made the teams to vary their strategy, leading to accumulated team-specific human capital.====The J-League was believed to experience similar conditional change due to transfer of skills from the more developed European leagues. The J-League is different from the JPBL in that they have a two-division system, with different teams playing for the first division (J1) and second division (J2)==== . The champion and second-placed teams in J2 can be promoted to J1. Top-class J-League players tend to play as members of the J1 teams, because the first division teams require players with higher performance than the J2 players. Accordingly, the J1 can be considered a more advanced league than the J2. Hence, it is plausible that specificity of skills is required in J1, but not in J2. We can examine whether the importance of firm-specific human capital depends on the developmental stage of professional sports by comparing the J1 and J2. Furthermore, various indices measure player performance. The level of player interdependence is critical, but varies by play. For instance, compared to “shoot,” the success of “pass” is more likely to depend on the players’ interdependence and the team-specific strategy. Hence, the success of shoot is unlikely to depend on firm-specific human capital even in J1==== . Using the individual-level panel data of the J-League, this paper examines how the matching of players and teams depends on team-specific human capital by comparing the team-specific and general skills. Furthermore, we consider the effect of long-term deterioration of team-specific human capital. Our main findings are as follows. Increase in a player’s tenure in a team accumulates his team-specific human capital and therefore improves the team performance in J1, but not in J2. However, from a more long-term viewpoint, the benefit of staying in a team disappears after 4 years from the rookie year. On the other hand, in J2, experience in the J-League is not an important determinant of player performance, because only players with talent to play in the J-League will survive.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

First, it is shown that, like in the case of manufacturing sector, a productivity sorting on the overseas activities is also present in the case of wholesalers. Namely, only the most productive wholesaler firms can engage in foreign direct investment, and the next productive wholesaler firms can participate in export activities, and the least productive wholesaler firms do domestic transactions only. Second, we investigate how the wholesalers facilitate manufacturers’ export activities in the form of indirect exports. We have found that the wholesalers through which manufacturing firms indirectly export their goods are predominantly located in Tokyo or Osaka. The probability of indirect exports is negatively correlated with distance between manufacturers and wholesalers, but there are certain threshold distances at 300–500 kilometers, over which the chance of indirect exports turns null. Another notable finding is that wholesalers’ productivities have positive correlation with the chances of indirect exports whereas manufacturers’ productivities do not matter. The number of manufacturers from which a wholesaler purchases goods, is found to have a positive correlation with the probability of indirect exports, a type of economies of scope effect.","Revival of regional economies is one of the core policy objectives of the Japanese government as in many countries, especially developed nations. An acute problem Japan faces is the population aging and subsequent shrink of the economy. The problem is particularly eminent for regional economies, which are suffering both from low fertility rate and de-location of youngsters from local areas to cities. As one of the strategies to reinvigorate regional economies, the Japanese government aims to expand its economic relations with steadily growing Asian economies, especially China and the South East Asian economies.====It is widely known that wholesalers play important role in economic activities (see, for example, Ahn et al. (2011); Bernard et al. (2010), or Crozet et al. (2013). It is especially the case in Japan, where general trading houses (Sogo Shosha) are involved in many business transactions. Despite these circumstances, the role of wholesalers in manufacturers’ overseas sales is not sufficiently known. This paper aims to investigate the role of wholesalers for the economic activities, especially focusing on their roles on indirect exports of manufacturers in regional economies. To be more specific, first, it studies whether wholesalers and/or manufacturers’ productivities are important determinants of indirect exports. Second, it analyses whether there are certain levels of threshold distance for the relation between manufacturers and wholesalers, which is an especially important issue when we think about regional economies. Third, we investigate on the economies of scope effect. Wholesalers export many kind of goods from many producers, thus are able to spread the fixed cost of exports, as a result, facilitating manufacturers’ indirect exports (Akerman (2018)).","Wholesalers, indirect exports, geography, and economies of scope: Evidence from firm transaction data in Japan",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142521000037,24 January 2021,2021,Research Article,55.0

By examining changes in the composition of employment, we measured ==== and destruction at the division level and explored whether robotics technology, as a leading example of automation, not only displaces workers but also introduces new jobs in favor of labor. We made use of unique, division-level employment data for Japan’s manufacturing firms, together with industry-level data on the installation of industrial robots. We found that industry-level adoption of robots positively affects the firm-level job creation rate and the job destruction rate. Because the magnitude of the impact is larger for job destruction, robot adoption has an overall negative impact on firms’ net employment growth. Our findings suggest that the labor displacement effect of robotics technology and the emergence of new jobs due to technological change coexist even at the firm level.","Many industries are currently on the verge of a second digital revolution known as the fourth industrial revolution (Makridakis, 2017). In the face of challenges arising from aging societies and labor shortages, especially in advanced economies, industrial digitalization, robotics technology, and artificial intelligence (AI) will play a significant role in helping countries go through the transition. Fig. 1 shows a clear trend of growing installation of industrial robots, together with a downward trend of the working population ratio in Japan. The greater utilization of robotics technology seems inevitable in Japan and in other highly mature economies.====The adoption of industrial robots, or automation in general, can help Japan’s industries ease the burden due to the labor shortage; however, accelerated automation of the tasks that used to be performed by labor raises concerns that new technologies will make the existing labor redundant (e.g., Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014; Akst, 2013; Autor, 2015). The main reason for concern is the replacement of humans by machines and other technologies to perform certain types of jobs. Technology could make the production process more capital-intensive by automating labor-intensive tasks. For example, the loss of comparative advantage conferred by cheap labor might result in concentrated production tasks in advanced economies. Therefore, developing economies that specialize in labor-intensive parts of the global supply chains worry about the possibility that jobs might evaporate in their territories.====If we go a step further and examine within-firm labor structures, the situation is even more complicated. Manufacturing firms usually have different divisions with various functions: sales, marketing, production, research and development (R&D), administration, amongst others. In some divisions, such as R&D, it is common practice for firms to hire the most talented workers, while in production or assembly divisions, firms tend to recruit less skilled workers. In other divisions, workers with different skill levels are mixed. Since routine tasks are more likely to be automated, divisions that focus on routine tasks are more prone to experience job loss. Meanwhile, technological changes associated with automation may yield new job opportunities or new tasks that can be performed by skilled workers.====Most previous studies have tended to look at the net employment growth of firms and have overlooked within-firm labor dynamics driven by automation. Since net employment change is the difference between total job creation and job destruction within a firm, detecting the net or overall impact does not necessarily mean that job creation and job destruction occur in the same directions and magnitudes. Thus, the conventional arguments about complementarity between skilled labor and automation and about substitutability between unskilled labor and automation cannot be simply applied if we look only at overall employment changes. This study addressed this gap by separating job creation from job destruction and investigating whether robotics technology, as a leading example of automation, affects them in different ways.====Unlike previous studies, this study defined job creation as the aggregated number of newly added jobs for all divisions within a firm and job destruction as the aggregated number of newly eliminated jobs for all divisions. One obvious advantage of such definitions is that the individual effects of robotics technology on job creation and destruction can be captured separately, which helps to elucidate a firm’s decision-making from different perspectives.====The next section reviews related studies. Section 3 describes the data used for assessment of firm-level employment composition and industry-level robot installation. The estimation strategy used is described in Section 4.

However, due to the inevitable publication delays of some key economic data, such as GDP, policy makers are forced to set policies without knowing the current state, and sometimes, even without knowing the past state, of the economy.====Nowcasting, the prediction of the current state of the economy, consequently has a growing body of literature around it. Although GDP is compiled mostly at a quarterly frequency and released with a lag, many business cycle indicators are timelier and more available at higher frequencies; e.g., monthly industrial production data, high-frequency financial data, or big-data obtained from internet/electronic transactions. Economists want to exploit such data in the most efficient way to monitor current state of economy in a timely manner. On the policy-making front, some central banks utilize nowcasting as a method of capturing current economic conditions in a timely fashion. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (NY Fed) and The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (Atlanta Fed) release the nowcast of US GDP growth regularly.==== Bank of England (BOE) reports the nowcast of GDP in the Inflation Report.==== In addition, Norges Bank regularly releases short-term forecasts for GDP growth rates and inflation rates produced by the system for averaging models (Aastveit et al., 2011).====In this paper, we discuss the usefulness of mixed-frequency approaches to nowcasting quarterly GDP growth rates using Japanese data. To effectively utilize timely indicators which are available monthly, ranging from hard data (e.g., industrial production index) to soft data (business surveys), we employ mixed frequency approaches, Mixed-Data Sampling (MIDAS) and bridge equation approach. In doing so, we also examine factor models that utilize a novel sparse principal component approach, and also examine combination of models and professional forecasts.====Our findings are outlined as follows. First, in nowcasting the quarterly GDP growth rates, we find that out-of-sample forecasts produced by the employed models, namely MIDAS and bridge equation models, outperform those of an in-sample mean benchmark.==== In addition, we find that there is a gain from employing a sparse principal component approach in extracting factors. Furthermore, we find that some of the forecast combinations that combine model forecasts and survey forecasts improve predictive power.====This paper employs Japanese data instead of US data. The empirical success of mixed-frequency models and forecast combination schemes in nowcasting US GDP raise the question of whether such a procedure works well in other countries. In this regard, the research on nowcasting Japan’s GDP is still scarce, despite the fact that Japan is the third largest economy and the second largest advanced economy. As for the previous studies, Hara and Yamane (2013); Urasawa (2014), and Bragoli (2017) develop short-term forecasting models to conduct GDP forecasts for Japan and assess performance.==== These papers show that the forecasts generated by the proposed models are comparable with or outperform simple univariate models/professional forecasts.

Using firm-level data from Japan, a country with an aging population, we find the following results. First, smaller, younger, highly leveraged, and nongrowing firms are likely to have no successor. Second, firms with an elderly manager are more likely to exit and default if they have no successors, and this is particularly the case during the global financial crisis around 2009. This result suggests that these firms have less incentive to repay debts because they are not going concerns. As a result of the high probability of default, the annual change in bank borrowing is low if firms with an elderly manager have no successor. Third, the annual change of bank borrowing is lower for firms with no successor during the crisis and post-crisis periods, implying that banks reduce lending to these firms because of their high risk.","We investigate the empirical relationships between the lack of a successor for a small business and firm default, borrowing, and performance using firm-level data from Japan. Japan is an aging country and, indeed, many developed countries have increasingly elderly populations. In line with the increasing age profile, small business managers in Japan are becoming older. Their average age in 2009 was 59.57 years, but this had increased to 61.73 years by 2018.==== ==== According to the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency’s ====, on average, small business managers retire when they are around 68 or 69 years old. As they become older (over 60 years), these managers need to consider the succession of their firms in the near future. Many small businesses face difficulties in finding successors and are unable to replace their elderly managers with younger managers. As a result of the lack of successors, the elderly small business managers must continue to work despite their increasing age.====Many studies (e.g., Bertrand and Schoar, 2006) illustrate the importance of succession in the life cycle of a firm. Moreover, as the manager’s abilities have a particularly large effect in the case of small firms, the succession of small business managers has a particularly significant impact on the activities and performance of such businesses. Numerous previous studies (e.g., Kaplan and Minton, 1994, Kang and Shivdasani, 1995) have investigated the determinants of chief executive officer (CEO) turnover in listed firms and found a relationship with firm performance. Some studies have focused on family businesses and investigated the performance of firms after the succession and turnover of a manager (Smith and Amoako-Adu, 1999, Huson et al., 2004, Péz-González, 2006, Bennedsen et al., 2007, Chung and Luo, 2013). Saito (2008) and Mehrotra et al. (2013) investigated the heterogeneous effects of succession using data on Japanese listed firms, categorized by the types of descendants or successors. Using a sample of listed firms, Tao and Zhao (2019) showed that firms with relay succession enjoy higher profitability and stock returns and lower volatility after turnovers. Focusing on small businesses, Diwisch et al., 2009, Uesugi and Saito, 2009, and Tsuruta (2020) investigated the effects of succession on firm performance and growth using firm-level data. Diwisch et al. (2009) focused on the effects not only of actual succession, but also of succession plans on firm growth.====In this paper, we focus on whether a successor has been appointed prior to the actual succession in small businesses with an elderly manager. We investigate the effects of the existence or lack of such a successor while the small business still has its elderly manager rather than the effects of the actual succession. This research question is important in relation to small businesses. According to the World Bank, 27.05% of Japan’s population is aged 65 years and older, compared with 16.81% of the population in the OECD countries.==== ==== In both Japan and the OECD countries, these percentages are increasing. We predict that an increasing number of countries will face Japan’s situation of increasingly older small business managers and that the effects of the lack of a successor on small business management will become an important issue in many countries. As Japan is the most rapidly aging country worldwide, we can investigate this issue by utilizing the large amount of available data on small businesses with an elderly manager.====Even when elderly managers remain in their positions, the lack of successors may have effects on the firms’ default probability, borrowing, and performance. First, the lack of a successor has significant effects on the financial activities of small businesses with an elderly manager. According to Petersen and Rajan (1994), close lending relationships between banks and small business borrowers enable the borrowers to transfer information to the banks and mitigate information gaps. As Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) argued, the threat that borrower–lender relationships will end diminishes the moral hazard problem in the case of small businesses. Borrowers do not select risky investments because the banks will not offer credit to defaulting firms. If they terminate their relationships with banks, small businesses cannot obtain sufficient funds, even when they have profitable investment opportunities. Furthermore, borrowers make efforts to repay debts to avoid the termination of their lending relationship.====However, if there is a high probability that a firm will exit from a market because its elderly manager lacks a successor, then the threat of termination of the bank–borrower relationship will not be sufficient to prevent moral hazard. We predict that the lack of a successor will have significantly positive effects on exit from the market, in the sense that it will significantly increase the probability of a firm exiting from the market. The lack of a successor also significantly increases the probability of default because these firms have less incentive to repay debts, which causes a moral hazard problem. In addition, as credit risk is high for firms with no successors, banks reduce credit supply to these firms.====Second, the relationship between firm performance and the lack of a successor can be negative. If the credit constraint caused by the lack of a successor is severe, firms without successors cannot finance investment opportunities, even if they have projects with positive net present values. This suggests that the level of investment is lower for firms with no successor. Additionally, if there are no successors, the probability that these small firms will exit the market is high. In this case, there can be significant “shadow of death” effects. Griliches and Regev (1995) used this term to describe the effects of impending exit on the performance of firms. They found that the performance of firms that will exit from a market in the future is lower in the year before their exit compared with the performance of surviving firms.==== ==== Therefore, we predict that the performance and growth of firms without a successor are lower than those of firms with a successor if credit constraints and shadow of death effects are severe.====As we have noted above, many existing studies (e.g., Diwisch et al., 2009, Uesugi and Saito, 2009, Tsuruta, 2020) have investigated the effects of actual succession, but few have investigated the effects of the existence of a successor prior to succession on small businesses. Further, many of the existing studies focused only on the effects on firm performance, whereas we include the effects on financial activities and default, which are not adequately investigated in the literature.====Using data involving almost 1 million observations of small businesses with elderly managers (aged 60 years and older) in Japan, we find the following results. First, smaller, younger, highly leveraged, and nongrowing firms are likely to have no successor. This implies that financially and economically distressed firms are less likely to have a successor. Second, the probabilities of exit and default are higher for firms with no successor than for firms with a successor after controlling for proxies of firm risk and firm characteristics, as well as for year, industry, and region effects. These effects are larger during the global financial crisis around 2009. These results imply that firms with no successor have less incentive to avoid firm exit and default, especially during an adverse shock. As these firms are not going concerns, the probability of repaying debts is low.====Third, the annual change of bank borrowing is lower for firms with no successor during the shock and postshock periods (from 2007 onwards). The estimated results for default suggest that firms with no successor are more likely to default, and that they are riskier firms than those with a successor. Therefore, banks reduce lending to these firms. These results are supported if we use a propensity score matching method to conduct the estimations. Fourth, using a simple fixed-effects estimation, we show that having no successor has positive effects for sales growth and return on assets (ROA), but the positive effects are weaker during the shock and postshock periods. However, these estimation results face issues of endogeneity, which are sample selection and simultaneity. To mitigate these issues, we use a propensity score matching method, which shows that the sales growth of firms with an elderly manager is lower if they have no successor. These effects are larger during the shock period, which supports the hypothesis that firms with no successor are lower performing than other firms if we mitigate the endogeneity issues.====Our paper has some implications for the negative effects of a sudden economic shock, such as the ongoing economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which began in 2020. The Japanese evidence suggests that the credit risk for small businesses without a successor will worsen in the near future, as it did during the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the exit rates for these firms are likely to increase.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data set. We present the estimation results for the determinants of the existence or lack of a successor in Section 3. In Section 4, we introduce our empirical strategy for estimating the effects of the existence or lack of a successor and discuss these results. Section 5 concludes the paper.","Lack of successors, firm default, and the performance of small businesses",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142520300517,17 December 2020,2020,Research Article,58.0

In addition, it investigates whether appropriate components of the value function and the probability weighting function that capitalize on prospect theory value are different across countries due to the different risk attitudes of investors. The parameter estimates show that each stock market has different cumulative prospect theory parameters for better performance, and the level of loss aversion for each market is lower than the original values offered by Tversky and Kahneman (1992).","Barberis et al. (BMW; 2016) show that a stock whose past return distribution has a high (low) prospect theory value earns a low (high) subsequent return in the U.S. stock market. The prominent explanation of the prospect theory is that individuals deviate from standard utility theory when they evaluate risk by considering individuals who prefer skewness or lottery-like features in asset return distributions. Tversky and Kahneman (1992) provide detailed formulas that specify the value that prospect theory assigns to any given distribution of gains and losses.====The prospect theory suggested by Tversky and Kahneman (1992) has two types of functions as follows: S-shaped value function and probability weighting function. The S-shaped value function is concave over gains and convex over losses and steeper in the loss domain and thus consistent with investors’ loss aversion.==== The other function is the probability weighting function that reflects investors’ tendency to overweight both tails of return distribution. Tversky and Kahneman (1992) insist that overweighting is more pronounced for positive outcomes. Actually, prospect theory consists of the following three components, namely, curvature of concavity/convexity; loss aversion; and probability weighting. Each component has its own parameter(s).====An important prediction of theoretical models that reflect investors’ tendency to overweight the low probability of a large payoff is that securities with lottery-like features can become overpriced relative to the values implied by standard investor preferences (e.g., Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005; Brunnermeier et al., 2007; Mitton and Vorkink, 2007). Barberis and Huang (2008) argue that a positively skewed security can be overpriced and then earn a negative average excess return. Bali et al. (2011) show there is a significant negative relationship between stocks’ maximum daily returns in a month and their returns in the subsequent month. These newer models including Tversky and Kahneman’s (1992) cumulative prospect theory that depart from the standard expected utility framework consider those investors who prefer skewness or lottery-like features in asset return distributions, and how these preferences can inﬂuence asset prices in equilibrium. Mitton and Vorkink (2007) find that a heterogeneous preference for skewness allows investors to underdiversify. The stocks most often selected by underdiversified investors have substantially higher average skewness than do those selected by diversified investors. These models posit that positive skewness is overpriced because investors optimally choose to underdiversify.====Moreover, recent studies have indicated that the general degree of loss aversion is lower than the original estimates assumed by Tversky and Kahneman (1992). Barberis et al. (2019) argue that the original cumulative prospect theory parameters are almost 30 years old and are also based on only a small number of participants. Recent studies, such as those by Walasek et al. (2018) and Chapman et al. (2018), show that the true level of loss aversion is significantly lower than the widely accepted level of loss aversion. In their study on risk attitudes using the prospect theory framework, Rieger et al. (2015) show that there are substantial cross-country differences in risk preferences that depend on both economic and cultural factors. Still, none of the previous studies have investigated the effects of country-specific parameters on stock market performance.====Thus, this study posits that investors’ diverse attitudes toward risk over positive and negative prospects may be somewhat different from country to country, particularly in the Asian stock markets. What are the components of value function and probability weighting function that better reﬂect the prospect theory values that make these stocks appealing to investors? Is the form of the value and weighting functions the same for all stock markets or different?====Motivated by investors’ diverse attitudes toward risk over positive and negative prospects and differently overweighting the tails of return distribution, this study investigates two issues. First, this study investigates whether BMW’s (2016) empirical results hold for the Asian developed stock markets (i.e., Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore). They show that prospect theory value plays an important role as a sentiment not only in the U.S. stock market but also in the broad international stock markets. However, they do not provide any detailed empirical results for each country. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to provide more detailed evidence on prospect theory for the Asian stock markets.==== Do investors in the Asian developed markets overpay lottery-like stocks, i.e., stocks that have a relatively small probability of a large payoff? Investigating investors’ trading behaviors in the Asian developed stock markets that are fundamentally different in investment sentiment, stock market structure, economic growth and ﬁnancial openness offers further evidence on the nature of the prospect theory.====Second, this study attempts to determine the out appropriate components of value and weighting functions for prospect theory to be able to improve stock return forecasts and capitalize on the theory value for each stock market. We presume that appropriate components for better performance may be different across countries due to the different risk attitude of investors. By modifying the parameter(s) of each component, this study explores the country-specific values of parameters that capitalize on the prospect theory value and thereby are able to produce better performance.====The rest of this study is organized as follows. In the next section the study presents conceptual framework and the model that formalizes our main empirical prediction. Section 3 reports on data sources and summary statistics. Section 4 presents evidence on prospect theory for the Asian developed stock markets and explores the country-specific values of parameters that can enhance the ability to predict stock returns and produce better performance.

To do so, we use ==== models which impose sign restrictions on impulse responses to identify monetary policy shocks. We find that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to significant exchange rate appreciation in Malaysia, the People’s Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea. However, in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, we find either a significant depreciation or no significant effect. These results suggest that an interest rate increase (or decrease) may not necessarily shield Asian countries from exchange rate depreciation (or appreciation) pressure following a U.S. interest rate increase (or decrease).","The U.S. interest rate increases prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 had caused concerns in many Asian countries. Prolonged US monetary expansion since the global financial crisis contributed to huge capital flows into Asian countries. As the U.S. economy recovered from the crisis, the Federal Reserve began to normalize monetary policy. Higher U.S. interest rates caused widespread expectations of capital flow reversals and exchange rate depreciation in Asian countries. Rapid exchange rate depreciation can increase the risks of a currency crisis. Many Asian central banks responded to the Fed’s monetary normalization by increasing their own interest rates to reduce the risk of financial instability.====Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, the Fed was poised to change course and cut the interest rate since the US economy began signs of slowing down. The prospect of the Fed’s interest rate cuts raised concerns in Asian countries. More specifically, lower U.S. interest rates may lead to currency appreciation in Asian countries, harming their international competitiveness. Such concerns may induce Asian countries to cut their own interest rates.====Against this backdrop, we investigate the effects of (domestic) monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate of Asian countries and try to shed light on the following questions. What are the effects of monetary contraction (or expansion) of Asian countries on their exchange rates? Does monetary contraction (or expansion) of Asian countries help stabilize their exchange rate against depreciation in the face of US interest rate increase (or decrease)?====Many past studies investigated the effects of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate. Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) investigated the effects of monetary policy shocks on U.S. exchange rates against each G-5 country. Like Sims (1980), they identified monetary policy shocks as innovations in the Federal Funds rate or the ratio of non-borrowed reserves to total reserves in recursive Vector Auto-regression (VAR) models. They found that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to exchange rate appreciation, consistently with most theories, but the maximum response of exchange rate occurs after a substantial delay of 2–4 years.====This result is inconsistent with the prediction of popular theories such as that of Dornbusch (1976). Dornbusch (1976) suggests that the short-run effect of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates exceeds the long run effect. In addition, they find that the maximum effect of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates occurs on impact. The finding of long delays in overshooting in Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) was named the “delayed overshooting puzzle” in subsequent studies. In addition to the “delayed overshooting puzzle”, Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) documented that the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition does not hold under monetary policy shocks. The deviation from the UIP condition is significant and persistent, contrary to the predictions of standard theory. This can be regarded as the “forward premium puzzle,” conditional on monetary policy shocks.====Following Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), Grilli and Roubini (1995) investigated the effects of monetary policy shocks in non-US G-7 countries on their exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. They identified monetary policy shocks as innovations in short-term interest rates in the recursive VAR model. They found that contractionary monetary policy shocks – i.e. interest rate hikes - lead to exchange rate depreciation in some countries. This finding is quite puzzling because standard theory predicts that contractionary monetary policy shocks will strengthen a currency. This finding is the “exchange rate puzzle.”====Although initial studies such as Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) and Grilli and Roubini (1995) documented various puzzling results, some subsequent studies on the effects of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates found more predictable results, especially for major industrial countries. Kim and Roubini (2000) (for non-U.S. G-7 countries) and Kim (2003) (for the U.S.) showed that those puzzles are weakened for major industrial countries. They allow contemporaneous interactions between the exchange rate and monetary policy by using non-recursive identification method. In particular, they fail to find evidence of exchange rate puzzle. In addition, the length of delay in overshooting is at most six months. That is, the delayed overshooting puzzle is weaker than in Eichenbaum and Evans (1995). Faust and Rogers (2003) also showed that a lot of uncertainty makes it difficult to confirm the existence of the various exchange rate puzzles in the U.S.====More recently, Scholl and Uhlig (2008) analyze a similar issue by using a VAR model that imposes sign restrictions to identify monetary policy shocks, as suggested by Uhlig (2005). Such an identification method has an advantage over other identification methods in that the method can avoid some pitfalls of past studies.==== Scholl and Uhlig (2008) found a severely delayed overshooting puzzle and the forward discount bias puzzle conditional on monetary policy shocks for the U.S.====However, subsequent studies such as Kim et al. (2017) (for the U.S.) and Kim and Lim (2018a) (for small open advanced economies) documented that the delayed overshooting puzzle is less pronounced. They use a smaller sample of more homogeneous monetary policy regimes and a VAR model that imposes sign restrictions to identify monetary policy shocks. On the other hand, Kim and Lim (2018b) investigated the issue for emerging countries and documented that the puzzles are more visible in emerging countries. For some countries, they found the exchange rate puzzle and a long delay in overshooting.====We investigate seven Asian countries, namely India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the People’s Republic of China, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand.==== We use the empirical model developed by Kim and Lim (2018a,b). Kim and Lim (2018a,b) developed the structural VAR model for small open economies that are appropriate for most Asian countries by imposing sign restrictions on impulse responses to identify monetary policy shocks. We consider the sample period after the Asian crisis because many countries changed their policy regimes after that crisis. Past studies such as Kim and Lim (2018a) and Kim et al. (2017) show the importance of using a sample of relatively homogeneous policy regimes.====We analyze the effects of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates in Asian countries by delving into the following issues. First, does a contractionary (or expansionary) monetary policy shock strengthen (or weaken) the exchange rate, in line with standard theory? Do we find the exchange rate puzzle? These are highly relevant questions for Asian countries, which place a high premium on export competitiveness. Will interest rate increase (or decrease) by Asian countries protect them from exchange rate depreciation (or appreciation) following a US interest rate increase (or decrease)? Second, what are the dynamic responses of exchanges rate to monetary policy shock? Do we observe immediate overshooting of the exchange rate as suggested by Dornbusch (1976)? When do we observe the maximum effect of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate? Do we observe the delayed overshooting puzzle? Third, what is the role of monetary policy shocks in explaining exchange rate fluctuations? Are monetary policy shocks significant sources of exchange rate fluctuations? Fourth, do we observe the forward discount bias puzzle, conditional on monetary policy shocks? Does the uncovered interest parity condition hold in the presence of monetary policy shocks?====In Section 2, we present the empirical model and data. In Section 3, we report and discuss the empirical results.

Ushijima Tatsuo,"Keio University Faculty of Business and Commerce, Mita 2-15-45, Minato-ku Tokyo 108-8345 Japan","Received 28 August 2020, Revised 2 November 2020, Accepted 5 November 2020, Available online 18 November 2020, Version of Record 25 November 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japwor.2020.101040,Cited by (2),This study provides evidence for the more-money and less-cash effects of diversification based on the industry-adjusted debt and cash holdings of Japanese firms. Diversified firms are more leveraged while holding less cash than focused firms in the same ,"A long-held view in finance suggests that industrial diversification increases a firm’s borrowing capacity because firms operating in multiple industries can use the cash flow generated by a business to fulfill the contractual obligations of other businesses (Lewellen, 1971). Stein (2003) coined the term “more-money effect” in describing the advantageous access of diversified firms to external capital enabled by such coinsurance.==== Consistent with this effect, recent research based on U.S. data indicates that diversified firms are significantly more leveraged than focused firms (Ahn aet al., 2006), while bearing lower loan rates (Aivazian et al., 2015). Research indicates that diversification also implies the less-cash effect. That is, diversified firms hold significantly less cash for precautionary motives than focused firms, especially when their businesses generate stronger coinsurance (Duchin, 2010; Subramaniam et al., 2011). Tong (2012) suggests that diversified firms hold less cash because they have better access to bank credit lines. Hann et al. (2013) find that, contrary to the conventional view in finance, coinsurance lowers the systematic risk, hence the cost of capital, of diversified firms.====These findings have important ramifications for various strands of research. However, whether they also hold for non-U.S. firms remains understudied in the current literature. This question is difficult to answer on a priori grounds. Any multi-business firm with imperfectly correlated cash flow streams can utilize coinsurance in servicing debt and funding investment. However, there is a large international difference in corporate risk-taking (John et al., 2008; Acharya et al., 2011). Risk-averse managers may adhere to conservative financing policies even when shareholder value maximization dictates they do otherwise (Lewellen, 2006). Particularly, managers are likely to have little incentive to increase leverage and reduce cash holdings if they have diversified their firms as a hedge against bankruptcy (unemployment) risks (Amihud and Lev, 1981).==== Depending on managerial risk propensity, the effect of firm scope on finance can therefore vary across economies and even across firms within an economy.====In this regard, Japan provides an interesting opportunity for further research. Japan and the U.S. are both home to many multi-business firms. However, corporate behavior in these economies is markedly different in some important respects. As emphasized by Jacoby (2004) and Hirota and Kawamura (2007) among others, Japanese firms are managed more conservatively than U.S. firms due to their emphasis on employment stability over shareholder value. John et al. (2008) find that, of firms domiciled in 39 countries they studied, U.S. firms are the most active in risk-taking and Japanese firms are the least. Fu and Ogura (2019) demonstrate that this difference in risk propensity does not disappear even when heterogeneity in firm size, age, and industry composition is considered. Hence, in learning about the effect of firm scope on finance, evidence from Japanese firms can complement existing evidence on U.S. firms. Accordingly, the present study investigates how diversification affects the leverage and cash holdings of Japanese firms and how these effects vary across firms with different risk propensities.====The sample consists of non-financial firms publicly traded between 2001 and 2012. When diversified firms are defined as firms with multiple 4-digit industrial segments, roughly 45 % of the sample firms are diversified. Consistent with the patterns observed for U.S. firms, diversified firms in Japan depend relatively more on debt than focused firms, while holding less cash. The median debt-to-asset (cash-to-asset) ratio is 26.0 % (9.9 %) for diversified firms and 12.7 % (15.0 %) for focused firms. These differences remain even when leverage and cash holdings are adjusted for the heterogeneous industry distributions of diversified and focused firms, and also when regressions are performed to control the standard determinants of capital structure. Our baseline estimations indicate that, ceteris paribus, the debt-to-asset (cash-to-asset) ratio of diversified firms is 6.4 (3.4) percentage points higher (lower) than that of median focused firms in the same industries. Regressions also reveal that diversification affects finance at the intensive as well as extensive margins. That is, among diversified firms, firms with wider industrial scope have higher leverage and lower cash holdings. These results are robust to the controls for unobserved firm heterogeneity and the endogeneity of firm scope.====Additionally, the current study provides some evidence that the effects of diversification on leverage and cash holdings decrease in magnitude when firms are owned more by stable shareholders who are friendly to incumbent managers and thereby insulate them from capital market pressures for risk-taking (Ikeda et al., 2018). In contrast, the effects become larger for firms owned more by institutional shareholders who seek higher returns as financial investors and actively contribute to corporate governance. These cross-sectional relationships suggest that, while Japanese firms adopt aggressive financing policies when they operate in multiple industries, the magnitude of this effect varies across firms depending on the risk-taking incentives of managers.====The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the data. Section 3 estimates the effects of firm scope on leverage and cash holdings. Section 4 examines the moderating roles of ownership structure.

Using Panel Data gathered in Iwanuma city, Japan, at two points in time (in 2010 before the quake, and in 2013 after the quake), we found that the high degree of housing damage negatively affected victims’ self rated health (SRH) (direct effect), and decreased the levels of their social connections, which in turn also had a harmful effect on their SRH (indirect effect). We also found that although the direct impacts of earthquakes disappear relatively quickly, the harmful indirect effects associated with a decrease in social connections are slower to dissipate. We conducted a first-difference two-step GMM estimation to consider the possible problem of endogeneity. The results support the above conclusion, and show that in the short-term, the indirect impacts of the earthquake accounted for 55 % of all the impacts experienced.","The Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred in March 2011 caused enormous damage. A Japanese National Police Agency report (2017) confirmed 15,894 deaths, 6152 injured, and 2562 people missing across twenty prefectures. People who were forced to change their residence because their homes had been burned or otherwise destroyed lost their connections with other people (Hikichi et al., 2017). Therefore, it can be concluded that the earthquake had both direct adverse health effects on its victims, and indirect negative effects due to reduced social connections (Hikichi et al., 2016a; 2016b). In this paper, by analyzing self-rated health (SRH) outcomes, we empirically investigate the Great East Japan Earthquake’s direct and indirect impacts on houses.====We found that a high degree of damage to houses negatively affected victims’ SRH (direct effect), and decreased the level of their social connections, which precipitated harmful effects on their SRH (indirect effect). In this paper, we use the term social connections (hereafter SC) as a concept related to social capital. It has also been shown that although the direct impacts of earthquake damage disappear relatively quickly, the indirect effects of a decrease in social connections remain for some time. In other words, the direct health effects caused by earthquakes resolve in the short term, but the earthquake’s negative aftereffects, which include a reduction in social connections, may continue to be felt for a relatively long period of time. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of the robustness of the results noted above. The robustness check shows that the results of the mediation analysis are established only within a fairly limited range. This means that the correlation between the SC and SRH error terms must be less than 0.068, in order to allege these results. This suggests the need to conduct further verification analysis using methods that will prove a causal relationship. We then performed an Instrumental Variable (IV) estimation, to verify the robustness of the assumptions that are necessary to assure the validity of the estimated results of the mediation analysis.====The extent to which the houses were destroyed is a natural type of experiment, and we may be able to regard the damage as a random event that occurred irrespective of the individuals’ attributes. However, as for SC, it may be difficult to accept these suppositions, because the following counter-arguments must also be considered: Firstly, there may be the opposite causality that you can interact with people because you are fine (a reverse causality problem). Second, there may be a correlationship between the ability to actively interact with people and the ability to be healthy, so these variables are correlated (an omitted variables problem). If such unobserved factors exit, false observation results are obtained.====In this paper, we use geographical information describing the area in Iwanuma City where the respondents lived before the earthquake. That is, the distance from the coast ≒ the magnitude of the effects of the tsunami is used as the principal instrumental variable. In addition, we also use the type of ownership (such as owned or rented) and the type of building (such as single-family or apartment) as instrumental variables. The results of the IV estimation show that there are larger mediation effects, and that in the short-term, the indirect impacts of the earthquake made up about 55 % of all the impacts. We also used these instrument variables to test whether the extent of housing damage and the SC variables are endogenous variables. The results show that the extent of housing damage is exogenous, and SC is endogenous to SRH.====In recent years, a large number of papers have examined the influences of social connections on health (Choi et al., 2014; De Silva et al., 2005; Gargiulo and Benassi, 1999; Lund et al., 2010). In particular, after Kawachi et al. (1997) showed that social connections are related to overall mortality, the relationship between high levels of social connections and good health outcomes has become the subject of intensive research. Social connections can be captured at the individual or regional level. In this paper, we focused on the individual’s level of social connections, mainly because we assessed the earthquake’s impact in a small area, Iwanuma city, which has an area of 60.45 km====.====It is difficult to enumerate all the studies that have been conducted on the relationship between social connections and health. This paper will introduce only Kawachi et al. (2008), who surveyed these studies. Several studies have examined the relationship between social connections and health in disaster situations. These include Ali et al. (2012); Beaudoin (2007, 2011), Beiser et al. (2010); Wind et al. (2011); Wind and Komproe (2012); Fergusson et al. (2014); Frankenberg et al. (2008); Kumar et al. (2007), and Van Griensven et al. (2006), but, with the exception of Fergusson et al., 2014 few studies have dealt with panel data gathered before and after the occurrence of natural disasters. In addition, Hikichi et al. (2016a, b), and Tsuboya et al. (2016) used the data analyzed in this study in a previous study. This article adopts an original approach by considering the broad concept of SRH as outcomes, an analysis that has not been conducted elsewhere.====In this study, we use subjective variables based on recollections to ask questions about changes in health conditions before and after the disaster. This step is often considered a weak point in the research process. However, in a study examining the quality of life (QOL) this point can be advantageous, because subjective variables evaluate their own health based on some criteria present in their own minds. This also applies to subjective variables such as life satisfaction. After experiencing a huge influence such as the Great East Japan Earthquake, the health conditions of the people in the respondents’ circle have often deteriorated. Based on such circumstances, the respondents’ subjective health levels will have great value, even if their health levels have not changed. Also, if they become more aware of the value of health, they will be biased to report that their health levels have increased. In other words, by changing the evaluation criteria, it becomes difficult to evaluate changes in subjective variables even within the same individual. When asking respondents to recollect changes before and after the disaster, we may be able to obtain more accurate information, since the evaluation criteria have not been changed.====Several studies on life satisfaction and happiness have reported that changes in these evaluation criteria actually occurred as a result of the impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake. Some papers report that this earthquake increased the level of happiness in Japan (Ishino et al., 2011; Yamamura et al., 2015), or at least no statistically significant nation-wide drop in happiness has been observed after the disaster (Tiefenbach and Kohlbacher, 2015). We think the reason these results were observed is that the logic described above is working, because there is little objective evidence that social and economic conditions improved after the earthquake. Unless the evaluation criteria are unified when subjective evaluations are made, an accurate analysis cannot be conducted. Research on anchoring vignettes is underway, as a means of dealing with these problems (Grol-Prokopczyk et al., 2011; Salomon et al., 2004).",On the direct and indirect effects of the Great East Japan earthquake on self rated health through social connections: Mediation analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142520300402,5 November 2020,2020,Research Article,68.0

We find as a result that firm-level import decisions explain a non-trivial fraction of the fluctuations in manufacturing aggregate productivity in Korea over the period between 2006 and 2012. Specifically, our estimation results show that Korean manufacturing aggregate TFP declined by 8.7% during the Global Financial Crisis, about one-third of which is attributable to a contraction in firm-level import intensity. The main findings of this paper suggest a possible link between the recent global slowdown in productivity and the slowdown in global trade.","Imports are productivity-enhancing but costly. Based on these two well-documented characteristics of imports, this paper aims to gauge the extent to which firm-level imports contribute to the aggregate productivity.====As for the productivity-enhancing nature of imports, there is a growing body of literature that identifies the positive impacts of imported inputs on productivity using micro data in a number of countries (Amiti and Konings, 2007, Halpern et al., 2015, Kasahara and Rodrigue, 2008, Topalova and Khandelwal, 2011, Goldberg et al., 2010).==== Behind such robust empirical evidence lie various theoretical channels through which imported inputs heighten productivity: learning from the superior foreign technologies embodied in the inputs, quality-ladder effects from higher quality imports, or variety effects from the enlarged sets of available inputs.==== Irrespective of the specific channels involved, as long as imports improve productivity, they can constitute one potential origin of aggregate productivity growth.====A more interesting question, however, is not whether but how much imports can explain aggregate productivity growth. This is so in particular because imports are costly in terms of a fixed entry cost, reflecting possible costs associated with searching and matching foreign suppliers, and thus only a subset of producers use imported inputs. To have a quantitatively significant impact on manufacturing aggregate-level productivity, therefore, the distribution of importers needs to be sufficiently skewed toward larger firms, which turns out to be mostly the case in many countries (e.g. Amiti et al., 2014, Bernard et al., 2009, Halpern et al., 2015, Manova and Zhang, 2009).====To examine how much of aggregate productivity growth can be explained by imports, we consider the case of Korea, a country that depends heavily on trade with shares of exports and imports relative to GDP of 49% and 46%, respectively, over the period from 2006 through 2013. The raw and intermediate goods that comprise over 90% of Korea's imports have mostly driven this pattern in recent years, as suggested in Fig. 1. To the extent that intermediate goods imports are concentrated in the manufacturing sector, which leads Korea's economic growth – with growth of 5.7% on average for the 2006–2013 period compared to the overall GDP growth rate of 3.7% – Korea's case should provide important implications concerning the link between imports and productivity.====Using Korean manufacturing firm-level data, this paper confirms at the firm level in Korea that both patterns described above hold: the use of imported inputs causes productivity to increase, and larger firms are more likely to use imported inputs. As a result, we find that firm-level import decisions explain a non-trivial fraction of the fluctuations in manufacturing aggregate productivity in Korea over the period between 2006 and 2012.====To this end, we take two main approaches. First, we closely follow the methodology developed in Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008), Halpern et al. (2011), and Halpern et al. (2015), who extend Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) by introducing the use of imported inputs as a specific source of total factor productivity (TFP), to thereby estimate TFP due to imported inputs separately from TFP from all other sources, while effectively controlling for the simultaneity and sample selection biases prevalent in a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) approach.====Next, we perform accounting exercises by employing a decomposition technique similar to those used in McMillan et al. (2014), Olley and Pakes (1996), and Pavcnik (2002). Once the firm-level productivity estimates are combined to the industry or aggregate levels with the firm-level market shares as weights, we break down the industry- or manufacturing aggregate-level TFP growth into the part due to the use of imported inputs and the part from all other sources, as a way of evaluating the contribution of imports to the fluctuations in TFP. We then take a further look at the sources of the fluctuations in import-related TFP, and confirm that they are driven mostly by changes in the import intensities at larger firms, which suggests the presence of an amplification channel through which the firm-level use of imported inputs translates to manufacturing aggregate productivity owing to the skewed distribution of importers toward larger firms.====Overall, the main contribution of the paper is to confirm and quantify a substantial role of importing on productivity growth in Korea by applying the accounting exercises whereby imported inputs are incorporated in the process of TFP estimation, while the aggregate TFP is decomposed into the part due to the use of imported inputs and the parts from all other sources. This adds to the existing studies on Korea that have emphasized the role of exporting on economic growth (e.g., Lechevalier et al., 2019, Lee et al., 2002), reconciling with the recent firm-level evidence that highlights the import channel of productivity gains from trade as discussed above.====The main findings of this paper suggest a possible link between the global slowdown in productivity (Eichengreen et al., 2017) and that in trade (Constantinescu et al., 2020), which have both been receiving great attention, separately, in recent policy discussions. A future study that quantifies the potential effect of the latter on the former via the imported inputs channel would be particularly relevant in this context. Our paper is also related to recent studies on the effects of import on domestic economies or the role of GVC in terms of import-export nexus using micro data in Asia countries. Although the focus is different from ours, Taniguchi (2019) finds that increased import from China had a positive effect on Japanese local labor markets by increasing local manufacturing employment growth and that this positive effect, contrast to the evidence of the U.S. in Autor et al. (2013), is attributable to an increase in intermediate imports from China to Japan. Hayakawa et al. (2020) finds that firms’ positive export-import nexus differs by type of trade agreement using firm-level data in Thailand, suggesting that firms engaged with GVC, both high import and export, tend to import more from MFN countries while firms targeting domestic markets import more from RTA countries.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the empirical strategy, and Section 3 introduces the data.

In particular, trilateral Korea-Japan-EU FTA with the reduction of both import tariffs and NTMs can give the larger increases in Korea, Japan and the EU’s GDPs, exports, and imports. Furthermore, the Korea-Japan-EU FTA also provides the positive welfare effects to all participating countries such as Korea, Japan the EU. And it can also contribute to increase the whole world’s welfare level. Thus, the Korea-Japan-EU FTA will be a win-win FTA strategy not only to Korea, Japan, and EU but also to the global world.","Since the Doha Round in 1990s became locked in a stalemate, the WTO contracting countries have focused to conclude bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs), instead of insisting on the GATT/WTO multilateral negotiation system. The European Union (EU), Korea and Japan have been main actors in negotiating FTAs or regional trade agreements (RTAs), because of their strong economic power. On the one hand, the EU recently concluded comprehensive trade agreements with Korea, Japan and other developed and developing countries as a vehicle not only to further activate economic relationships with these countries but also to promote world trade in accordance with European values and norms. On the other hand, South Korea and Japan have used FTAs to increase their export competitiveness since the 2000s.====The EU accounts for 30 % of the current global economy. In addition, the EU is the world’s largest economic region and has a significant influence on international trade. Exports and international trade are the major dynamic forces of economic growth in Korea and Japan. In recent years, the EU has become Korea’s second or third-largest trading partner, while Japan has become the EU’s sixth or eighth largest trading partner.====Korea has steadily expanded its free trade agreement (FTA) network since the Korea-Chile FTA in 2004. As of 2019, Korea has FTAs with more than 60 trading partners including the world’s top three economic blocs. The Korea-EU FTA negotiations were concluded in September 2007, and the agreement came into effect in July 2011.====Japan has also been a leading economy since the 1950s. The EU and Japan started negotiations for the FTA in 2013, and they finalized negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) in 2017. This EPA included not only a conventional FTA with the removal of import tariffs, but it also included a trade liberalization treaty including intellectual rights, service, and human development sectors between the EU and Japan. The EU-Japan EPA was finally implemented in 2019.====Accordingly, several pieces of research on the Korea-EU FTA have been carried out. To find out the effect of the Korea-EU FTA, Norsten and Burlutska (2012) analyzed interviews and trade statistic data from a Swedish company involved in the manufacturing industry. Yi (2015) examined the effects of the Korea-EU FTA on Korea’s trade and its implication.====Even though most studies were carried out before the implementation of the Korea-EU FTA and they predicted the effects of trade mainly by using computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, since the implementation of the Korea-EU FTA, there are few studies which analyze the effect that the FTA has on trade between Korea and the EU.====Lakatos and Nilsson (2017) analyzed the Korea-EU FTA. Ko (2014) analyzed the Korea-Japan-EU- FTA in service trade, and Song (2015) examined the economic effect of the Japan-EU FTA. Before the implementation of the Japan-EU EPA, Lee (2001) analyzed the Japan-Singapore FTA, and Ando and Urata (2007) analyzed the impacts of the East Asia FTA using a CGE model simulation. Nilsson (2018) examined the economic modeling of FTAs.====However, Berden and Francois (2015) argued that in the past 20 years there has been a relative shift in focus of trade negotiations from tariff reductions to the removal of NTMs. Berden and Francois (2015) quantified NTMs for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Ecorys (2009) also argued that Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) were more restrictive on US-EU trade and investment than tariffs; in particular, NTMs can be an important achievement of a trade liberalization deal. NTMs can be characterized as Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) provisions in regional trade agreements from the perspective of international law, standardization of the notification form, establishment of electronic notification system, enhancement of transparency by establishing inquiry points and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements.====To the best of our knowledge, no other studies have analyzed the economic effects of a reduction of NTMs associated with Korea, Japan, and the EU FTA. Thus, like most previous studies, this study analyzes the economic effects of the removal of import tariffs on the GDP and trade values of a country using CGE models. Then, unlike most previous studies, this study analyzes the economic effects of the reduction of NTMs on GDP and trade values using CGE models.====Therefore, this study analyzes not only the economic effects of the removal of import tariffs but also the economic effects of the reduction of NTMs on GDP and trade using CGE models.====First, this study sheds light on the economic impact of the Korea-Japan-EU FTA. This study analyzes how the removal of mutual import tariffs of a hypothetical trilateral Korea-Japan-EU FTA will affect the GDP, exports, and imports of Korea, Japan, and the EU using CGE models and some simulation scenarios.====Second, this study analyzes how a reduction of NTMs in Korea, Japan, and the EU will affect the GDP, exports, and imports of Korea, Japan, and the EU using CGE models and some simulation scenarios.====Third, this study analyzes how the removal of mutual import tariffs and a reduction of NTMs within the Korea-Japan-EU FTA will affect GDP, exports, and imports using CGE models and some simulation scenarios.====This research consists of the following. In part II, we review previous studies. In part III, we briefly review the annual trend of trade between Korea, Japan, and the EU. In part IV, this study introduces a simplified theoretical general equilibrium trade model.

There have also been episodes of rapid appreciation. For instance, during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Eurozone Crisis, ==== and other factors caused the Japanese yen to appreciate by more than 45 percent against the dollar between June 2007 and September 2012. These appreciations can squeeze profit margins if exporters must lower Japanese yen export prices to remain competitive. They may also reduce the volume of exports. How can Japanese firms weather large appreciations? How are they affected if exchange rates subsequently depreciate?====Producing differentiated products may help. Producers of commoditized products can face intense price competition, forcing firms to slash domestic currency export prices and compress profit margins when the exchange rate appreciates. Producers of differentiated products may not only be able to reduce domestic currency prices less during appreciations, they may be able to raise these prices more (price-to-market more) when the exchange rate depreciates (see ====).==== reported that, unlike for homogeneous goods, firms exporting differentiated products and firms having a large share of the global market tend to invoice in the exporter’s currency. They surveyed major Japanese exporters to investigate their invoicing decisions. Using probit estimation, they reported that firms are more likely to invoice in yen when they export through Japanese trading companies (====), when they conduct arm’s length sales, when they face higher hedging costs, and when their products are more differentiated and they have more market power. There are thus several factors that influence Japanese firms’ invoicing decisions.====This paper investigates whether Japanese transportation industry exports that are invoiced in yen – where yen invoicing for the transportation industry is informative of whether the product is more differentiated or commands a larger share of the global market – are less exposed to exchange rate changes. Focusing on the transportation industry rather than on all industries reduces variation across other dimensions that might affect pricing such as the skills and knowhow required to produce a certain good.==== The paper examines whether long run exchange rate pass-through is larger (and long run pricing-to-market, PTM, smaller) for goods that are invoiced in yen. The results indicate that, the more firms invoice a product in yen, the more they pass-through exchange rate appreciations into foreign prices. This suggests that firms producing differentiated products or firms possessing more of the market are better able to maintain profit margins in the face of yen appreciations.====The paper then examines ==== for the transportation industry. Sectors such as auto parts and motorcycles that pass-through large shares of yen appreciations also have low exchange rate elasticities. The finding that exports in these sectors are not sensitive to exchange rates implies that firms producing these goods have more freedom to raise foreign currency prices when the exchange rate appreciates.====Finally the paper investigates the exposure of Japanese stocks in the transportation industry to exchange rates. Finance models hold that stock prices are the expected present value of future cash flows, so they should reflect profitability. The results indicate that the firms that pass-through more of their exchange rate changes to export prices such as makers of commercial vehicles, trucks, and bicycle parts are also less exposed to exchange rate changes than firms that price-to-market.==== reported that even though the yen had less of an impact on export volumes after 2000, they substantially impacted the profitability of Japanese firms.==== investigated how external shocks affect the Japanese automobile industry. They estimated a monthly vector autoregression (VAR) over the 1980–2008 period. Their VAR included oil prices, the Japanese nominal effective exchange rate, measures of demand in the U.S. and the EU, real Japanese automobile exports, Japanese auto production, and industrial production. They assumed a recursive ordering to the variables and employed a Cholesky decomposition. They reported that over time positive shocks to U.S. demand increase Japanese automobile exports and positive exchange rate shocks (yen appreciations) reduce automobile exports. They also found that their model could not explain the huge fall in automobile exports during the GFC. They thus estimated another model using panel data on automobile production, sales, and inventories that are available by company and type of car. They reported a non-linear response, with Japanese automakers cutting production more quickly in response to accumulated inventories when output is falling rapidly than when output is falling slowly or rising.====This paper adds to the literature by using disaggregated data for the transportation industry. This allows us to investigate how similar products with different characteristics are affected by exchange rate changes.====The next section investigates the long run pass-through of exchange rates into export prices for goods in the transportation industry. Section ==== estimates exchange rate elasticities for these goods. Section ==== examines their exchange rate exposures.

We obtain better out-of-sample predictions of stock returns than in ==== for both the U.S. and Japanese stock markets. Our empirical results suggest that economic agents’ learning plays an important role in the dynamics of stock returns.","Attempts at predicting stock returns or equity premium have a long tradition in finance. The literature generally reports that, although stock returns are predictable in-sample, evidence of out-of-sample predictability appears to be much weaker.====Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) argue that these seemingly incompatible results can be reconciled if the assumption for a fixed steady-state mean of the economy is relaxed.====Focusing on the dividend-price ratio as a predictor for stock returns, they first document that the mean of the dividend-price ratio is not time-invariant. They then show that the in-sample forecasting relationship of mean-adjusted dividend-price ratios and future returns is statistically significant and stable over time. They note, however, that poor out-of-sample predictability is inevitable and results from the uncertainty associated with the magnitudes and, to a lesser degree, the timing of the breaks.====In their procedure for out-of-sample predictions, they assume that economic agents do not know either the dates of the structural breaks or the magnitudes of shifts. Meanwhile, they assume economic agents’ perception of the regime-specific mean for the dividend-price ratio to be time-invariant within a regime. However, as Evans and Honkapohja (2001) and Sargent (2002) suggest, in the presence of occasional structural breaks in the economy, economic agents will have to continuously relearn the new economy. Under this situation, they propose adopting constant-gain learning, in order to appropriately estimate economic agents’ perception of the changing economy.====Several empirical works on macroeconomics and international finance have used constant-gain learning. For example, Orphanides and Williams (2005) show that the stagflation of the 1970s can be better explained by constant-gain learning than by rational expectations. Mark (2009) employs learning in the exchange market, and shows that learning algorithms fit the data better than the rational expectations assumption. Branch and Evans (2006) demonstrate that the constant-gain learning algorithm serves as a plausible model of economic agents’ adaptive learning when forecasting inflation and GDP growth.====In this paper, we employ the constant-gain learning procedure in order to estimate economic agents’ perception of the mean of the dividend-price ratios that changes over time with structural breaks. We then use the dividend-price ratio adjusted for these estimates to obtain out-of-sample forecasts of stock returns.

The market prices of imported and domestic goods are almost always higher during the safeguard period compared with those in the previous year. However, the safeguard measure decreases the margins for imported goods, but does not affect the margins for domestic goods. As temporary import restrictions are expected to enable structural changes in the domestic ====, we also estimate the long-term effect on margins. We find that five years after the safeguard period, the margins remain similar for domestic goods and are smaller for imported goods. These results suggest that the temporary import restrictions were both harmful to imported goods producers and consumers and unbeneficial to domestic producers.","The World Trade Organization acknowledges that transparent and temporary trade restriction measures can be required to facilitate free-trade negotiations by easing pressure from imports competing with domestic industries. A safeguard is one such import restriction measure.==== If there is a rapid increase in imports that damages the domestic industry, temporary restrictions can be imposed as a form of safeguard. Not only are such policies important from a political perspective, their economic consequences are also of strong interest. Hence, evaluating the impact of temporary import restrictions is a key task. We examine a case in which the Japanese government imposed a provisional safeguard measure on Chinese vegetable imports in 2001.====The temporary import quotas limit the foreign supply; therefore, market prices will rise as a natural consequence. However, whether such changes affect imported goods or domestic goods, or both, is not obvious. Furthermore, because of the increased trade costs, the benefits for producers of increased prices may not be substantial. If trade restrictions do not raise domestic goods prices substantially and, thus, if the level of profits remains at the pretrade policy level, the purpose for which the policy was implemented will not be achieved. Hence, this study examines the level of margins before, during, and after the safeguard policy period and addresses whether import restrictions are beneficial for domestic (and foreign) suppliers.====The effectiveness of temporary trade restrictions also hinges on whether the import-competing sector is able to conduct structural changes; for example, if the sector can innovate to develop new products or to find a more efficient production process, a temporary safeguard measure may succeed in rescuing the domestic industry in a transparent way. One way of creating innovation is by building a brand. If the fact that goods are produced locally is attractive to consumers (e.g., as exemplified by a “local production for local consumption” slogan), then a temporary restriction can offer the industry a chance to build awareness of the benefits of the domestically produced goods. In the case of vegetable imports in Japan, there were concerns about the level of pesticides remaining in imported vegetables. These concerns offered domestic producers an effective way to boost the domestic industry by creating a reputation for domestic vegetables as being safer and fresher. To determine whether this occurred requires an empirical study of the safeguard. In this paper, using detailed domestic market data enables us to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the trade policy on domestic suppliers. This study contributes to the literature by showing how domestic market transactions changed in response to the safeguard and, in particular, how the profits reacted to the imposition of the safeguard in the long run.====We use domestic vegetable market data based on 55 geographically separated wholesale markets across Japan. Imported vegetables are also traded in wholesale markets. We empirically investigate market outcomes by using a hedonic price approach and demand function estimations. By using hedonic approaches, we investigate the price effect of trade policy in a difference-in-difference framework. This enables us to isolate the effect of trade policy on imported goods exclusively. Because market supply is limited, there may be spillover effects on domestic goods, which may disguise the impact on imported goods. In addition, it is important to observe the direct effect of trade policy and the changes in price caused by the import quota. Furthermore, by estimating hedonic price equations, the coefficients of the product characteristics are the shadow prices of the product attributes. This enables us to evaluate the changes in demand-side perceptions associated with the safeguard measure.====Then, we estimate a structural model to detect the margins that producers enjoy. We employ a demand estimation for differential goods and assume that the supply side involves monopolistic competition. As discussed later, the market for vegetables that we investigate is a differential good market and the number of producers is large, yet limited; therefore, suppliers have market power to some extent. These characteristics fit the properties of monopolistic competition. By obtaining demand elasticity, we can compute margins for each product. We analyze whether the margins change in association with the imposition of import quotas. We also estimate the same framework using data for the period five years after the end of the import restrictions. Whether the temporary restrictions successfully induced structural changes in the domestic industry can be determined by examining the margins; that is, if these were higher five years later, it would indicate that the import restrictions had positive effects on the profits of domestic producers in the long run.====We consider the case of Welsh onions (====), to which the provisional safeguard measure against China applied from April 23, 2001 to November 8, 2001. The data utilized are daily traded wholesale market data, which enables us to perform a detailed examination of the effect of the trade policy on domestic markets. The empirical results of the hedonic analysis show that the safeguard increased the market price for Welsh onions. Moreover, the price increases resulting from the safeguard influenced imported goods more than it influenced domestic goods. Hence, the higher prices were largely achieved for the imported goods. Then, our empirical analysis of the structural model demonstrates that the margins of imported goods are low during the safeguard period compared with pre- or postsafeguard periods, whereas the domestic margins are virtually the same for all periods. Hence, although consumers suffer from higher prices and foreign producers lose their higher margins, the import restriction does not provide benefits for domestic producers.====Considering the long-run effect, temporary import restrictions are expected to lead to structural changes, such as attempts by the domestic industry to build brand images that highlight the superiority of the domestic product. However, we find that the demand parameters did not change drastically five years after the provision of the safeguard. This suggests that the temporary import restrictions did not result in domestic producers taking advantage of the opportunity to gain a competitive edge.====The economic impacts of safeguards have been studied empirically in the literature. Several works confirm that safeguards have virtually no impact on domestic markets. For example, Kitano and Ohashi (2009) demonstrate that the US safeguard policy for motorcycles had little to do with the survival of Harley–Davidson in the US in the face of competition from imported motorcycles. Instead, the key factor was that there was low substitutability between Harley–Davidson and the imported motorcycles, such as Honda and Kawasaki. Hence, the safeguard policy itself had little impact on increasing Harley–Davidson's profits. Similarly, Chung et al. (2016) examine the effect of the US safeguard against Chinese tire imports and find no effect on the US labor market because, even though Chinese imports were restricted, there were increases in imports from other countries. While the presence of a third country may have important consequences for trade policy, this is not the case in relation to Japan's vegetable imports from China. Here, we can focus on the imports from China and still find no empirical evidence of successful temporary trade restrictions for domestic agricultural producers. Because under the WTO, approximately 21% of safeguards have been initiated in agricultural sectors (79 cases out of a total of 377), we contribute to the literature by assessing the effects of safeguard policy in this frequently used sector.",Do domestic producers benefit from safeguards?

Data focusing on materials for flexible display applications were collected from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Co-classification analysis was performed for the two countries’ technology networks. The processed data were then analyzed using cluster and concentration index analyses. Cluster analysis indicates that South Korea has a homogeneous technology field, whereas inter-field technology convergence is active in Japan. The concentration index analysis shows that South Korea focuses on specific technology fields, while Japan actively engages in distributed technology convergence. Thus, this study contributes to understanding technology convergence by clarifying how technology is connected and integrated by latecomer and leader country in the field of flexible display applications.","In the postwar period, Japan succeeded in economically catching up with developed countries such as the United Kingdom (Ikeda and Morita, 2020) due to rapid technological advancement based on its strengthening of specialized element technologies (Hayami and Ogasawara, 1999; Otsu, 2009; Ikeda and Morita, 2020). Japan’s success attracted considerable attention from latecomers such as South Korea (henceforth Korea). These latecomers benchmarked the Japanese case through studies to identify the factors driving successful catch-up (Hu, 2012; Hashino and Otsuka, 2013; Ikeda and Morita, 2020). However, despite the catch-up by latecomers, Japan still dominates the high-end market and is not affected by a weakening of price competitiveness or of investment due to exchange rates (Thorbecke, 2019). Although there are several literatures to explain the technology gap (Lastres, 1994; Hobday et al., 2004; Hashino and Otsuka, 2013; Chen and Chen, 2015), it is still unclear why latecomers are unable to supplant leader in the high-end market.====In this paper, we are interested in the phenomenon in which technology converges and evolves. In particular, technology convergence can be used as a mean by which technologies can be transferred from one field to another. This helps to understand the mechanism on how the technology competitiveness of one field can be migrated to another field to maintain competitiveness and a technology gap.====Technology convergence is the phenomenon of common technological innovation undertaken in different industries to overcome technical hurdles in various factory processes (Rosenberg, 1963); it is, thus, a critical driver of the transformation of industrial structures (Hacklin and Wallin, 2013; Karvonen and Kässi, 2013). Technology convergence occurs from key technologies, called technological knowledge intermediaries, at the boundaries between industries (Lim and Park, 2009). Technology convergence is important because advancements in technological knowledge intermediaries such as IT and new materials can disrupt existing industries and broadly affect other industries (Kim et al., 2014a,b; Choi et al., 2015). For example, innovative products such as smartphones were created through the convergence of various types of key information and communication technologies (ICT) (Kim and Hwang, 2012; Kim et al., 2014a,b). In addition, there have been cases in which the development of new materials (for example, ceramics) has been strategically promoted in Japan to strengthen industrial competitive power through convergence with new materials and other value-added products like sensor and electric components (Lastres, 1994). These not only blur the boundaries between technologies but also create new technologies and products that drive industrial growth (Curran and Leker, 2011). Therefore, understanding technology convergence has become important for industry growth (Hacklin and Wallin, 2013).====Owing to the increased interest, the number of academic studies on technology convergence has increased since the 2000s (Geum et al., 2012; Hacklin and Wallin, 2013). In addition, since technology development leads to technology convergence, which then leads to industrial growth, most East Asian governments have implemented support programs to promote technology development (Lall and Teubal, 1998; Lim and Park, 2009; Hacklin and Wallin, 2013). As such, the differences in technology convergence must be examined from the technology development perspective. However, there are limited cases where technology convergence is applied to the high-end of the market, such as materials (Geum et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014a,b; Choi et al., 2015) and comparative analyses between countries are even scarcer (Noh and Ji, 2019).====Therefore, this study proposes a publicly accessible patent-based approach to monitor and anticipate technology convergence (Lim and Park, 2009; Choi et al., 2015). Patents are used as indicators of the flow of technology to protect it from duplication over a given period of time, and are also sources of comparative advantage (Schankerman, 1998; Chang et al., 2012). Patent analysis can be thus used to quantitatively evaluate information such as the patent number, document type, title, inventor, International Patent Classification (IPC) code, application date, and is also the most efficient way to keep abreast of technology trends (Geum et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2015). Additionally, product innovation has a positive relationship with patents (Morikawa, 2019), and it has been found that innovative companies that evaluate patents as higher grades are more productive than other companies that do not (Hall and Sena, 2017).====Specifically, this study empirically analyzes technology convergence by analyzing the patents of two countries characterized by growth differences in a specific industry. We select materials for flexible display applications because these new technological applications are complex, unpredictable (Hu, 2012), and have a higher possibility of technology convergence (Chang et al., 2012). Although flexible displays have attracted attention for at least 50 years, they are currently becoming more popular because of the development of the display backbone technology (Allen, 2005). Flexible displays are therefore a new technology in the display industry (Wang and MacDiarmid, 2007) and are applied to high-end mobile phones and televisions.====Moreover, because of the lack of market or industry information about emerging sectors such as materials for flexible display applications, it is difficult to identify latecomer and leader countries. However, based on existing studies of display industry, it is reasonable to consider Korea as a latecomer country and Japan as a leader in the field of materials for flexible display applications (Sato, 2001; Zhang, 2003; Jang et al., 2009; Hu, 2012). In the display industry, Japan also caught up with advanced countries such as the United Kingdom (Thorbecke, 2019; Ikeda and Morita, 2020). However, after the successful catch-up, it found that materials are critical factors in the display industry, and it put forth effort to develop new materials (Lastres, 1994). Korea, by contrast, built its innovation capability by complementing the technology of Japanese companies and expanding its technological capacity (Hu, 2012). As a result, the downstream sector in the display industry is dominated by Korean companies, but Japan is positioned as a leader in the display upstream sector (Jang et al., 2009; Business Insider: Display Material Market, 2018).====To this end, a co-classification analysis using IPC codes was employed to examine technology convergence as an alternative approach to the previously used methods of co-invention and patent citation analysis (Ahuja, 2000; Ding et al., 2001). In addition, existing studies have investigated core technology (Zhang, 2003; Curran and Leker, 2011; Kim et al., 2014a,b) and focused on exploring important factors for technology convergence (Gauch and Blind, 2015). What it seems to lack in previous approach is to measure the extent to which how the technologies are interconnected. Therefore, this research address both static comparison and temporal dynamic analysis of how technologies are connected and integrated. This study also performs a cluster and concentration index analysis based on the analytical methods of Gauch and Blind (2015). This analysis compares the relationship structure and degree between the technologies in the two countries and identifies the theoretical and policy implications of the findings.====This study provides three contributions. First, it makes an empirical contribution to the analysis of technology convergence networks between latecomers and leaders, as there are few empirical studies on technology convergence based on materials and even fewer comparative analyses between countries. Second, the study makes an academic contribution to the precise analysis of technology convergence by targeting the field of flexible display applications. Specifically, unlike existing research that focuses on identifying core technologies, this study examines the technology convergence between leaders and latecomers by considering how core technologies are connected and integrated. Third, the study provides policy implications for latecomer countries benchmarking Japan in flexible display applications.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the background of the research topic by examining the growth patterns in the display industry among countries while also considering value chains. It also defines and measures technology convergence and patents. Section 3 describes the data collection and construction of the network, and Section 4 describes the methodology. Section 5 presents the results based on the research design in Section 4.

The basic equation in the analysis allows two distinct features that previous studies rarely explored. First, we allow the coefficient of initial per capita output to change when the growth rate of population is lower than a threshold value. Second, we allow the growth rate of population to have ambiguous effects on the growth rate of per capita output. Our estimation results confirm the convergence hypothesis in Japan. However, we find that the declining speed of convergence was more conspicuous in the regions that had negative population growth. We also find that the decline in population growth, which was irrelevant for regional economic growth before 1995, came to have harmful impacts on regional economic growth after 1995. We believe this occurred because in societies with declining populations, economies of agglomeration had more significantly disappeared in poorer regions than in richer regions.","In neoclassical economic growth theory, per capita incomes in poorer economies tend to grow at faster rates than those in richer economies. In particular, if economies are similar with respect to preferences and technology, all economies should eventually converge in terms of per capita income. In the literature, a number of studies confirmed the convergence hypothesis not only across countries but also across regions (see Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991) and Chapter 11 in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2003)). In particular, using similar approaches, a number of studies found significant regional convergence in Japan (see Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992); Kawagoe (1999); Shioji (2001a, b), Tsutsumi et al. (2009); Seya et al. (2012), and Shibamoto et al. (2016)). However, these analyses were based on a sample period when Japan experienced positive population growth. Thus, it is far from clear whether the results are still robust when the population growth rate turns negative. Japan experienced dramatic population growth for a half century after World War II. Its total population, which was 72 million in 1945, increased to 127 million in 2000. However, the population started to decline in 2008 and is expected to be 106 million by 2045. The population decline is more conspicuous in rural areas than in urban areas. Therefore, it is important to see whether convergence still occurs in the regions where population started to show a sharp decline.====Using regional data in Japan, the following analysis tests whether regional convergence still exists when population growth declined sharply in several regions. The regional data in Japan is an ideal data because population growth is highly heterogeneous across regions. As shown in Fig. 1, Japan consists of 47 prefectures. These prefectures are usually classified into eight regions: Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kinki, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Among the eight regions, the Kanto region where Tokyo is located is the most populated in Japan. Its population share was 33.8 % in 2015. Chubu and Kinki are also highly-populated regions. The population share was 16.9 % for the Chubu region and 17.7 % for the Kinki region in 2015. In contrast, Hokkaido, Tohoku, Chugoku, and Shikoku are less populated regions. The population share was only 4.2 % for the Hokkaido region, 7.1 % for the Tohoku region, 5.9 % for the Chugoku region, and 3.0 % for the Shikoku region in 2015.====The eight regions are heterogeneous not only in the level of population but also in the growth rate of population. Fig. 2 depicts how the population in each region changed from 1975 to 2015 and how it is expected to change from 2020 to 2030. To normalize population size, we set the value in 1975 to be 100. Since the Kanto region is highly populated, we divided it into North Kanto and South Kanto regions in the figure. In rural areas (e.g., Hokkaido, Tohoku, Shikoku, and Chugoku), population started to decline in the late 1980s and the speed of its decline is expected to accelerate during the next decade. In contrast, in the South Kanto region where the Tokyo Metropolitan Area is located, population is expected to grow until the early 2020s and remain high during the next decade. In the other urban areas (i.e., North Kanto, Chubu, and Kinki), population had grown until around 2010 and is expected to remain high until around 2020. The contrasting rates of population growth between rural and urban areas allow us to test how the different population growth affects the degree of regional convergence.====The basic equation we estimate in the following analysis is similar to an equation that has been widely estimated in previous studies such as Mankiw et al. (1992). However, our basic equation allows two distinct features that previous studies rarely explored. First, we allow that the coefficient of initial per capita output may change when the growth rate of population is lower than a threshold value. Second, we allow that the growth rate of population can have both positive and negative effects on the growth rate of per capita output. Our estimation results confirm the convergence hypothesis in Japan when we allow regional heterogeneity. However, we find that the speed of convergence declined more conspicuously in the regions that had negative population growth. We also find that the decline in population growth, which was less relevant for per capita income growth before 1995, came to have harmful impacts on per capita income growth after 1995. We discuss that this happened because in societies with declining populations, economies of agglomeration had disappeared in poorer regions more seriously than in richer regions.====In the literature, a number of studies explored how demographic changes affect economic growth. A growing literature focused on the potential costs of demographic change that may bring slow economic growth (e.g., Gordon, 2016) and other macroeconomic consequences such as an aggregate demand-induced secular stagnation (see the essays in Baldwin and Teulings, 2014 and Eggertsson et al., 2019). A related literature also explored the ﬁscal costs of demographic change for social security (e.g., Kotlikoff et al., 2002, and Attanasio et al., 2007). In contrast, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) pointed out that despite these concerns, there is no negative relationship between aging and GDP growth because of the eﬀ ;ects of aging on technology adoption. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) showed that the productivity implications of aging are ambiguous when technology responds to demographic change.====Using panel data for 142 countries, Lee and Shin (2019) found that population aging negatively affects economic growth only when it reaches a certain high level. Given its unprecedented speed and magnitude, it is likely that ongoing demographic aging in Japan has exceeded such a threshold level. A number of studies have supported the pessimistic view that population decline and aging have negative impacts on the Japanese economy. For example, Esteban-Pretel et al. (2017) investigated how demographic factors had negative effects on the Japanese labor market in the 1990s and the 2000s. Kitao and Mikoshiba (2020) quantified negative effects of demographic aging and changes in the labor market by using a dynamic general equilibrium model. Miyazawa and Yamada (2015) investigated the effects of population aging on Japan’s fiscal condition using a general equilibrium model with an overlapping generation structure.====However, few studies focused on the effects of demographic changes on regional economic growth in Japan. An exceptional study is Higa et al. (2019) that examined the drivers of domestic migration by using Japanese municipal-level migration and demographic data including the period of population decline. But they did not explore how the population growth affected regional convergence in Japan where population decline became conspicuous in several regions. Our main focus is new in that we explore the effects of demographic changes on regional convergence when population declined sharply in several regions.====This paper proceeds as follows. After constructing the model in Section 2, our empirical framework is explained in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 report our empirical results based on prefecture-level data. Section 6 reports our empirical results based on municipal-level data. Section 7 summarizes our main results and discusses their implications.",Regional convergence under declining population: The case of Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142520300025,3 July 2020,2020,Research Article,76.0

The sample period includes the era in which the government of Japan promoted a series of ==== reforms. A difference-in-differences analysis is implemented to eliminate the endogenous effects of a corporate acquisition. Choosing a control group by propensity score matching, we find that acquisitions have significantly negative effects on employment but no significant effects on labor productivity. For acquisitions by Japanese companies, we also find no significant improvement in ROA but significant improvement in Tobin’s q. The results are consistent with the zombie company theory, which indicates that an M&A prolongs the life of an insolvent company. Acquisitions by Japanese companies are in contrast with those by foreign companies, which have positive effects on ROA.","Recently, the topic of corporate governance has attracted special attention in the Japanese economy. Many suggest that strengthening corporate governance is indispensable in revitalizing Japanese companies.==== The purpose of this study is to explore how effective mergers and acquisitions (M&A) reinforce corporate governance in Japan. An M&A is one of the most effective ways to strengthen corporate governance because it controls the management of acquired firms through “disciplining” via equity holdings. Exploring how M&As change managerial behavior and affect corporate performance can provide essential guidance for corporate governance reform in Japan.====In the following analysis, we focus on M&As, which occur when acquiring entities gain 50% or more of a targeted company’s equity. Because majority voting rights control the ordinary resolutions of a general meeting of stockholders, the acquiring company, which is the new shareholder, can control day-to-day company operations and be deeply involved in company management. Therefore, M&A cases are natural experiments during which dramatic changes in governance are pronounced. We analyze corporate acquisitions performed in Japan from 2011 to 2017. A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis is implemented to explore how acquisitions impact employment, labor productivity, return on assets, and Tobin’s q in the acquired companies. We chose a control group by propensity score (PS) matching. The analysis allows us to identify the roles that M&As play in corporate governance without endogenous biases.====In the literature, two major hypotheses have been proposed regarding the effects of M&As on employment and labor productivity in acquired companies. The first is the value-creation theory, which posits that M&As improve efficiency in acquired companies, with shareholders and employees enjoying the added value obtained (Manne, 1965; Holmstrom, 1988; Conyon et al., 2004). In contemporary companies, in which ownership and management are separated, managers do not necessarily pursue efficient management to maximize corporate profits (Berle and Means, 1932; Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Jensen, 1986). Value-creation theory considers how M&As can rectify inefficient management and increase labor productivity by cutting unnecessary costs.====The second is the transfer theory (or value-redistribution theory), which posits that M&As spur the redistribution from workers to shareholders by reducing employment and wages (Schleifer and Summers, 1988; Blair, 1995). In transfer theory, M&As (especially hostile takeovers) are thought to increase the bargaining power of shareholders vis-à-vis workers. Thus, even if a target company’s productivity remains the same, an M&A may increase profits by reducing the workers’ share. If this theory is correct, employment reductions may be observed without labor productivity improvements after an M&A.====However, for M&As in Japan, we need to also examine the zombie company theory. A “zombie company” is a firm that is likely to fail but is deemed worthy of bailout or of having its life extended (Caballero et al., 2008). Studies often posit that zombie companies in Japan survive because of a bank’s evergreen lending or government assistance (e.g., Peek and Rosengren, 2005; Hoshi, 2006). However, M&As could also rescue insolvent companies and prolong their existence.====This study investigates which of the three theories is relevant in explaining the effects of M&As in Japan. Anecdotal evidence consistent with the value-creation theory includes the 1999 case of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., and the 2007 case of Tomy Company, Ltd. (Takara Tomy). In 1999, Nissan formed a capital alliance with Renault S.A., becoming a Renault affiliate. Carlos Ghosn, the Renault vice president at the time, carried out large reductions in employment and salaries at Nissan immediately after the alliance took place. Thereafter, however, a successful recovery in salaries and labor productivity occurred at Nissan. In 2007, Takara Tomy became involved in a strategic tie-up with the US private equity investment company Texas Pacific Group, Inc. At Takara Tomy, just as in the Nissan case, employee numbers and salaries dropped immediately after the agreement. However, this was followed by a recovery in salaries and labor productivity. Considering that labor productivity increased at both companies after an alliance, value creation is likely to have occurred with the large-scale employee cuts, followed by a substantial recovery of labor productivity.====However, it is far from clear whether we can generalize the anecdotal evidence for other M&A cases in Japan. Much of the empirical research on corporate governance in Japan is ambiguous about whether strengthening governance structures affects company performance. Tanaka (2014) finds that CEO ownership and family ownership are associated with high yield spreads but that firms with large corporate shareholders enjoy low yield spreads during the period 2005–2008. Using the sample of the period of corporate governance reform in the 2000s, Hasegawa et al. (2017) show that stock options did not function as a primary incentive for improving firm performance. Miyajima et al. (2018) examine the turnover of top executives in Japanese firms throughout the period 1990–2013 and find that performance indicators had shifted from return on assets (ROA) to return on equity (ROE) but that outside directors did not have any significant effect. Ikeda et al. (2018) show that managers who are subject to weak monitoring from shareholders avoid making difficult decisions such as large investments and business restructuring efforts. Fukuda et al. (2018) examine the effects of corporate governance on the performance of Japanese unlisted companies from 1997 to 2002 and find that biased governance works positively for companies with good performance but negatively for companies with poor performance.====However, studies do not present uniform findings regarding performance after M&As. Whether a formal change in governance structure can benefit Japanese companies is a topic worthy of thoughtful debate. This study uses corporate acquisition events involving “disciplining via stock,” especially those involving major changes in shareholder composition, to determine how the performance of target (acquired) companies is affected after their acquisition. More specifically, we analyze whether a buyout changes employment, labor productivity, ROA, and Tobin’s q.",The Effects of M&A on Corporate Performance in Japan:DID Analysis in the Era of Corporate Governance Reform,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142520300141,20 May 2020,2020,Research Article,77.0

This paper uses nationally representative panel surveys to examine the impact of poor childhood health on the future socioeconomic outcomes of the Japanese population. I find that poor childhood health adversely affects various future health conditions for the middle and long run, and that the effects on subjective and physical health are amplified with age. In addition, poor childhood health negatively affects promotion opportunities in the mid-term and labor participation over the long-term. Moreover, I find that low parental income directly and negatively affects subjective and psychological health. The empirical results imply that public policy for continuous good health in childhood improves future socioeconomic outcomes.","Numerous studies in developed and developing countries around the world have found that childhood health is strongly associated with future health and socioeconomic status via human capital development (Smith, 1999, 2007; Case et al., 2005; Currie, 2009; Almond and Currie, 2011; Cutler et al., 2012; Almond et al., 2018). In economics, there are two major frameworks to explain this relationship: the fetal-origin hypothesis and the life course model. The fetal-origin hypothesis focuses on the correlation between very early childhood health and future health and socioeconomic status. Related studies show that low educational outcomes and earned income are associated with exogenous health shocks in utero (Doblhammer, 2004; Almond and Mazumder, 2005; Almond, 2006; Cutler et al., 2007) and low birth weight (Conley and Bennett, 2000, 2001; Behrman and Rosenzweig, 2004; Almond et al., 2005; Black et al., 2007; Oreopoulos et al., 2008; Lin and Liu, 2009; Royer, 2009; Johnson and Schoeni, 2011; Baguet and Dumus, 2019). The life course model focuses on the effect of childhood or adolescent health on future socioeconomic status. Related studies show that poor physical and psychological health during childhood led to low educational outcomes, earned income, poor health, and premature death in adulthood (Miech et al., 1998; Case et al., 2002; McLeod and Kaiser, 2004; Almond and Mazumder, 2005; Currie and Stabile, 2006; Ding et al., 2006; Heckman et al., 2006; Currie et al., 2010; Baker and Stabile, 2012), which negatively affects labor supply and productivity (Heckman, 2007; Lundborg et al., 2014).====In Japan, only a few studies have explored this issue (Kohara and Ohtake, 2009; Nakamuro et al., 2013; Nozaki and Sano, 2016; Matsushima et al., 2018). Kohara and Ohtake (2009) use prefectural data and find positive correlations between birthweight and future academic achievement. Using their original cross-sectional Internet survey data of Japanese twins to control unobserved family backgrounds, Nakamuro et al. (2013) find that birth weight has a causal effect on academic achievement up to the age of 15 years but not for higher years of schooling and earnings. Using the ====, Nozaki and Sano (2016) find no significant relationship between low birth weight and educational achievement. Using the ====, Matsushita et al. (2018) found that low birth weight negatively affects various outcomes in early life, but do not affect educational attainment and primary job status.====However, the results of these studies based on the fetal-origin hypothesis may overestimate the effects of childhood health on future outcomes because they include not only the effect of low birthweight but also that of acquired poor health in childhood due to serious illness after birth. In this study, I conduct an empirical analysis based on the life course model using 9 years of nationally representative individual panel data from the ==== This analysis focuses on the effect of acquired childhood health on future outcomes, such as health, work conditions, and individual financial measures. Therefore, this study complements previous Japanese studies on this issue and the perspective is also very important for exploring the effective timing of health policy for health promotion during childhood including fetal life. Moreover, this study overcomes the analytical problems in previous Japanese studies as follows. First, by using 9 years of individual panel data, I can consider detailed individual heterogeneity, in contrast to Kohara and Ohtake (2009) using aggregated data. Second, I can also consider long-term time series heterogeneity, whereas Nakamuro et al. (2013) uses cross-sectional data and thus cannot consider the effect of changes over time in individual characteristics and of life events. In addition, Matsushima et al. (2018) uses individual panel data, but their sample is small and not representative as it only considers individuals from Sendai and Hiroshima cities. Moreover, as the data used in Nakamuro et al. (2013) and Matsushima et al. (2018) are from after 2011, their results included the effects of both childhood health and major exogenous economic shocks in the same period, such as the Great East Japan Earthquake (Higuchi et al., 2012). In addition, Nozaki and Sano (2016) uses nationally representative panel data, but their focus is only on the early adulthood outcomes of educational achievements. In addition, as far as I know, there is no study outside Japan that has examined the long-term effects of childhood health.====I find that poor childhood health adversely affects various future health conditions over the mid- and long-terms, and the effects on subjective and physical health are amplified with age. In addition, poor childhood health negatively affects promotion opportunities over the mid-term and labor participation over the long-term. The results also indicate that low parental income has a directly negative effect on subjective health over the mid- and long-terms and psychological health over the mid-term. In addition, poor childhood health caused by an incidental local catastrophic event negatively affects psychological health over the mid-term.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We use a panel of forty ==== that includes both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging markets economies (EMEs) to find that SOEs’ financial and economic activities exhibit relatively short-lived and robust reactions to risk aversion shocks, while responding smoothly and persistently to US policy uncertainty shocks, consistent with Bloom et al. (2018). A novel finding of this paper is that the responses of AEs and EMEs are asymmetric: AEs react more strongly to US policy uncertainty shocks while EMEs are more sensitive to risk aversion shocks. These results suggest that the channels through which each shock is transmitted to SOEs may vary.","In this paper, we investigate the spillovers of EPU shocks originating in the US, which is the largest economy in the world, to financial and macroeconomic fluctuations in SOEs. Apart from interest in the spillovers of US EPU per se, SOEs might be better subjects than large countries for studying the causal impacts of uncertainty shocks since the uncertainty shocks in large countries are exogenous, orthogonal to the fluctuations in the SOEs. In doing so, we explore the relative importance for SOEs of global risk aversion (or risk appetite) shocks in comparison to US EPU shocks.====Global risk aversion shocks have been found to be the one of the main drivers of economic fluctuations, especially in EMEs. A hike in global risk aversion can be transmitted to the financial markets of SOEs by modifying international investors’ risk-taking behavior and thereby affecting capital inflows into SOEs (e.g., flight to safety). At the same time, an increase in risk aversion it also broadens the country risk spread facing SOEs in international financial markets and, thus, adversely affects their real economic activities (see, for example, Rey (2015) and Akıncı (2013)). The role of US EPU shocks has been more prominent as a driver of fluctuations in the global economy, particularly in episodes related to the recent escalation in US-china trade tensions (IMF, 2013). Baker et al. (2016) and other recent studies demonstrate that such EPU shocks might be an important driver of business cycle fluctuations in the US. Beyond this domestic impact, policymakers and researchers in other countries, especially small open economies (SOEs), have been concerned about the financial and macroeconomic spill-overs of heightened EPU emanating from major economies since the dynamics of uncertainty in SOEs tend to be largely influenced by uncertainty shocks of a foreign origin, as illustrated by Bloom (2017). In addition to such direct uncertainty spill-over, US EPU shocks can be transmitted to SOEs through trade and financial channels (IMF, 2013). Besides the growing prominence of the two shocks, distinguishing the impacts of these shocks on SOEs is important for researchers and policymakers since they frequently occur simultaneously and are likely to have a different effect on SOEs.====Next, we compare the impacts of each shock on two different groups of SOEs: advanced economies (AEs) and emerging markets economies (EMEs), considering that each shock might have a differential impact on each group due to, for example, the difference in the extents to which US EPU spills over to domestic EPU in each SOE type, or the differences in financial development, and the degree of financial and trade linkages to the US between AEs and EMEs.====To this end, we estimate a quarterly panel VAR model using a dataset of forty SOEs, including 13 AEs and 27 EMEs, for the period 1990:Q1 to 2015:Q4. The model for estimation consists of two blocks—the US and SOE blocks—with the block exogeneity assumption that variables in the US block are exogenous to SOEs and thus cannot be affected by variables in the SOE block.==== Both global risk aversion and US EPU measures are included in the same model, not only to jointly investigate the relative role of each shock but also to allow for the interaction between EPU and financial market conditions in the US.==== Also, measures for the US business cycle and monetary policy stance are included in the US block to control for the endogenous responses of US EPU and her risk aversion to the state of the economy and changes in monetary policy.==== With these four variables in the US block, the identification of exogenous variations in global risk aversion and US EPU is based on a recursive assumption following the related literature such as Bekaert et al. (2013), and Popescu and Smets (2010) who study the relative roles of uncertainty shocks and financial shocks in German macroeconomic fluctuations. That is, in our baseline specification, the business cycle variable is ordered first, and the monetary policy variable is ordered second, followed by the risk aversion and EPU proxies. In the robustness checks, we consider an alternative ordering of the variables and find that our results are quite robust both quantitatively and qualitatively. In the SOE block, we include SOE variables related to capital flows, and real and financial market activities, considering the possible transmission channels of each shock to SOEs and data availability.====For a measure of US EPU, we employ the EPU index for the US constructed by Baker et al. (2016). For an indicator of global risk aversion, the US VIX index, which measures the option-implied expected volatility of the S&P 500 index over the following 30 days, has been widely used in financial markets and related literature. However, it also reflects financial market uncertainty and thereby might share a common uncertainty component with US EPU. To address this issue, we consider the risk-aversion index proposed by Bekaert et al. (2013) as our baseline measure of risk aversion while using the VIX index for robustness checks.====We have three main findings. First, both the US EPU and global risk aversion shocks have contractionary effects on real economic activity in SOEs, and also trigger capital outflows from SOEs, thereby exerting downward pressures on financial market variables such as equities prices and exchange rates.==== Second, global risk aversion shocks have stronger negative effects on both financial markets and real economic activities than do US EPU shocks in terms of impulse response and forecast error variance decomposition analyses. However, each shock exerts a qualitatively different impact on SOEs: the global risk aversion shock has more sharp and short-lived impacts both on financial markets and real economic activity, while the US EPU shock has smoother and more persistent impacts. That is, after a risk aversion shock, the sharp initial declines both in financial and macroeconomic activities are followed by a quick rebound and temporary overshoots within one year due to pent-up demand, while the gradual declines after a US EPU shock are followed by a sluggish recovery. These responses of SOEs to the external uncertainty shock resemble those that show up in Bloom et al. (2018), who showed that, in a general equilibrium framework, an uncertainty shock is followed by smoother and more persistent output responses along with a slower rebound compared to those shown as in Bloom (2009). Third, each shock has different effects on AEs and EMEs: AEs react more strongly to the US EPU shock and the EMEs to the global risk aversion shock. The findings that EMEs are more severely affected by the global risk aversion shock are similar to those in Carriere-Swallow and Cespedes (2013), who study the impact of the fluctuations of the US VXO index on a number of developed and emerging economies.==== The novel findings in this paper are that, following a US EPU shock, AEs suffer more severe and persistent declines in output and adverse impacts on their financial markets while EMEs experience negligible effects.====The main results of this paper are robust to the ordering of the variables within the US and SOE blocks. Also, substituting the VIX index as an alternative measure of risk aversion does not change our baseline results. In fact, the spillover impacts of US EPU shocks generate weaker responses, even statistically insignificant ones, compared to the baseline results. This may be due to the fact that the VIX index contains an uncertainty component commonly shared by the US EPU index.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

We investigate whether a simulation conducted under the political constraint imposed by a fiscal reaction function supports the official projection. First, we obtain Japan’s fiscal reaction function by estimating the response of the primary surpluses to the past debt for a panel data set of 23 ==== countries. Next, we investigate the political feasibility of the official projection using our estimated reaction function. When the Cabinet Office criterion is used for the debt-to-GDP ratio, the government can attain the policy target of nonnegative fiscal surpluses and realize fiscal sustainability. Notably, the negative growth-adjusted bond yield and the high growth rate contribute to this finding.","Stimulating fiscal spending after the global financial crisis led to increasing public debt-to-GDP ratios in many advanced countries. Among them, Japan has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio, and is one of the countries for which there is great concern about debt sustainability.====Nevertheless, the government reaction has been slow. The Abe cabinet launched the schedule of attaining nonnegative primary surpluses in 2020, but postponed this from 2020 to 2025. In response to the large debt, the Cabinet Office releases the fiscal balance outlook twice a year, along with the GDP growth rate that is projected to be consistent with the fiscal target of attaining nonnegative primary surpluses.====Our concern is whether this projection is politically feasible. Since Bohn’s (1998) seminal work, the literature has addressed this political constraint by considering the fiscal reaction function that links primary balances to the debt. That analysis presumes that governments increase primary surpluses in response to rising debt so as to stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio at a reasonable level. However, at very high levels of debt, governments may be subject to political constraints in which democratic voters object to ever-increasing primary surpluses in response to rising debt. The official projection does not take into account this political constraint.====The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the analysis using the fiscal reaction function supports the official projection and debt sustainability. We proceed with the analysis in two steps. First, we obtain Japan’s fiscal reaction function by estimating the response of the primary surpluses to the past debt for a panel data set of 23 OECD countries. Second, we investigate if the simulation conducted under the political constraint imposed by the fiscal reaction function supports the official projection.====The approach of using the fiscal reaction function has two advantages. First, it deals with fiscal default as a problem of the inability to pay rather than strategic default observed in developing countries (e.g., Calvo, 1988; Arellano, 2008), and is more likely to be relevant for studying public debt in advanced countries. Second, this approach is useful for studying an economy with low safe interest rates, particularly relative to the economic growth rate. The latter viewpoint is relevant to the government debt policy faced by advanced countries, where safe interest rates are unusually low.====A growing literature has focused on low rates. Blanchard (2019) develops arguments concerning the costs of public debt when safe interest rates are low. Summers (2015) stresses that recent economic downturns can be attributed to the persistently low natural interest rate.==== Caballero et al. (2017) highlight the role of the global shortage of safe assets on low rates.====To our knowledge, this paper is the first one that evaluates government fiscal projections from a theoretical perspective, and consider the effects of low rates. The literature on Japan’s government debt has used the neoclassical framework and provides results against fiscal sustainability. This literature includes Doi and Ihori (2003); Broda and Weinstein (2005); Ihori et al. (2006); Sakuragawa and Hosono (2010, 2011), Doi et al. (2011); Hoshi and Ito (2013); Matsuoka (2015); Miyazawa and Yamada (2015); Braun and Joines (2015); Hansen and Imrohoroglu (2016); Nakajima and Takahashi (2017), among others. A few works highlight the effects of low rates. Sakuragawa and Hosono (2010, 2011) build a heterogeneous agent growth model allowing for a lower safe interest rate than the growth rate and discuss the implications of low rates. Matsuoka (2015) explains the debt limit of Japan using a low subjective discount rate.====This paper is organized as follows.

As the ====. However, we also find that better access to ==== increases fiscal sustainability within the sample of OECD countries, while it does not improve the fiscal solvency in case of non-OECD countries.","This paper empirically investigates global liquidity and fiscal sustainability. Fig. 1 displays the government debt-to-GDP ratio and international debt-to-GDP among the OECD countries, in which some countries such as Ireland and Netherlands have high government debt-to-GDP ratio and high international debt-to-GDP ratio at the same time. In these cases, government’s demand on debt can be financed by international debt. However, as also shown in Fig. 1, although Japan has high government debt-to-GDP ratio compared to other OECD countries, international debt in Japan have been maintained low, indicating and government debt can be domestically financed. Thus, we will attempt to investigate the issue of fiscal sustainability in terms of whether level of international debt has a significant impact on fiscal insolvency particularly by considering the accessibility to global liquidity.====European fiscal crisis addresses the importance of fiscal sustainability in terms of managing appropriate level of fiscal expenditures. From European fiscal crisis, we have experienced that even high-income countries can be seriously exposed to fiscal insolvency problem. The European fiscal crisis provides lessons that even high-income countries can also suffer from fiscal insolvency issues. However, Lee et al. (2018) find that some EU countries have been fiscally insolvent while the other EU countries have maintained sustainable fiscal policy. Lee et al. (2018) also show that the fiscal insolvency issue is closely related to the issue of adopting Euro, which can have impact on accessibility on international debt as well as export market competitiveness due to exchange rate. Therefore, it would be important to investigate the determinant of fiscal insolvency by considering the accessibility to international debt. This issue is particularly important to the countries such as Japan, which has a significant discrepancy between total and international debts (see Fig. 1).====Previous researches investigating Japanese fiscal policy and sustainability (İmrohoroğlu et al., 2016; Doi et al., 2011) have focused on domestic demographic changes and population aging issue in Japanese economy. However, this paper focuses more on international factors such as international market accessibility to global liquidity that can affect the fiscal sustainability.====As one of the pre-crisis risk factors, Lane (2012) pointed out that private credit has increased sharply in the Euro area, before the European fiscal crisis. Moreover, external imbalance has particularly increased, which could derive a growth of international debt. The imbalance was persistent across the euro area that could lead to significant macroeconomic risk. This paper tackles with the issue of the relationship between accessibility to global liquidity and fiscal sustainability. While better access to global liquidity can relieve the domestic burden of public indebtedness and reduce the possibility of fiscal insolvency, there would be higher probability of being exposed to global risk factors as the level of the external debt increases. By using the case of the 1997 financial crisis in Korea, Lee et al. (2006) investigate the role of fiscal soundness particularly during the financial crisis period in terms of financing government expenditures for macroeconomic recovery policies. Since the periods of financial crises are related to limited accessibility to global liquidity, it would be important to investigate whether better access to liquidity can improve fiscal sustainability.====In addition to a long list of previous studies, recent studies are also investigating fiscal sustainability issues. For example, Camarero et al. (2015) investigate the relationship between government debt and fiscal sustainability using 17 OECD countries’ data. By considering co-integrated relationship between revenue and expenditure, they find weak fiscal sustainability for the 17 OECD countries.====Tran (2018) investigate the relationship between public debt and sovereign risk premium by considering non-linear relationship using data from 14 emerging countries. Panel threshold estimation results support that probability of default turn out to be accelerated as the public debt exceed a certain threshold. As Tran (2018)’s results are based on the 14 emerging countries, it would be interesting to expand analysis to the extended sample countries by including high-income and low-income countries, to understand the determinants of the fiscal sustainability across the different income groups. We can make a conjecture that there is an asymmetric behavior of fiscal sustainability depending on the level of public debt or income level.====It is worth noting that most of the previous research on fiscal sustainability have focused on the empirical analysis using data from advanced and European countries (Daniel and Shiamptanis, 2013; Fincke and Greiner, 2012; Theofilakou and Stournaras, 2012; Afonso and Jalles, 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Reinhart and Belen Sbrancia, 2011; Shambaugh, 2012; Ghosh et al., 2013; Paniagua et al., 2017) particularly after the European fiscal crisis. However, as shown in monetary policy effects depending on cross-country differences in financial structure (Ma, 2018), fiscal solvency can be different conditional on the fiscal features of country groups. Although the European fiscal crisis has raised questions about government solvency of selected countries, fiscal deficit can generate more important issues in case of the emerging or developing countries as well. For example, theories on fiscal and external balance predict that government deficit leads to an increase in interest rate and it will cause capital inflows and currency appreciation (Badinger et al., 2017; Kumar and Baldacci, 2010). Thus, it is important to examine the implication of fiscal solvency issues in different country groups classified by international heterogeneity such as income level, total debt, and accessibility to global credit and liquidity.====This paper distinguishes itself from previous studies in the following aspects. First, this paper provides empirical evidence by utilizing an extended dataset covering OECD and non-OECD countries for a long-time period. We can make a comprehensive interpretation and understand fiscal sustainability by considering an asymmetric behavior across the different groups. Most of the previous research have focused on either developed countries or developing countries. This research can provide rich implications by considering heterogeneities in the extended dataset.====Second, this paper provides an empirical evidence by categorizing the sample countries with high and low level of international debt securities. One of the distinctive finding of this paper is that better access to international liquidity can increase fiscal sustainability for the OECD countries, while it does not improve the fiscal solvency in case of the non-OECD countries. We can confirm that the impact of international debt on fiscal sustainability can vary across the different groups.====Thus, it is notable that this result can have an interesting implication for Japan that the high level of government debt-to-GDP ratio may not generate necessarily the issue of fiscal insolvency as far as the accessibility to international debt is provided, although Japan is currently maintaining a relatively low level of international debt since Japan can finance government debts domestically.====The remainder of the article is organized as follows.

However, those who are willing to start businesses often encounter financial difficulties in obtaining initial funding. Because of these difficulties, the role of informal investors―especially those who invest in new ventures, often called “angel investors” or “business angels”―is crucial for promoting entrepreneurship in countries and regions.==== Indeed, governments in many countries identify business angels as key players in vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems (OECD, 2011; Mason and Botelho, 2016). In entrepreneurial ecosystems, interactions between entrepreneurs and informal investors, including family members, friends, and business angels, play a pivotal role in promoting entrepreneurship. Owing to the importance of informal investment for new firm creation, clarifying the relationship between entrepreneurial propensity and informal investment is worthwhile to gain a better understanding of how to promote entrepreneurship. As such, developing measures that describe interactions among actors, including entrepreneurs and informal investors, is useful for promoting entrepreneurial ecosystems in countries and regions.====This study explores the link between entrepreneurship and informal investment. In the literature on small business and entrepreneurship, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) is well known as a research initiative that provides global data on entrepreneurship. Many scholars have examined entrepreneurship using GEM data (e.g., Van Stel et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2005; Langowitz and Minniti, 2007; Minniti, 2011).==== In this study, we examine what types of individuals serve as informal investors and invest in new businesses, using data from the Adult Population Survey (APS) conducted by the GEM National Teams. We identify how the link between entrepreneurship and informal investment differs across countries.====The results of this study reveal that individuals who engage in entrepreneurial activity are, on average, three times more likely to invest in new businesses than those who do not. We also find that individuals with entrepreneurial networks are more likely to invest in new businesses. More interestingly, we present estimation results for the odds ratio of business ownership/management and informal investment, as well as of entrepreneurial networks and informal investment, in each country, which may, in part, reflect the extent of entrepreneurial ecosystems at the country level. By doing so, we find that the link between entrepreneurship and informal investment differs across countries. In particular, we focus on informal investment in Japan, which is well known to have a lower level of entrepreneurship than other developed countries (Honjo, 2015; Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, 2017). Further, while the debt-financing system is well established in Japan, private equity capital is recognized as underdeveloped.==== The results of this study reveal that the proportion of individuals in Japan invest in new businesses is lower than in the United States (US) and some European countries. While the proportion of individuals who start businesses or engage in informal investment in Japan is lower than in other countries, the relationship between entrepreneurial propensity and informal investment in Japan is the greatest among 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.

Consistent with international evidence of the advanced economies, both trend growth and natural rates of interest of Japan and South Korea have been declining over the past, suggesting the important role of global factors. However, the declining patterns of Japan and South Korea are far steeper during the past 25 years. When considering domestic and global financial factors, trend growth and natural rate of South Korea are more affected by foreign financial factor while the role of domestic financial factor is more pronounced for Japanese economy.","The natural rate of interest is defined as the real short-term interest rate consistent with the constant inflation and level of natural output. Alternatively, it can be defined as the real monetary policy rate consistent with the economy operating at its full potential, following (Williams, 2015).==== In a framework of the Taylor rule, if the economy is in equilibrium, with stable inflation and unemployment at the natural rate, the central bank needs to set its policy rate equal to the natural rate of interest. In this regard, monetary policy can be considered to be accommodative or restrictive if the policy rate is less than, or greater than the natural rate, respectively.====Given the importance of the natural rate for monetary policy implementation, many analyses suggest that the natural rate of interest has become significantly lower over the past quarter century with a sharp drop occurring over the past decade. For the United States, (Williams, 2015) shows that the natural rate of interest has declined since 1980, especially after the Great Recession. (Holston et al., 2017) apply the methodology of (Laubach and Williams, 2003) to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Euro Area and find that large declines in trend GDP growth and natural rates of interest have occurred over the past 25 years in all four economies. For Japan, (Fujiwara et al., 2016) and (Okazaki and Sudo, 2018) show that the natural rate has shown a secular decline over time from the 1980s and it is likely to be currently at a low level of around 0 percent. This common situation poses the serious challenge to central banks because it can limit their ability to fight back recessions. With a low natural rate close to zero even in normal times, they will not be able to deal with recessions, since there won’t be much room to lower interest rates.====In this line of research, we measure trend growth rates and natural rates of interest of Japan and South Korea and our approach contrasts with previous research in that we incorporate financial factors. With consideration of financial cycles emphasized by (Borio et al., 2016a), we explicitly consider the effect of domestic and foreign financial cycles on the natural rate of interest. For this purpose, we consider not only the credit-to-GDP ratio as domestic financial cycle index but also a measure of risk appetite and volatility of international capital market. (Borio et al., 2016a) argue that information about financial cycles should be incorporated in measuring the potential output. They show that identifying potential output with non-inflationary output is too restrictive given that growing financial imbalances can place output on an unsustainable path even if inflation is low and stable. For example, while loose financial conditions may help support the growth of an economy in the short-term, vulnerabilities to shocks may increase in the medium or long run, which was clearly evidenced by the pre-GFC (Global Financial Crisis) period in advanced economies. In this regard, a comparison of the “finance-adjusted” output with conventional output gaps can be used to detect a warning sign of unsustainable growth. We adopt a simple and transparent framework to accommodate information about financial cycles in constructing output gap estimates proposed by (Borio et al., 2016a), (Juselius et al., 2017) and (Krustev, 2018). Although those papers capture the role of domestic financial cycles, generally measured by private credits, there are numerous studies that find the real effects of global financial cycles through not only domestic credits but also capital flows, asset prices and others ((Rey, 2018), (Eugenio Cerutti and Rose, 2017), and (Forbes and Warnock, 2012)). Considering this, we extend the existing finance-adjusted semi-structural model in a way that also captures the role of global financial cycles.====Consistent with international evidence of advanced countries, we find that trend growth and natural rates of interest of Japan and South Korea have been declining over the past, suggesting the important role of global factors.==== However, the declining patterns of Japan and South Korea are far steeper, implying the role of domestic factors in action. When considering domestic and financial factors, trend growth and natural rate of South Korea is more affected by foreign financial factors. In addition, we find that the role of domestic financial factor was significant during the bubble period of Japan and the high-interest-rate policy prescribed by IMF (International Monetary Fund) during the AFC (Asian Financial Crisis) was too tight for the Korean economy.====We also relate our empirical results with the question of “Is the economy South Korea following the Japan's long-term slump?” recently raised by many economists and commentators. One rationale for such a conjecture is that, with a 20-year gap, the demographic structure of South Korea has been following that of Japan surprisingly well and demographics is an important factor for long-term growth and real interest rate of an economy. While we confirm that the demographic structures of the two economies are almost identical with a time lag, our analysis suggests additional factors can also be important for explaining trend growth and natural rate of interest for each economy.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a review of literature. Section 3 explains our data and steps we take to measure the natural rate of interest and finance-adjusted output gap. Section 4 reports the estimation results and compares the cases of South Korea and Japan, with several robustness checks.

Miyazato Naomi,"Nihon University College of Economics, 1-3-2 Misaki-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 101-8360, Japan","Received 5 January 2020, Accepted 24 February 2020, Available online 14 March 2020, Version of Record 26 March 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japwor.2020.101006,Cited by (1),This study investigates the impact of a Japanese public health care reform—called the contract out policy—on intergenerational ,"The purpose of this study is to consider the impact of public health care reforms on intergenerational inequality and the reduction of, or partial exemption from, public health care in Japan. This is referred to as the contract out policy. It is widely known that social security costs have been steadily increasing in Japan. Recently, the impact on social security costs is shifting from public pensions to public health care. Fig. 1 depicts the trends in social security benefit costs by sector.==== For public pensions, the growth in benefit costs has been suppressed since 2010. However, the growth of health care and long-term care costs have been continuously increasing over the years. In this study, I focus on public health care, which significantly affects overall social security benefit costs, and investigate intergenerational inequality and the reduction of, or partial exemption, that is, the contract out policy, from public health care in Japan.====Many studies have investigated social security based on the pay-as-you-go system from the perspective of intergenerational inequality. However, only a few have examined how intergenerational inequality has changed in Japan. For instance, Miyazato (2015) analyzed the change in intergenerational inequality from 1990 to 2007 in Japan. According to the estimation results based on generational accounting, whereas the policy in the 1990s was to postpone the burden to future generations, this trend changed from the early 2000s and has reduced the burden on future generations. On the other hand, according to the study by Miyazato (2015), no estimation has been made since 2007. Further, there has been no examination of whether there have been any changes in Japan’s intergenerational redistribution policy since the Lehman shock. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, the impact of public health care on social security benefit costs has been becoming more pronounced than that on public pensions since 2010; however, its impact on the intergenerational redistribution policy of public health care is not discussed by Miyazato (2015). Hence, in this study, I investigate intergenerational inequality using the method of generational accounting during the period from 2000 to 2017 and the impact of public health care on intergenerational inequality. In addition, I analyze public health insurance reforms in detail.====In Japan, public pension reforms have progressed over the years, and the public pension reform of 2004 has improved the sustainability of public pensions through an increase in premiums and the introduction of macroeconomic slides. However, fundamental reforms on public health care have not been implemented. The ratio of the number of late-stage elderly people, that is, people over 75 years old, to the total population is expected to reach 18.1% by 2025, after which point significant increases in medical expenses will become necessary. Moreover, medical costs will continue to increase due to ongoing technological progress in the medical care sector. Hence, to improve the financial sustainability of the social security system, it is necessary to restrict the increase in medical expenditure.====I regard the contract out policy as a method to scale down public health insurance. The contract out policy is a scheme whereby individuals can be exempted from paying premium contributions to public insurance by enabling them to enroll in private insurance or individual insurance accounts. In this study, I assume that the medical insurance premiums exempted using the contract out policy accumulate in the individuals’ personal accounts, and I investigate whether the medical expenditure for contracting out can be covered by the individuals’ accumulated insurance premiums. Regarding medical expenditure, simulations are based on the transition probability of medical expenses calculated from individual receipt data from Chiba Prefecture in Japan, which was surveyed by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (2004).====The composition of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, I review the literature on intergenerational inequality, as well as studies on medical savings accounts. Subsequently, I describe Japan's medical insurance system, the estimation of intergenerational inequality, and the simulation method of the contract out policy in Section 3. Finally, Chapter 4 discusses the estimation and simulation results, and Chapter 5 presents some concluding remarks.",Intergenerational Inequality and the Contract Out Policy in Public Health Care,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142520300013,14 March 2020,2020,Research Article,84.0

We use measures of LTV and DTI regulations that properly reflect changes in regulation coverage and intensity. Empirical results show that LTV and DTI shocks have significant effects not only on house price and household bank loan but also on CPI and IP, particularly when both policies are implemented together. The effects of DTI shocks are similar to those of ==== shocks, but LTV and DTI shocks tend to have a slower effect on CPI and IP but a faster effect on house price and household bank loan.","The global financial crisis (GFC) was a noteworthy event that demonstrated the importance of financial stability to macroeconomic stability. Following the GFC, countries around the world recognized that financial instability can lead to systemic risks and has a negative effect on the macroeconomy. In addition, the proper implementation of macroprudential policies is important to prevent financial instability from spreading throughout the economy. As a result, the majority of central banks around the world introduced financial stability as a policy goal and began to manage all or parts of the financial system (see Jeanneau, 2014).====Similarly, financial stability for macroeconomic stability was emphasized in Korea after the GFC. In 2011, the Bank of Korea introduced the financial stability objective and is now categorized as a central bank whose financial objective is clearly attached to a specific function or task of the overall financial system (see Jeanneau, 2014). The Korean government has likewise exerted efforts to establish an appropriate framework for macroprudential policies for financial stability.====Several recent studies have analyzed the effects of macroprudential policies, as the role of such policies has become increasingly important. Most studies (e.g., Lim et al., 2011; Cerutti et al., 2015; Akinci and Olmstead-Rumey, 2018) have focused on how macroprudential policies affect financial variables such as credit, assets prices, and financial imbalances in the economy. In addition, a few recent studies (e.g., Kim and Mehrotra, 2017; Richter et al., 2019) have analyzed how macroprudential policies affect key macroeconomic indicators such as output and inflation.====The present study examines the effects of macroprudential policies such as loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI) regulations in Korea after the Asian financial crisis. The present study investigates the effects of LTV and DTI regulations on major macroeconomic indicators such as industrial production (IP) and commodity price index (CPI), which are traditional objectives of macroeconomic policies, as well as on financial variables such as housing price and household bank loan, which are the direct objectives of macroprudential policies similar to LTV and DTI regulations.====In various aspects, Korea is a particularly interesting case to analyze the macroeconomic effects of LTV and DTI regulations. First, Korea had been using LTV and DTI regulations long before the GFC and is one of the countries that regularly use LTV and DTI policies (see Kim and Mehrotra, 2015). Therefore, long sample periods of frequent policy actions are available in Korea to analyze the effects of such policies. Second, policy authorities in Korea have used macroprudential policies such as LTV and DTI regulations not only to stabilize housing prices and/or household debts but also to stimulate the economy.==== Thus, analyzing the effects of LTV and DTI regulations on key macro variables and housing market variables in Korea is natural.====This study uses carefully-constructed measures of LTV and DTI policy actions for Korea. Only a part of a region is considered in certain cases, for instance, the main area of Seoul, and targeted regions often change over time when LTV and DTI regulations are imposed. Moreover, in numerous cases, different intensities of LTV and DTI regulations are applied depending on the region, the type of financial institution, the maturity of a loan, the characteristics of borrowers, and so on. Therefore, quantifying the level of the overall regulation as a single variable is difficult. Given this difficulty, most studies (e.g., Kuttner and Shim, 2016; Kim and Mehrotra, 2018) have constructed simple dummy indices that are based on the dates of policy actions. The dummy indices indicate a tightening or a loosening without incorporating the intensity of policy actions. A few studies on LTV and/or DTI policy actions (e.g. Richter et al., 2019) have incorporated the intensity of policy actions but in a limited way. In the present study, we use LTV and DTI policy indices for Korea that can represent the overall regulation level by appropriately considering the intensity and coverage of the LTV and DTI regulations.====Monetary and macroprudential policies likely have important effects on financial stability. In addition, monetary policies likely have a remarkable effect on key macro variables such as output and price levels, which are of our main interests. Moreover, the two policies interact with each other; thus, omitting one policy when analyzing the other may be problematic. Therefore, we analyze and compare the effects of monetary and macroprudential policies.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review, and Section 3 discusses how we construct the measure of LTV and DTI regulations.

To do this, we implemented PSM estimations employing the radius matching method with 0.01 caliper and 10nearest-neighbor matchings with replacement. We found 100 matched firms in control groups(domestic firms) that corresponded to each of the 10 treated firms.====For analysis, we used a difference-in-differences (DID) framework and extended the basic ","The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) was symbolic, economic cooperation between South and North Korea from 2004 to 2016. Beginning in 2004, the KIC’s operation had been relatively stable in spite of several crises resulting from deteriorating inter-Korean relations. KIC also had grown dramatically regarding size until it was shut down in the wake of the fourth nuclear test by North Korea in January 2016. At present, whether the KIC will resume operations is unclear, but as inter-Korean relations appear to be thawing, the prospects for the discussion of inter-Korean economic cooperation and resumption of the KIC are high. The number of firms operating in the KIC had increased to 123 by 2016, with cumulative total sales of more than $ 2.2 billion. And, the industrial complex employed approximately 53,000 North Korean workers hired by South Korean firms, as well as more than 700 workers from South Korea.====Despite the uncertainty concerning reopening the complex, a first evaluation of the KIC can provide insights for firms contemplating participating in South-North economic cooperation in the future. Additionally, analyzing the performance of firms in the KIC is of great value as necessary information for discussing future economic cooperation and establishing related policies because South Korean firms could play an important role in economic cooperation between the two Koreas.====There are few previous empirical studies that analyze the performance of firms using KIC internal data (KICOX, 2010; Sukki, 2007) and survey data for those firms that have been part of the complex (KDI, 2008; Hoon, 2007; Dong et al., 2008). As an exception, Jung (2015) studied the performance of KIC firms and found that participation of KIC has no effect on the firms’ productivity. However, this study is limited in the methodology because the evaluation for the performance of KIC firms is mostly on correlation analysis. Specifically, in comparison with the KIC firms, those firms in the control groups includes all foreign-invested companies, export companies, and strictly domestic invested companies so that firms in control groups are not proper counterfactuals for the KIC firms.====In our study, we restrict firms in the control group to Korean firms that only sell domestically. One of distinguishing features of the firms in the KIC is that they could hire workers at very low wages, making them engaging in pure vertical FDI s, in which the parent company imports all the goods produced in the KIC using very low wage. Thus, the KIC firms are an ideal example of a vertical FDI engaging firms because these firms maximize their profits by establishing local factories to take advantage of the abundant cheap production factors of the host country (Helpman, 1984, 1987; Helpman, 1987). The KIC firms provide a unique opportunity to investigate the role of a pure vertical FDI s because whether a firm engages in a genuine vertical FDI or not is not clearly distinguished by the analytical data in most previous studies.====The reason is that in most cases firms decide to make investments by considering both the utilization of rich production factors in the host countries along with market access (Markusen, 1995; Hanson et al., 2001). Although theories on FDI are very diverse, most theories have both elements of the use of cheap factors of production and the use of new market access in FDI decisions.====As a result, it is difficult to distinguish between vertical and horizontal characteristics clearly. In practice, most of the FDI decisions of firms are influenced by both factors, so it was practically not possible to isolate the impact on productivity due to the utilization of rich production factors from the effect due to new market access.====Many studies related to vertical FDI have conducted as follows. According to Hayakawa and Matsuura (2011), firms engaging in pure vertical FDIs are more productive than domestic firms because trade costs would make the FDI of purely domestic firms with low productivity unprofitable and only firms with high productive remain profitable after their FDI decision.====Milner et al. (2006) examine the effect of industrial linkages between Japanese firms located in Thailand on pattern of FDI using industry data set constructed from firm-level. The results show that in addition to factor cost advantage such as lower labour cost industrial linkages can leads to agglomeration of FDI. Also Nishitateno(2013) analyzed the relationship between FDI and intermediate export. The result shows that FDI by Japanese upstream firms lead to more exports of intermediate goods from Japan.====Some research present that the presence of domestic competition undermines bargaining power of the foreign parent firms and their ownership shares in the joint ventures with domestic firms (Nakamura and Zhang, 2018). In addition, there is also a study on whether FDI promotion policies can actually attract inward FDI in Japan (Hoshi and Kiyota, 2019).====There are also empirical studies analyzing the relationship between FDI and a firm’s productivity and show that a firm’s investment decisions reflect productivity levels and that the most productive firms decide to invest abroad, that intermediate productive firms become export companies, and that the least productive firms remain in the domestic market (Helpman et al., 2004).====Similarly, previous studies on the relationship between productivity and FDI examine the mode of investment through estimated productivity such as Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003).====In this paper, exploiting a pure vertical FDI in the KIC, we first examine pre-FDI productivity and firms’ FDI decision in the KIC and verify that we could get the same conclusion of high productivity firms are more likely to engage in the FDI as previous studies (Helpman et al., 2004). Second, we examine the impact of a pure vertical FDI on post-FDI productivity. The analysis is unique in that we could isolate the impact of a pure vertical FDIs of firms on productivity due to utilizing cheap labors from the impact from having any access to a new market.====Especially, the analysis of the post-FDI impact on productivity is important because most of the previous studies focused on pre-FDI conditions and the investigations on the change in the productivity of firms after investing in KIC are rather scant. Our study is most closely related to recent two studies that examined the impact of labor cost change on a firm’s productivity. Lucht and Haas (2015) examined the effect of the influx of cheap migrant workers on firms’ productivity and found that those firms exploiting cheap wage cost by hiring more migrant workers had high productivity. Alvarez and Fuentes (2018) also studied the impact of the change in wage costs using the increase in minimum wage.====They found the increase in minimum wage reduced firm’s productivity, which is measured by using various measures for TFP, and also found that the impact is highest in the industries that most heavily rely on unskilled workers. Our study is distinguished from these studies in that the impact of labor cost change is materialized by the introduction of a pure vertical FDI and the identification of causal effect is clean because it is taken place in the KIC area.====For the estimation of the causal effect of a pure vertical FDI on firm productivity, we use an extended version of the difference-in-differences method which is also called as the event study method in Gathmann et al. (2018). We use the KIC firms (i.e., pure vertical FDI firms) as treatment group and firms that only sold to domestic market as the control group, and the introduction of FDI occurred around 2005 for the dataset that spans from 1998 to 2012. As a result, the DID framework becomes our natural choice to analyze the changes in productivity between the KIC and the purely domestic firms before and after the pure vertical FDI interventions in the KIC. We focus on the textile industry, which accounted for the majority of production in the KIC.====We found that the FDI firms in the KIC experienced productivity improvements after investment. The DID results indicate that productivity gain after the intervention is 105 %. This result is consistent with the positive effect of cheap migrant workers on firms’ productivity in Lucht and Haas (2015). Further, our event study analysis allows us to examine the dynamic effects of the FDI intervention. For the three years after the intervention, productivity gains to the KIC firms were as large as 134 %. However, the effect did not last long. Three years after the intervention, productivity gains for the KIC firms become statistically insignificant.====The paper is organized as follows. First, in Chapter Ⅱ, we explain the data used in the analysis. In Chapter Ⅲ, we propose the empirical analysis strategy and methodology. Chapter Ⅳ includes our interpretation of the results. Last, in Chapter Ⅴ, we summarize our findings and offer concluding remarks.",Participation in the Kaesong Industrial Complex and its impact on productivity: South Korean textile firms’ experiences,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142519300623,29 November 2019,2019,Research Article,86.0

We found that households who faced increased income volatility lowered their leverage ratio. A one standard deviation increase in income volatility was associated with 1.3 ∼ 1.5 percentage point decrease in the leverage ratio. The effects of income volatility changes on households’ leverage choices varied with households’ borrowing constraints and other socioeconomic backgrounds. We also found that when faced with enlarged income uncertainty, households’ income coefficients on consumption were lowered. The income coefficient of average households was estimated to be around 0.16, while households with increased income volatility were around 0.12. In particular, similar to the relations in leverage ratio changes, consumptions among potentially borrowing-constrained households and those with ‘net-short’ position in real estate assets were more affected by increases in income volatility. This can be understood that households smoothed their consumption during the periods of increased income volatility, and this was shown in the smaller consumption elasticity on income. This can be attributed to the fact that faced with increased income volatility, households lower the risk exposure of their financial net wealth by lowering their leverage ratio.","Huge household debt has become one of the most significant risks in the Korean economy. Korean household debt compared to its GDP rose from 79.7 % at the end of 2011 to 97.7 % in 2018. Gu (2007) argued that after the 1997 financial crisis, the volume and proportion of bank financing has grown as a result of risk-focused management of financial institutes. More recently, coincided with record-low interest rate and the self-fulfilling expectations of rising house prices, household debts have grown remarkably. Households’ borrowing rate from commercial banks decreased from 9.88 percent in 2010 to in 2010 were 9.88 percent to 3.14 percent in 2016, accompanied by global low interest rate environment, and the average house prices doubled during the same periods (Fig. 1).====Many studies examined the relationships among household debt, income and consumption in Korea. Choi et al. (2015), using micro data obtained from the credit bureau, found that the magnitude of wealth effects from rising house prices was greater in high income and older households. Park (2019) found similar relations that households with ‘net-long’ in real estate assets had bigger wealth effects. Song (2018) studied the relationship of household leverage and consumption. The author argued that in economic circumstances where households are highly in debt and have insufficient liquid assets, household consumption is likely to be vulnerable to negative income shocks, which could hamper aggregate spending growth.====There also exist many important researches with Japanese household micro data. Abe and Yamada (2009) found a strong relation between income risks and household consumption with detailed micro household data from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (NSFIE), which is one of the largest household surveys in the world. They confirmed the standard precautionary saving motives were found in the consumption behaviors in Japanese households. Zhou (2003) also examined the impacts of household earning uncertainty on household consumption and savings, and reported that about 5.6 percent of total saving of salaried worker are related to precautionary savings. Ogawa and Wan (2007) empirically examined the influences of household debt on consumption during and after the financial bubble in Japan with NSFIE, and found that high debt-asset ratio had negative effects on household consumptions.====However, few studies focused on the relationships between households’ income uncertainty, leverage and consumption, especially with Korean household micro data. Considering the rapidly changing socioeconomic environment, including demographic changes and adverse external demand caused by major economies’ trade tensions, Korean households face substantial changes in income uncertainty.====Chang et al. (2019), which furnished the main motivation for our research, analyzed the relations between household income uncertainty and household’s asset portfolio choices using detailed Norwegian household micro-level data. They found that if households face enlarged income uncertainty, they adjust overall risk exposure by lowering other risks such as price risks in asset choices.====Considering Korean households’ small share of financial assets and huge amount of debt, we focus on households’ leverage and consumption choices when income uncertainty changes. According to the Bank of Korea (2017), the share of financial assets in households’ total assets was 37.2 percent, which is only the half of United States’ 69.9 percent. Other major advanced economies, such as Japan (63.5 percent), United Kingdom (52.8) and Germany (42.9) also showed a relatively larger share of financial assets.====A risk averse household would decrease his/her overall risk stemming from assets and liabilities, if the risk from human wealth increases, indicating households manage their overall risk exposure of human wealth and ‘tangible’ wealth. This ‘risk management incentive’ is the starting point of our analysis. And we further consider other aspects that can exert influences on the relationship of changes of income uncertainty and household leverage/consumption.====First, borrowing-constraints are thought to be a crucial factor in examining the effects of income volatility changes on the leverage ratio. As Deaton (1992) noted, if a person faces or expects to face a borrowing constraint, he or she would save more in order to guarantee the minimum consumption levels in future periods, since increased income volatility is associated with the probability increase of being borrowing-constrained.====Second, life-cycle theory suggests that old households’ leverage ratio would be less affected by increased income volatility, since their remaining life-time income is smaller than that of young households.====Third, as Brunnermeier and Nagel (2008) noted, households’ risk aversion may differ with their wealth level. Considering that real estate assets account for the largest share in Korean households’ wealth, households who do not own houses would be more risk-averse, indicating their leverage and consumption would be more affected by changes in income uncertainty.====Fourth, distinguishing permanent and transitory income shock is also a crucial factor in examining households’ leverage and consumption responses. If households perceive the changed income uncertainty as a permanent one, they would adjust their leverage and consumption more actively.====Finally, considering households’ leverage and consumption choices at a same time, one can expect the possibility that changes in income volatility ‘directly’ affect consumption through income changes and ‘indirectly’ affect consumption through changes in debt-servicing burden. Standard consumption theory suggests that, by precautionary saving motives, increased income volatility would be associated with higher income growth rate, which is the result of the decrease of current periods’ consumption. At the same time, since increased income volatility affects households’ leverage choices, changes of debt-servicing burden also indirectly affect consumption.","Income volatility, household leverage, and consumption in Korea",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142519300453,14 November 2019,2019,Research Article,87.0

In the early stages, Korea enjoyed a large demographic dividend as large baby boom cohorts reached working age, boosting the nations productive capacity. The nation has also accumulated a stock of educated workforce at an unprecedented rate, backed by a strong household demand for higher education, and high public investment in the education sector. The abundant supply of well-educated labor force has allowed Korea to improve the competitiveness of its industries, transforming the economy into one of the worlds’ top exporters.====In this paper, we present a measure of aggregate human capital stock in Korea and evaluate the contribution of human capital to GDP growth rate from 1986 to 2017.

Many researchers have constructed a measure for country-level human capital (Barro and Lee, 1994; Cohen and Soto, 2007; Lee and Lee, 2016). One strand of literature has constructed a quality-adjusted index of labor input, as a measure of the aggregate human capital stock, with the relative wage rate or relative productivity of labor inputs from diﬀ ;erent characteristics, such as age and education level (Jorgenson et al., 1987; Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, 1993; Aaronson and Sullivan, 2001; Jorgenson et al., 2016).====In the U.S., it is well established to estimate human capital by constructing a quality-adjusted index of labor input. The methodology was pioneered by Jorgenson et al. (1987) and has continuously been developed by many others including BLS (1993); Aaronson and Sullivan (2001), and Bosler et al. (2017). This method, however, requires an extensive level of micro dataset, such as the Current Population Survey. Due to the data requirements, evidence for countries other than the U.S. is less extensive. Schwerdt and Turunen (2007) estimate the human capital indexes for euro area as a whole by combining European Community Household Panel and the European Labor Force Survey. Other researches provide the estimates for speciﬁc European countries, such as Schwerdt and Turunen (2010) for Germany, Lacuesta et al. (2011) for Spain, Bolli and Zurlinden (2012) for Switzerland, etc. Similar situation also appears in Korea. There exists limited literature that measures human capital in Korea. To the best to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to estimate the quality-adjusted index of human capital in Korea using extensive micro data sets, and analyze the source of human capital growth and its contribution on economic growth. Furthermore, we provide projections of labor-quantity and human capital growth, with various hypothetical assumptions over the period from 2020 to 2040 and explore some policy implication to deal with demographic change in the future.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 documents some features on demographic structures and labor market from 1986 to 2017 in Korea. Section 3 discusses the methodology to estimate human capital growth and investigate the sources of human capital growth. In section 4, we examine the contribution of human capital to economic growth in Korea. Section 5 presents projections of human capital growth from 2020 to 2040. The baseline projection uses the oﬃcial demographic projection in Korea but ﬁxes worked hours, employment rates, and wage rates in 2017. We then consider alternative scenarios commonly proposed to cope with the demographic change in Korea; enhancing female or elderly labor supply. We also compare these cases with two other scenarios which improve human capital of female or elderly workers. Finally, section 6 presents the concluding remarks.","Demographic change, human capital, and economic growth in Korea",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142519300428,2 November 2019,2019,Research Article,88.0

We find that the effects of class-size reduction on academic test scores are statistically and/or economically insignificant when school fixed effects are controlled. We find no evidence that small class size improves non-cognitive skills.","The general public and education administrators appear to believe that smaller class sizes contributes to greater learning and better experiences for students. However, this is far from obvious. Indeed, the literature on the economics of education has long sought evidence for the effectiveness of class-size reductions. The analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) has established positive effects of smaller class size in the context of famous Project STAR (e.g. Krueger, 1999), which was implemented in the state of Tennessee in the United States in the 1980s. Nevertheless, its external validity must be verified in each country's context.====Because conducting RCTs can be expensive and politically controversial, many researchers have attempted to estimate the effects of class-size reduction using a natural experiment. Angrist and Lavy (1999) was the first study to exploit the exogenous variation of class size generated by Maimonides’ rule, using Israeli data. That is, regulations require that the maximum class size is 40 students and that classes be split into two when 41 or more students are enrolled in a given grade. Because Maimonides’ rule is applied in many other countries outside of Israel, including Japan, many researchers have estimated the effects of class-size reduction following the approach developed by Angrist and Lavy (1999).====There are several studies on class size that use Japanese data (for example, see (Niki, 2013, Hojo, 2013, Senoh et al., 2014, Akabayashi and Nakamura, 2014, Senoh and Hojo, 2016, Ito et al., 2017)). So far, the evidence from Japan is mixed, presumably owing to differences in the statistical methods and samples chosen. Some studies report insignificant results, whereas others report positive significant effects of class-size reduction, although the effect size is typically small. From our reading of the literature, there does not appear to be any consensus about the effects of class-size reduction in Japan.====We contribute to this literature by providing an additional piece of evidence based on large scale data from an anonymous prefecture==== in Japan. Our research has the following three key features. First, our data set is large and covers all students in grades four to nine in 1064 public schools in an anonymous prefecture for three years. Although our data set is smaller than the one used by Senoh et al. (2014), which covers all sixth and ninth graders in Japanese public schools, it is much larger than the data set used in studies by, e.g., Akabayashi and Nakamura (2014), Ito et al. (2017), both of which examined data from municipality, which is a subdivision of a prefecture. Second, our data set includes non-cognitive skill measures, including conscientiousness, self-control, and self-efficacy. Evidence for the effects on non-cognitive skills is relatively scarce. Third, we control for school fixed effects to address possible omitted variable biases. Many previous studies use data from a single year, which prevents them from controlling for school fixed effects. Our large data set enables us to overcome this limitation.====Our estimates indicate that the effects of class-size reduction on Japanese and math test scores are statistically and/or economically insignificant for students in grades four to eight. In our preferred specification with school fixed effects, the only statistically significant estimate is for math test scores in grade six. This estimate implies that a 10-student reduction improves the test score by 0.03 standard deviations, which we consider very minimal. Further, we find no evidence that class-size reduction improves students’ non-cognitive skills.====We also examine the heterogeneity of class-size effects by students’ socio economic status (SES). Our estimates suggest that the effects of class-size reduction may be slightly stronger for students who do not attend a private tutoring school. However, it should be noted that our measures of SES may be endogenous, and hence, our results are suggestive at best.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We review the literature briefly in Section 2 and describe the data and present descriptive statistics in Section 3. We outline our identification strategy in Section 4.

In Japan, where high school education is non-compulsory, prefectural boards of education have retained the freedom to set admission criteria for public high schools within their prefecture, including the number of subjects tested on entrance exams. Using prefectural-level panel data, we estimate the effect of the number and choice of subjects tested at the time of high school entrance on the probability of college attendance three years later. We find that the variety of subjects tested has a positive effect on the later college enrollment. Our findings are broadly consistent with the incentive theory of testing (Lazear, 2006) and the empirical results from other countries.","In many countries, there is an increasing tendency to use paper tests as an incentive for learning with the goal of improving national educational standards and the overall level of human capital. In the U.S., for example, the ==== requires every state to implement standardized testing in order to measure the effectiveness of schools’ efforts to improve student achievement. At the same time, critics of standardized testing have suggested that the pressure on schools to raise test scores can result in teachers’ “teaching to the test.” These critics argue that students preparing for exams focus only on mandatory subjects that will appear on the exam and that teachers similarly teach only topics that tend to appear on the exam. In this way, teachers and students are said to lose incentives to study or teach a wider variety of subjects voluntarily based on their own interests or passions (Moe, 2003), thus losing an opportunity to develop elements of human capital that do not appear on mandatory exams but yet are important in the long-run.====Mandating a wider variety of subjects on entrance exams may also encourage some students—particularly those with a comparative advantage in subjects that would not otherwise have been tested—to study more. For example, if an entrance exam focuses exclusively on math and English, students who have an absolute disadvantage in these two subjects may give up on going to high school altogether and thus lose the opportunity to continue to learn math and English as well as other subjects not tested. Instead, testing additional subjects in which they have comparative advantage—such as social studies, science, and even arts or music—could encourage these students to go to high school, create opportunities for additional learning, and potentially facilitate subsequent educational achievement. However, there have been no formal empirical studies on whether the scope of the incentives created by entrance exams has a long-term effect on human capital accumulation or educational achievement.====There are several studies that examine whether breadth of curriculum taken by students have any effects on their educational achievement (Bishop, 1996; Altonji, 1995; Dolton and Vignoles, 2002). The previous studies typically use school level mean variation in curriculum or curriculum taken at earlier years as instrumental variables for identification of causality. There are also studies showing that the existence of high stakes exams can influence student learning (Angrist and Lavy, 2009; Dee and Jacob, 2007).==== Our paper takes one step further than the previous papers by using the subjects in entrance exams as an exogenous source of identifying variation to analyze the effect of the breadth of studies on educational achievement. The regional and yearly variation in exam subjects is arguably exogenous to individual students. In Japan, mandatory subjects and the curriculum at junior high school level is nationally uniform and had not been dramatically changed during the period of observations. Therefore, the regional changes in exam subjects are likely to give incentives to students to alter the breadth of study subjects. These circumstances are ideal for identifying the causal effects of the breadth of subjects studied by students on later outcomes transparently.====We analyze the effect of the number and choice of exam subjects required for admission to local public high schools on subsequent college attendance. Local prefectures, similar to states in the US, control the admissions process of students entering the prefectural high school system. Today, all prefectures require exams on five subjects (Japanese, English, mathematics, social studies, and science) for entrance to public high schools. Until 1987, however, the number of required test subjects varied from prefecture to prefecture and across time with particularly drastic changes occurring in the 1960s.==== We use this variation in the admissions policy of prefectural high schools to estimate the effect of the variety of exam subjects on educational achievement as measured by enrollment in the post-secondary education. Ours is perhaps the first to investigate the effect of the ==== of the exam subjects on any achievement measure in the literature.====We found that mandating a wider range of subjects, especially those in the category of “core” subjects, tested on public high school entrance exams facilitates subsequent college attendance. One may think that this is simply due to changes in student selection at the high school entrance level; requiring a wider range of subjects makes admissions to public high schools more costly and selective. As the number of test subjects increases, some students, who would otherwise enroll into a high school, may choose not to apply for, or fail to be admitted to, high schools. Consequently, the average ability of high school entrants becomes higher, leading to higher college attendance rates conditional on being admitted to high schools. However, this is not likely in our case. We found that the number of test subjects does not significantly influence the overall high school attendance rate (i.e., attendance including both public and private schools), nor substantially alter the student’s choice between public and private high schools. Based on these findings, we argue that the effect of subject variety can raise student’s incentive to learn, and improve subsequent educational achievement, without substantially changing the degree of screening. We also found that, while subject variety has in general significantly positive effects on college enrollment, in some cases it has much weaker and even insignificant effects on enrollment at post-secondary institutions such as vocational schools and public polytechnic colleges. We argue that these results are broadly consistent with the incentive theory of testing (Lazear, 2006) and the empirical results from other countries.====The next section summarizes the economic roles of exams in the literature and suggests a number of testable hypotheses. Section 3 describes the institutional background of secondary education in Japan and historical episodes related to changes in entrance exams for public high schools.

In 1999, the Japan Student Services Organization revised the eligibility criteria of the student loan system based on household earnings. Before the revision, the maximum allowable earnings for student loan applications differed across regions; some region’s had lower criteria than others. After the revision, the criteria for regions with lower maximum allowable earnings were adjusted upwards to match regions with higher ones. We conducted a difference-in-differences estimation by using municipal panel data from 1998 to 2003. We found that the expansion of eligibility for student loans improved the male college enrollment rate by around 0.5 to 0.7% points, while female enrollment was less sensitive to the expansion of student loan eligibility. The impact of the student loan eligibility expansion is larger for low income areas.","Human capital accumulation (e.g., via higher education provision) is one of the most important approaches to improving productivity and bridging income disparities. In Japan, the demand for higher education has increased in the past several decades, with increased employability along with the consequent decreased unemployment rates for those with higher education. In 2010, approximately 45% of adults attained tertiary education, and the percentage of students continuing their tertiary education was an estimated 54.3%. The return to higher education is estimated to be around 5–10% in Japan (Sano and Yasui, 2009; Nakamuro et al., 2017; Kikuchi, 2017).====Investment in higher education is heavily dependent on private sources in Japan. For example, of the total amount spent on tertiary-level education, 50.7% came from household expenditures (OECD, 2012). Additionally, the OECD highlights that although tertiary tuition fees are high, and financial aid is limited, Japan remains one of the countries with the lowest levels of public expenditure on tertiary education against their GDP: 0.5% compared to the OECD average of 1.1%. Policy makers and education researchers advocate for an increase of student aid options for students in higher education (Kobayashi, 2009).====One of the major student aid sources in Japan is the student loans system offered by the Japan Student Services Organization (hereafter JASSO). The proportion of university students who are loan recipients was 38.2% in 2012. The loan amount offered by JASSO would sufficiently cover almost all the tuition fees at national/public institutions and 80–99% of the fees at private universities. JASSO’s loan facilities aim to provide financial assistance to academically excellent students who are unable to pursue their studies due to financial reasons.====Understanding the mechanisms by which financial aid for household affects educational investment in higher education would have important policy implications. For example, in the case of imperfect financial market, if low-income households with financial constrains invest less in their children’s education than wealthier households, offering student loan by government can be justified on equity grounds. Evaluating the impact of student loan on investment in higher education offers the information about the design of student loan system such as the loan amount, the eligibility criteria for student loans.====While the study of the impact of student loans on tertiary enrollment remains important for researchers and policymakers, there are two challenges to identify the impact in Japan. Firstly, the challenge in attempting to identify the causal impact of student loan on college enrollment is the endogeneity of receiving a loan. Since student loans are received by students with better academic backgrounds, their student loan variable could reflect unobserved student characteristics that affect the decision to go to college. In a vast literature, researchers have tried to eliminate the unobservable factors using experimental design. For example, Dynarski (2000, 2003), Cornwell et al. (2006), Singell et al. (2006), Winters (2012), and related literatures utilize exogenous variation in both birth cohort and birth place to evaluate State Merit Aid Program in US.==== It is not easy to find this situation, because Japanese student loan system is setting unitary.====Secondly, there is insufficient research to examine the effects of student aid in Japan due to the lack of a proper data set for analysis of the determinants of college enrollment. Previous research in Japan used aggregated data (Zani, 1989) or micro data with restriction. Nakamura (1993) used the Employment Status Survey and found a positive relationship between parental background and college enrollment only for co-resident high school student in metropolitan areas. Kobayashi (2009) also found a positive relationship between parental background and college enrollment for freshman using the Student Life Survey. Employment Status Survey, large sample cross-section data with rich information about household, can link the information between household situation and college enrollment only for co-resident college students after enrollment decision due to survey design. Student Life Survey has rich information about college students, but does not include information at the timing of enrollment decision. Neither previous study analyzed the effect of receipts of student loans prior to entrance into college on decision to enroll the college due to data limitation.====In this paper, we focus on the JASSO reform in 1999 to identify the effect of student loans on college enrollment using municipality panel data to solve these problems. One of the most fundamental revisions of this reform was the change in the eligibility criteria for student loans based on household earnings depending on the recipient’s municipality of residence. Before the revision, the maximum allowable earnings for student loan applications differed across regions; the criteria for some regions were lower than others. After the revision, the criteria in the regions with lower maximum allowable earnings were adjusted upwards to match regions with higher ones. In other words, this meant that after the revision, more high school students living in regions with the lower criteria were eligible for JASSO college loans. This situation provided us with relevant and appropriate context for a natural experiment to identify the effect of eligibility expansion for student loans while controlling for unobserved factors that may affect the decision to enroll in tertiary education. Additionally, we use the municipality panel data based on ====. This survey, school-related statistics, includes number of college and university students enrolled from surveyed school, but does not include the household-related information. Aggregating school information by school-located municipalities and merging to other municipality data sets allow us to analyze the relationship between household situation and enrollment decision.====This study makes at least two contributions to the extant literature. Firstly, we offer the evidence about the causal impact of student loan on college entrance. Our paper is in the line with previous studies that have applied exogenous variations, such as natural experiments, to identify the impact of student aid on educational outcomes using variation in both birth cohort and birth place such as State Merit Aid Program in US (Dynarski, 2000, 2003; Cornwell et al., 2006; Singell et al., 2006; Winters, 2012; Sjoquist and Winters, 2015). In this study, we extend the literature on this topic by evaluating the expansion effects of student loan eligibility by utilizing exogenous and regional variation in Japan with unite system. Secondly, evaluating the impact of student loan on college enrollment in Japan is important for educational policy. Despite heavier burden of tertiary education on private sector, Japan is one of the highest shares of tertiary-educated adult of all OECD countries. This study offers the evidence about the design of student loan system.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the educational system in Japan in general with a specific focus on the 1999 reform. Section 3 describes the data, and Section 4 describes the empirical strategy employed in this study. Section 5 presents the empirical results.

However, the contribution of the demand shock is negligible in explaining output and ==== variations in Korea.","The recent years have seen a surge of interest on heterogenous agent new Keynesian (HANK hereafter) models which tackle many important issues in macroeconomics. Quantitative HANK models augmented with market incompleteness and heterogeneity address the effects of targeted transfer (Oh and Reis, 2012), the transmission of monetary policy (Kaplan et al., 2018), the forward guidance puzzle (McKay et al., 2016), and the distributional effects of monetary policy (Auclert, 2018). Kaplan et al. (2018) show that the HANK model is successful in delivering the general equilibrium effect of monetary policy comparable to the one in the data, while the monetary policy in a representative agent new Keynesian (RANK hereafter) model is entirely from the intertemporal substitution effect. However, the lack of analytical tractability associated with HANK models limits our understanding of the mechanisms behind the driving forces of business cycles.====There is an extensive empirical literature showing that consumption tracks current income for a large fraction of US population. Using aggregate data, for example, Campbell and Mankiw (1989) found that 40–50% of the US population merely consumed their current income. Many studies using asset holdings data also show that a small fraction of the US population holds assets. The European countries are no exception. Jung and Kim (2019) applied Kaplan et al. (2014)'s method to KLIPS (Korean Labor and Income Panel Study) covering from 1998 to 2016, Korean household micro-data, to analyze Korean households. According to Jung and Kim (2019), about 30–40% of Korean households is Hand-to-Mouth households in the sense that they have net liquid assets less than their monthly income, which are comparable to the empirical studies in the U.S. and Europe. The existence of a substantial fraction of constrained households in the Korean micro-data warrants to explore the driving forces of business cycle in Korea utilizing a TANK model.====The TANK model has the familiar three equations as the ones in the RANK model: the new Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC hereafter), the aggregate demand or the expectational IS curve, and the Taylor rule. The aggregate demand equation in the TANK model differs from the RANK model in that the aggregate output depends upon the share of constrained households as well as the redistribution policy in place.====In this paper, we turn to the analytically tractable two agent new Keynesian (TANK hereafter) model with simple heterogeneity across households to address the effect of financial market incompleteness over business cycles in Korea since mid-1970s. The earlier literature on two-agent models has emphasized the important role of the prevailing fiscal policy in shaping the effect of monetary policy on the economy (Galí et al., 2007, Bilbiie, 2008). In recent, Bilbiie (2018) and Debortoli and Galí (2018) show that a TANK model is very useful to improve our understanding about the relative importance of indirect income effect relative to direct effect or substitution effect in the transmission of a transitory change in monetary policy.====This paper sets up a tractable TANK model and adopts the methodology of Smets and Wouters (2007) and Ireland (2011) to address the following questions. Does there exist any meaningful share of constrained households in Korea? If so, how the share of constrained households vary before and after 1997 when Korea bailed out? Finally, does the relative importance of technology shocks and cost-push shocks in explaining the business cycle in Korea change around the financial crisis? If so, how much do they contribute the variations of output and inflation rates? For this purpose, we first set up a TANK model with three shocks, i.e. a cost-push shock, technology shock, and monetary shock. Second, we estimate the key parameters with quarterly data from Korea employing maximum likelihood along with Ireland (2004). Finally, we evaluate the relative importance of each shock over the business cycle and discuss the implied interest rate rules from the data.====The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows.====First, there is a significant share of constrained households in Korea since mid-1970s, where the estimate of the share of constrained households shows that about one-third of households are hand-to-mouth households. The relatively higher estimate of the share of constrained households in the second subperiod than in the first subperiod partly explains the occurrence of consumption puzzle==== in Korea since the Asian financial crisis.====Second, the technology shocks are the more important in explaining the variations of output both in the first and second subperiod. The contribution of the demand or preference shock in the variations of output is negligible both in the first and second subperiod. The supply shock has driven output fluctuation since mid-1970s.====Third, the monetary shocks are most important in the variations of inflation rate than any other shocks. It explains more than 70% of interest rate variation both in the first and second subperiod. The substantial contribution of demand shocks in the interest rate fluctuations shows that the Bank of Korea has some difficulty in curbing inflation rate since Korea is essentially a small open economy, heavily dependent on the rest of world.====This paper is composed as follows. In Section 2, we specify a canonical two agent new Keynesian model. In Section 3, we derive an equilibrium and discuss the implications of the model related to interest rates and real activities. In Section 4, we discuss the quantitative implications of the model.

We find substantial disparities in cognitive skills among students from different socio-economic backgrounds. While the overall effect of class size on cognitive ability of ninth-grade students is small, we find that class-size reduction has a larger effect on cognitive ability of economically disadvantaged students. We find no signs related to systematic enrollment manipulation.","Debates on the effect of class size on students’ achievements have gained widespread interest for 2 decades, beginning with the seminal works of Angrist and Lavy (1999) and Krueger (1999). In particular, a quasi-experimental research design proposed by Angrist and Lavy (1999), which exploits exogenous variation in grade-level enrollment and a maximum class size rule (Maimonides’ rule), has been applied to data for other countries. Some studies report statistically significant gains from small classes (Angrist and Lavy, 1999 for Israel; Bonesrøning, 2003 for Norway; Urquiola, 2006 for Bolivia), others find an insignificant effect of class size (Leuven et al., 2008 for Norway; Angrist et al., 2017 for Italy). In a recently published paper, Angrist et al. (2017) updated their previous analysis (Angrist and Lavy, 1999) by exploiting more recent data from Israeli schools and found precisely estimated zero effect of small classes.====As in other countries, in Japan, the effect of class-size reduction has been discussed in recent years. Because most Japanese public schools organize classes according to a class-size cap rule regulated by law, the Angrist–Lavy method can be easily applied to data for Japanese schools. Akabayashi and Nakamura (2014) found a slightly positive effect of small classes on the test score (and its growth) of Japanese language for sixth-grade students. Hojo (2013) found a significant but heterogeneous effect of class-size reductions; a statistically significant effect of class size was found only in the lower part of the class-size distribution. Niki (2012) reported a statistically insignificant effect of class size on academic achievement but found a positive class-size effect on students’ confidence in mathematics learning. To the best of our knowledge, most of the research using Japanese data has found statistically insignificant or only marginally significant gains from small classes.====In the literature, several studies have determined that there is heterogeneity in the gains from small classes among students from different socio-economic backgrounds. Using data obtained from a randomized experiment in the United States, well known as Project STAR, Krueger (1999) showed that class size has a larger effect on minority students and those on free lunch than on other students. In addition, Piketty (2004), applying the Angrist–Lavy method to data from French primary schools, showed that the effect of class-size reduction is larger for economically disadvantaged students. However, Akabayashi and Nakamura (2014) found larger gains from small classes in schools located in areas where average land prices were relatively high.====In this study, we revisit the class size question for Japan with student-level achievement data combined with data from a large-scale parents (guardians) survey conducted in 2013. The data include detailed information about home environment and socio-economic status (SES) of parents. This enables us not only to control for the effect of parental SES in the regression analyses but also to examine whether the effects of class size differ among students from different socio-economic backgrounds. We apply the Angrist–Lavy estimation method to the data, after checking the enrollment manipulation problem discussed in Angrist et al. (2017). We then show that while most schools in the sample follow the class-size cap rule, some schools organize smaller classes than those predicted by the rule. In these schools, we find obviously low parental SES.====Our estimation results reveal that gains from small classes in the ninth grade are positive and statistically significant for both Japanese language and mathematics. The size of the effect is 0.18 standard deviation in the correct answer rate in mathematics through reducing the class size by 10 students, although this effect is mainly driven by small schools with fewer than 20 enrollments. Furthermore, gains from small classes are found to be large and statistically significant only in economically disadvantaged schools. These results suggest that class-size reductions in the lower secondary schools of economically disadvantaged areas would reduce the test-score gap among students. On the other hand, we find little correlation between class size and the use of tutoring school outside of school hours.====The next section briefly reviews the institutional background on Japanese school system. Section 3 provides a brief explanation of the data used, as well as some descriptive analysis. Section 4 explains the methodology of our regression model analysis and Section 5 presents our key estimation results. Section 6 concludes.",Do the disadvantaged benefit more from small classes?

The random matching of teachers and students in Japan and our application of the time dimension of panel data to two subjects, mathematics and science, allow us to control for unobserved heterogeneities such as individual fixed effects and school fixed effects. We confirm that instructional time is more effective in combination with higher-quality teachers, as measured by common indicators such as experience, schooling, and academic major. We also find that these effects are larger for students whose socioeconomic status (SES) is lower.","Education systems and policies are of great interest to economists because according to human capital theory (Becker, 1962), they are instrumental in determining the productivity of individuals in later life, with higher achieving students moving on to better colleges and obtaining higher wages in adulthood. Accordingly, estimating the production function of education is a main concern in the economics of education because education can be considered a derived demand in the labor market, with academic achievement investigated as a factor in wage determination. However, the study of academic achievement can also provide insight into other fundamental economic issues such as intergenerational transfer and economic disparity, and in this context, compulsory education is especially important not only because the returns to early education tend to be higher (Heckman, 2006) but also because compulsory education can potentially reduce inequality, given that it provides all children with equal accessibility to education regardless of socioeconomic status (SES). Moreover, compulsory education has the positive externality of equipping all children with basic academic skills such as literacy and numeracy, providing a common foundation for understanding one another and increasing productivity as adults. For all of these reasons, since Coleman et al. (1966), the precise determinants of student performance have long been the subject of intense theoretical debate and empirical study. Many studies such as (e.g. Todd and Wolpin, 2003) have attempted to identify the determinants of student output by either estimating the education production function or by using value-added models because these methods are amenable to a quantitative analysis of the costs and benefits of inputs. Educational inputs such as teacher quality, family background, and educational system variables such as class size and instruction time are typical in this literature, which aims to find the optimal allocation of school inputs that maximizes student output subject to budget constraints.====Among the vast range of potential school inputs, an increase in instruction time is considered one of the most efficient uses of school resources due to its low marginal cost compared to other choices such as decreasing class size and hiring new teachers, and because of its simplicity, this option has been implemented in many developed and developing countries.====Accordingly, the effect of instruction time on student cognitive ability as measured by test scores has also been widely studied, including Wößmann (2003), Bellei (2009), Hansen (2011), Fitzpatrick et al. (2011), Meyer and Van Klaveren (2013), Lavy (2015), Rivkin and Schiman (2015), Battistin and Meroni (2016), and Cattaneo et al. (2017).====However, the literature provides little insight as to how best to increase instructional time. Since resources are limited, this is a serious oversight, and it is therefore important to identify the most effective means of increasing instruction time by considering, as Lavy (2015) suggests, not only the quantity of instructional time but also the quality. When we also consider the quality of instruction, we find that the effects of increased instruction time are heterogeneous depending on teacher, school, and classroom characteristics. For example, we can understand that the impact of more instruction time on student performance may be higher when teachers are highly skilled, educated, and experienced.====With the above discussion in mind, this paper investigates the quality of instruction time in Japan by using the seventh national curriculum standards revision in 2002 to consider which methods of increasing instruction time have the greatest impact on raising student test scores, with particular attention to whether or not the effects of increased instruction time depend on factors such as teacher quality. For this study, we obtained data on instruction time, student test scores, and school and teacher characteristics for each subject (math and science) and student from TIMSS, which is one of the few sources of detailed information on the school environment and teacher characteristics corresponding to an individual student. We follow a similar identification strategy as Dee (2005) and Lavy (2015), who apply a fixed effects method using variations between subjects within students. However, while this type of empirical study typically employs large data sets from many countries to ensure sufficient variation (see Lavy (2015) and Rivkin and Schiman (2015), for example), this introduces potential heterogeneity across countries. Because the seventh Japanese curriculum standards revision in 2002 reduced instruction time in mathematics but not in science for second-year junior high school students, we obtain sufficient variation in instruction time without relying on cross country variation and so can avoid this issue by using data from a single country. In addition, because the matching of students and teachers is close to random in Japanese public schools in survey periods, this eliminates another source of potential endogeneity bias, as discussed later. The contribution of this paper is that we are the first to examine the effect of changes in instruction time due to teacher, class contents and gender match between students and teachers. We carefully handle several potential sources of bias. In addition, we have shown a mechanism through which teacher characteristics affect student test scores by considering the quality of instruction time, which is suggested by Coenen et al. (2018).====We find that the combination of instruction time and other school resources are important, and that the effects of instruction time are heterogeneous depending on teacher characteristics. For example, adding one class (50 min) is more effective by a 27.5% standard deviation in the distribution of test scores for students taught by teachers with a postgraduate degree compared to teachers without one. These results are robust after addressing potential concerns about endogeneity and the method of constructing the test score. Further, the impact is larger for students of lower socioeconomic status. Taken together, these results suggest that inequality in the learning of academic subjects can be reduced with an appropriate combination of school resources.====This paper is deeply related to recent debates about Japanese education system reform and academic achievement. Prior to the 2002 revision in the national curriculum standards, and drawing on studies of Japanese education extending back to the mid-1980s, national debate had focused on what was felt to be an excessively intensive Japanese compulsory education system and the need to give students more free time to pursue other interests. The 2002 educational reform aimed to provide students with a more “relaxed education” (====) by reducing instructional time (e.g. eliminating school on Saturdays). Kawaguchi (2016) and Kubota (2016) are two of the few studies that have examined the 2002 reform empirically. Kawaguchi (2016) examines how a change in the intensity of compulsory education affects the time use and academic achievement of children from different socioeconomic backgrounds, finding that the reduction in instructional time increased socioeconomic disparity. Meanwhile, in a study that explains why this might have occurred, Kubota (2016) examines how the reform affected household expenditures on education and finds that higher income households increased expenditures on supplementary after-school education. Both Kawaguchi (2016) and Kubota (2016), however, investigate the effects of the 2002 reform from the perspective of the household, while our study is focused on schools and teachers.====The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 summarizes the literature, focusing particularly on two important papers related to this study, while Section 3 explains the Japanese compulsory education system and the revision of curriculum standards. Section 4 describes the data and Section 5 explains the estimation methods and identification strategies.

(1997, DGTW) for fund performance. Our extended DGTW model re-decomposes characteristic selectivity (CS) and characteristic timing (CT) into rebalancing and holding parts, and average style (AS) into excess AS over market and market return. Our model is applied to evaluate the performance of Chinese equity funds, and the empirical findings are as follows. First, the superior selectivity of Chinese fund managers depends on holding CS, however, their inferior timing ability is due to both rebalancing and holding CTs. Second, excess AS over market indicates poor style selectivity among fund managers. Third, DGTW (1997) reveals good timing ability in 2008 and 2011 when the stock market was bearish. The extended DGTW model shows that superior CTs (inferior CSs) in 2008 and 2011 result from both superior (inferior) rebalancing and holding abilities of fund managers. Finally, style selectivity is not found generally, but in bearish markets, implying that excess AS over market seems to be positively related to CT.","With the rapid growth of the world-wide equity fund industry, performance evaluation of mutual funds has been an important issue for both academics and practitioners. Since Treynor and Mazui (1966) and Jensen (1968), many studies have investigated the issue of fund performance evaluation. Performance evaluation should be based on risk-adjusted or abnormal return, not on raw return. In general, pricing models, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM) and the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model are used to adjust the risk of a fund.==== While most studies are against the value of active fund management, Gupta-Mukherjee (2013) supports the outperformance of active management.====Without using pricing models, Brinson et al. (1986) first decompose portfolio performance to evaluate securities selection and the timing abilities of pension fund managers.==== Grinblatt and Titman (1989) first use portfolio holdings data to evaluate the performance of equity funds, but fail to overcome the benchmark-error problem suggested by Roll (1978).==== Jiang et al. (2007) also use portfolio holdings data to examine the timing ability of fund managers, and Grinblatt and Titman (1993) propose a new performance measure that has less benchmark problems.====A seminal paper by Daniel et al. (1997, DGTW) develops a decomposition model for the performance evaluation of equity mutual funds. They decompose equity fund performance into characteristic selectivity (CS), characteristic timing (CT), and average style (AS). Da et al. (2011) extend DGTW (1997) model by re-decomposing the trade component of selectivity into impatient trading and liquidity provision. Recently, Fulkerson (2013) develops new measures of the value of active fund management based on DGTW (1997), and concludes that the period of 1995–2007 does not demonstrate any skill of fund managers contrary to prior results. Because Da et al. (2011) and Fulkerson (2013) provide different perspectives from previous studies, they must be meaningful extensions of DGTW (1997). The above studies have focused on U.S. equity mutual funds because of the availability of fund holdings data.==== Recently, the Chinese mutual funds have been attracting interests from many scholars and academic research is being done. Wang and Ko (2017) investigate the implications of fund manager turnover in China, and Wang et al. (2016) study the relationship of fund incubation with copying Chinese equity funds. However, performance evaluation of Chinese equity funds has been rarely undertaken, despite the rapid growth of the Chinese stock and fund markets.====This study extends DGTW (1997) from the perspective of rebalancing and holding abilities of fund managers, and apply it to Chinese equity funds. Active abilities of fund managers should be highly appreciated if private information that contradicts the public information plays an important role in achieving superior average performance, as suggested by Cullen et al. (2010). While active abilities are divided into timing and selectivity in a traditional sense, they can also be divided into portfolio rebalancing and buy-and-hold strategies, which, in this study, are called ‘rebalancing’ and ‘holding’ abilities, respectively. To deeply understand the rebalancing and holding abilities of fund managers, this study re-decomposes timing (CT) and selectivity (CS) into rebalancing and holding parts, and AS into excess AS over market and market return.====The empirical findings are as follows. First, the superior selectivity of Chinese fund managers depends on holding CS, however, their inferior timing ability is due to both rebalancing CT and holding CT. Second, excess AS over market indicates poor style selectivity among fund managers. Third, DGTW (1997) reveal timing ability in 2008 and 2011 when the stock market was bearish. This is consistent with practical belief and newspaper articles. The extended DGTW model shows that, in 2008 and 2011, superior CTs (inferior CSs) originate from both superior (inferior) rebalancing and holding abilities of fund managers. Finally, style selectivity is not found generally, but in bearish markets, implying that excess AS over market is positively related to CT. The above findings show that both the DGTW (1997) and extended DGTW models explain the performance of Chinese equity funds well.====This study contributes to the extant literature in two ways: First, it extends the DGTW (1997) model from the perspective of rebalancing and holding abilities. Second, our extended DGTW model is applied to Chinese equity funds, and is found to explain their performance adequately.====This paper is structured as follows.

We find that population aging proxied by old-age population share (or old-age dependency ratio) negatively affects economic growth only when it reaches a certain high level and its negative effects grow stronger as population aging deepens. The nonlinear relationship between population aging and economic growth is associated with the historical nonlinear relationship between the shares of old and working-age population. In the early stages of a demographic shift in most countries, as the old-age population share increases, the working-age population share also tends to increase. Only when the share of old-age population is sufficiently high, the increase in the share of old-age population has coincided with the decline in the share of working age population, thereby having a negative relationship with economic growth. These results can clarify why some previous papers failed to uncover a negative relationship between aging population and economic growth. We also find that population aging has hampered economic growth during more recent years, especially in more aged countries which are mostly developed countries.","During the past few decades, most countries have experienced rapid changes in the age structure of their populations. For example, many East Asian countries have experienced a rapid shift in their age structure from a high youth-age population share to a high working-age population share and then to a high old-age population share. A rapid increase in working-age population share occurred in these countries during the 1970s and 1980s and this transition contributed substantially to East Asia’s so-called economic miracle (Bloom and Williamson, 1998). Such a period of demographic dividend did not last long, however. These countries in Asia are now experiencing population aging at a rate higher than in any other regions.====As compared to medium-age workers (more generally, the working-age population), the elderly participate less actively in the labor force, their productivities are lower (Skirbekk, 2003; Aiyar et al., 2016; Liu and Westelius, 2016), and they save less (Park and Shin, 2012; Horioka and Niimi, 2017). Thus, if a number of people in the working-age population are replaced by an equivalent number among the old-age population, other things being equal, then population aging in a country will hamper its economic growth, thus imposing a significant demographic burden.====However, previous empirical studies examining the overall impact of population aging on economic growth have often yielded mixed results, as reviewed in Nagarajan et al. (2013). For example, using a panel dataset for the period 1960–2005, Bloom et al., 2008aBloom et al., (2008a, 2008b) find that the effect of old age on growth is negative in the short run but insignificant in the long run. Similarly, using the partial adjustment model in a panel framework and a dataset for 80 countries for the period 1960–2005, Lee et al. (2013) find that population aging does not appear to hold back economic growth. More recently, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) argue that countries experiencing more rapid aging have grown more rapidly because of the more rapid adoption of automation technologies in these countries.====In contrast, using a sample of 142 countries for the period 1960–2014, Lee et al. (2017) find that population aging has a negative impact on economic growth in both the short run and the long run. Eggertson et al. (2017) show that in a more recent period (2008–2015), as compared to the period 1990–2008, the correlation between aging and GDP growth has become negative. Maestas et al. (2016) find that using the U.S. states data for the period 1980–2010, population aging decreases the growth rate of GDP per capita.====Most, if not all, previous studies used the old-age population share or the old-age dependency ratio as a proxy for aging and presume that the effect of population aging on economic growth is linear, irrespective of the level of population aging. In theory, however, as explained in Section (2), while the relationship between economic growth and working-age population share is linear, that between economic growth and the old-age or young population share is nonlinear. Hence population aging may impact economic growth negatively only when it reaches a certain high level and its impact gets stronger as population aging deepens.====One of the major reasons why aging exerts nonlinear effects on economic growth might be the changing structure of the entire population in history. One may expect that as the old-age population share increases, there will be relatively fewer people included in the working-age population. However, as the old-age population share increases, the sum of the youth-age and working-age population shares should decrease. Therefore, an increasing old-age population share may coincide with an increasing working-age population share if the youth-age population share decreases at a higher rate.====Indeed, in the early stages of a demographic shift in most countries, as the old-age population share increases, the working-age population share also tends to increase. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. As can be seen in the figure, Japan’s old-age population (65 and above) share has been increasing, from 5.6% in 1960 to 26.6% in 2016. During this period, Japan’s old-age dependency ratio also increased from 8.8% to 43.9%. However, the working-age population share increased from 64.5% in 1960 to 69.8% in 1992 and since then began to decrease. The figures in the right panel reveal that this is also true for Republic of Korea: both the old-age share and the old-age dependency ratio have increased while the working-age population share has increased, from 53.4% in 1960 to 73.4% in 2013. Only from 2014 did the working-age share begin to decrease.====Fig. 2(A) redraws such a remarkable relationship between the old-age population share and the working-age population share. In the case of Japan, until the old-age population share reached 12.3% in the year 1991, the annual increases in the old-age population share were accompanied by increases in the working-age population share. Since then, the working-age population share has decreased, while the old-age population share has increased. In the case of Republic of Korea, until the old-age share reached 11.5% in 2013, population aging progressed, while the working-age population increased. As seen in Fig. 2(B), a very similar pattern is also observed if the old-age dependency ratio replaces the old-age share.====As long as the demographic burden due to the increasing share of old-age population is smaller than (or similar to) the demographic dividend due to the increasing share of working-age population is greater, the “overall” effect of population aging on economic growth may not necessarily be significantly negative. In this study, therefore, we systematically show that the nonlinear relationship between population aging and economic growth is associated with the historical nonlinear relationship between the shares of old and working-age population. As this historical nonlinear relationship is combined with the positive linear relationship between the share of working-age population and economic growth, a nonlinear relationship arises between the share of old-age population and economic growth. When the share of old-age population is sufficiently high, the increase in the share of old-age population has coincided with the decline in the share of working age population, thereby having a negative relationship with economic growth. These results can clarify why some previous papers failed to uncover a negative relationship between aging population and economic growth.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Because of the political conflict, Japanese firms faced considerable decrease in exports to China. By using Japanese firm-level data for the period 2011–2013 and by employing the difference-in-differences method, we analyze the impact of the conflict on employment in Japan. The estimation results provide evidence that Japanese firms exporting to China tended to respond to the exogenous trade shock by reducing their number of temporary workers. This finding suggests that trade shocks due to the international conflict hit the most insecure workers.","When the Japanese government announced the nationalization of three privately-owned islands, which are part of a group of islands known as the Senkaku islands==== in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China in September 2012, a territorial row over the islands dramatically escalated into a political conflict between Japan and China.==== The political conflict led to nationwide anti-Japanese demonstrations and boycott of Japanese products in China. Several Japanese firms temporarily shut down their factories to avoid attacks from anti-Japanese protesters. The conflict affected Japanese exporters to China.==== For instance, facing sluggish car sales in China, Nissan Motor Corporation decided to discontinue car exports to China until January 2013.==== Toyota Motor Corporation intended to stop its production in China in October 2012 and to discontinue all vehicle exports to China.====Many studies on trade have demonstrated the extent to which international trade is affected by external demand shocks. For example, analyses of the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis on international trade have shown how seriously the reduction in global demand damaged international trade.==== In addition to these demand shocks, the recent increase in political tension and conflict may bring about external shocks to global demand and consequently disturb the sound development of international trade. Many economists have attempted demonstrating the extent to which demand shocks due to political conflict affect international trade by using country- and industry-level trade data.====With regard to the firm level, it is natural to expect firms to change their production and supply to match the demand, as a reaction to demand shocks caused by the fluctuation of international trade. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, analyses of the impact of political tension and conflict on corporate behavior have been limited. In particular, there have been few attempts to investigate such impacts based on firm-level data compared with aggregated data. To bridge this research gap, this study uses Japanese manufacturing firm-level data to examine the extent to which firms react to demand shocks caused by political conflict.====Consumer boycott against products of a counterpart’s economy and a political conflict may negatively affect bilateral trade. Empirical studies have examined the impact of consumer boycotts in the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War on the bilateral trade between the United States and France (Chavis and Leslie, 2009, Michaels and Zhi, 2010, Davis and Meunier, 2011). A comprehensive study on this topic is presented by Heilmann (2016), who examines the impact of consumer boycotts on international trade by using political incidents such as the boycott of Danish products by Muslim countries after the 2005–2006 Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, the boycott of Japanese products in China after the 2012 Senkaku Islands conflict, the boycott of Israeli products by Turkey over the 2014 Gaza conflict, and the boycott of French products in the United States over the 2003 Iraq War. By using monthly product-level trade data, he shows that consumer boycotts depress bilateral trade and that the negative effects are more pronounced in consumer goods than in intermediate goods.====Considering domestic market and multilateral trade, firms respond to external demand shocks in several ways; for instance, exporting firms may adjust their supply destinations across domestic and export markets to match production to lower foreign demand. Certainly, such firms may respond to a shock by “substituting” output between their domestic and export markets when they face demand shocks in a foreign market. Vannoorenberghe (2012) provides evidence supporting this view, using French firm-level data for the period 1998–2007. By contrast, empirical results support that variations in domestic sales are positively correlated with those in exports. For instance, Berman et al. (2015) show complementarity between domestic and export sales when firms face exogenous shocks in foreign markets, according to the French firm-level data combined with destination-specific export data for 1995–2001. However, how firms adjust their production and supply destinations to respond to demand shocks remains an empirical question.====Firms may adjust not only their supply destination but also the size of production and input factors. To clarify this, we evaluate the impact on both output and input factors. It should be noted that few attempts have been made to adjust input factors when firms face foreign demand shocks. In particular, how the exporter's employment changes in response to unexpected demand shocks remains to be examined. When the effect of demand shocks on exporting is overwhelmingly large and beyond the adjustment of the destination, firms may reduce their employment to adjust their production. Therefore, this study presents a standard labor demand model and empirically investigates the effect of demand shocks brought about by political conflict in export markets on domestic employment at the firm level.====Furthermore, little is known about which type of workers firms dismiss when they face an unexpected negative demand shock. This study also investigates this empirical question. Theoretically, we can posit the hypothesis that firms tend to dismiss temporary workers to absorb the negative shock, while they avoid the dismissal of permanent workers for the following two reasons: First, firms are expected to protect permanent workers who have accumulated firm-specific human capital, as discussed in Yokoyama et al. (2019). Second, firms have the incentive to minimize the adjustment cost when they reduce their employment. Thus, given the fact that firing costs for permanent workers are higher than those for temporary workers, firms tend to dismiss temporary workers rather than the permanent ones.====We focus on the behavior of Japanese firms after the 2012 political conflict over the Senkaku islands between Japan and China, which resulted in Chinese consumer boycott of Japanese products. Political conflict is considered an unexpected and exogenous shock that enables us to identify the causal effect as a natural experiment. Although economic relations between Japan and China have deepened over the past three decades, political conflict has been exposed over the territorial rights of the East China Sea islands. The consumer boycotts of Japanese products in China after Japan's nationalization of the Senkaku Islands in September 2012 is the most typical case of political tension affecting bilateral economic relations. To examine how firms respond to such a consumer boycott, we employed the difference-in-differences (DID) technique. We constructed a model for the empirical estimation wherein the treatment group comprised firms exporting to China, which are more susceptible to the demand shock caused by the political conflict than those that do not export to China.====The main findings of this study are threefold. First, we found negative impacts of the political conflict on Japanese firms’ exports and employment. In particular, the intensive margin—measured as the responses of exporting firms that continued to export to China after the shock—is dominant in the decrease in exports and employment. Second, the DID estimates indicated that Japanese firms reallocate their outputs to countries other than China but that this action cannot offset the negative export shock in the Chinese market. Third, we found that firms tend to reduce the number of employees by adjusting the composition of permanent and temporary workers after the demand shock. Specifically, firms with higher export exposure to China experienced a greater reduction in their domestic employment by decreasing their temporary workforce in response to the shock. The results from quantile regressions also reveal that firms in almost all quantiles reduced their temporary workforce following the international conflict. These results suggest that demand shocks in foreign markets transmit to the labor market in Japan.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Japanese firm-level data and presents descriptive statistics on the changes in firms’ exports and employment around the demand shock in China. Section 3 describes empirical specification based on the DID technique. Section 4 examines whether firms reallocate their output to countries other than China to mitigate their negative export shocks.

To control for cross-country differences in the industrial composition, firm size, and firm age distribution, we construct a matched sample using Mahalanobis nearest neighbor matching with respect to these factors. The matched sample supports the finding of existing studies that the median and the standard deviation of profitability are significantly higher in the United States than in Japan. Our matched panel data indicate that this difference arises from both larger firm heterogeneity and more intensive risk-taking in the United States. The sector-by-sector analysis shows that the standard deviation gap is larger in the sectors with more intensive churning in asset-size ranking.","Recent international comparisons of the profitability of large companies show that, for Japanese companies, the median and the standard deviation of profitability—which are measured by the return of assets (ROA), return on equity, or return on sales—are significantly lower than those of other major countries (John et al., 2008; Nakano and Aoki, 2016; Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry 2014; Arikawa et al., 2016; Kagaya and Jinnai, 2016). This finding has provoked a policy debate about the reasons for the low risk-taking and low returns of Japanese companies. The most influential argument is that the stronger protection of employees’ rights (Hirota, 2014) and creditors’ rights through the main-bank governance system (Acharya et al., 2011; King and Wen, 2011; Nguyen, 2011) and the weaker legal protection of shareholders’ rights (John et al., 2008) prevent Japanese companies from taking risks that would allow them to grow faster.====However, a rigorous examination of the argument that Japanese companies are less risky and less profitable has not yet been fully conducted. For example, industrial composition varies significantly by countries. The distributions of firm size and firm age also differ between countries, owing to variation in the levels of stock market development (Fama and French, 2004; Brown and Kapadia, 2007). Further, it remains unclear which component of the standard deviation—either firm heterogeneity or the idiosyncratic factor—is the primary cause of cross-country differences. The former is related more to innovation that results in a productivity gap between companies, whereas the latter is related more to risk-taking by each company. The purpose of this research is to provide a more rigorous cross-country comparison of profitability distributions after controlling for the industrial composition and the distributions of firm size and age.====To this end, we compare the profitability distributions between the United States (US) and Japan using a matched sample for 2005–2014, which is constructed using Mahalanobis nearest neighbor matching with respect to the industrial sector, firm size, and age. We also construct panel data for the matched sample, calculate the risk-taking index proposed by John et al. (2008) for each company with this matched sample, and conduct a cross-country comparison.====We focus on a comparison of the US and Japan because an international comparison of 39 countries conducted by John et al. (2008) indicates a stark contrast between these two countries, with the US companies taking the largest risks and Japanese companies taking the least risks. Despite this difference, the number of publicly traded companies in these countries is comparable and large enough to construct a reasonable matched sample.====The comparison shows that the median and the standard deviation of ROA and the operating cash flow over total assets remain significantly larger for US firms than for Japanese firms in this matched sample, although the difference is smaller than in the unmatched sample. The decomposition of the variation using a random-effects model for the matched panel data shows that both firm heterogeneity and idiosyncratic variation are larger in the US. The firm-level risk-taking index based on John et al. (2008) in the matched panel sample is also larger in the US than in Japan. Thus, our comparison using the matched sample supports the observation that US-listed firms exhibit greater heterogeneity and take more risks than do Japanese companies.====The sector-by-sector analyses show that the standard deviation gap between the US and Japan is higher in the sectors with a higher delisting rate and more intensive churning in the asset-size ranking, including the retail trading sector and the professional, scientific, and technological service sectors, whereas it is smaller in the construction sector and the transportation and warehousing sectors. This is consistent with a casual observation that the former sectors are more exposed to game-changing innovations in online services than are the latter ones.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We describe our data source and sample selection in Section 2. We present a preliminary comparison of profitability using the raw sample before matching in Section 3.

We find that foreign owned establishments and those operating in global markets have higher within-establishment wage dispersion. The effect is over and above the establishment size effect. Furthermore, wages are higher in larger establishments and internationally oriented ones. Our findings are consistent with theories explaining management pay and the scope of control. Our results also provide evidence that can explain the rise in wage inequality due to the emergence of ‘super star’ firms and global supply chains.","In recent years, there has been a fast growing literature documenting the increase in income inequality across the world (Atkinson et al., 2011). An important concern largely ignored by most trade economists is that the gains of globalization have not benefited all in the same way. For instance, Autor et al. (2013) document how import competition from China has contributed to almost 3 million jobs lost in U.S. manufacturing between 2000 and 2010. Goos et al. (2009) show how offshoring has contributed to increased polarization in the U.K. With the emergence of ‘super star’ firms==== operating along global supply chains, increased scale economies related to international trade have likely resulted in increased profits of multinational firms with limited pass-through into prices and wages (Goldbert and Pavcnik, 2016). This is in line with recent evidence showing the increased market power in U.S. listed firms during the last 4 decades (De Loecker and Eeckhout, 2017).====This paper analyzes the role of establishment heterogeneity in rising wage inequality. In particular, there are large differences between establishments in terms of their size and hence profitability even within narrowly defined sectors. Establishments also differ in terms of their participation to international trade or international production networks. We use a new and hitherto unexploited establishment level data set of Korean firms with detailed information on different occupational hierarchies and their wages to analyze how establishment size and exposure to international trade may have contributed to wage dispersion within and across establishments.====A number of papers have studied the sources of wage inequality around the world. One strand of the literature has documented increasing wage inequality due to trade liberalization in both developed and developing economies (Goldberg and Pavcnic, 2007, Verhoogen, 2008). However, the evidence of the impact of trade on inequality for the Korean case seems to be mixed. Kang (2014) studies the impact of trade openness and FDI on the income distribution and finds that trade openness is positively related to income inequality, but negatively related to FDI inflows and outflows. Lee (2017) shows that import competition and technological change contributed to rising wage dispersion within the manufacturing sector over 1980–2012. However, other trade-related measures, such as export intensity and FDI, had no substantial effects on wage inequality. In contrast, Karacaovali and Tabakis (2017) document that a significant part of the aggregate wage inequality persists within different trade-exposure categories in manufacturing and services sectors, suggesting that international trade might not be the main factor to explain the rise in wage dispersion.====Another strand of the literature has studied wage policies that pay out high wages to CEOs as a source of growing earnings inequality. However, as argued by Mueller et al., 2017a, Mueller et al., 2017b, the rise of CEO pay over the past few decades alone cannot explain the increased aggregate wage inequality; CEO pay typically lies well above the 90th percentile, whereas the aggregate rise in inequality is often measured as the 90/10 log wage inequality. Therefore, if wage inequality between different occupations within the firm has also increased,==== then this may be an important factor explaining overall wage inequality in a country. The theoretical literature explaining variation in CEO pay may well be extended as is done by Mueller et al., 2017a, Mueller et al., 2017b to the dispersion in wages between occupations within firms. Gabaix and Landier (2008) show that CEO pay depends on the size of its firm which captures the amount of resources under his control. More talented CEOs are matched with larger firms resulting in a positive relationship between firm size and CEO pay (Terviö, 2008). Hence, if more talented managers are matched with larger firms, we should expect to see a positive relationship between firm size and not only CEO pay, but also with pay of other managers along the hierarchy of the firm.====If the wage dispersion increases with the firm size, then the emergence of ‘super star firms’ that dominate the market in terms of output, employment, and exports can only have contributed to the increased wage dispersion.==== De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) show that market power in the U.S. has been rising over the last four decades due to the increasingly growing role of large and dominant firms resulting in increasing dispersion in profits and a decline in the labor share in the U.S. Budd et al. (2005) have shown that international rent-sharing between affiliate and parent profits of multinational enterprises can indeed contribute to the rising wage inequality, and as production has become increasingly international over the past few decades, this channel has become more important as a driver of observed wage inequality. Similarly we can expect that as the scope of the firm has been growing within the global economy and with increasing technological challenges, the wage dispersion within and across firms has also increased.====In this paper we first document within-establishment wage dispersion that cuts across different hierarchies. We then analyze to what extent the wage dispersion within and across establishments is explained by establishment size and its global nature, both capturing the scope of control required by not only the CEO but also lower management functions. To this end, we consider two proxies that measure the global nature of the establishment: the export intensity and the fraction of foreign owned shareholders.",Wage inequality and establishment heterogeneity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142518301191,9 May 2019,2019,Research Article,104.0

Based on the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions, the poverty rate of Japanese children aged under 18 was 13.9 percent in 2015. This number decreased by 2.4 percentage points from that in 2012, but it is still high compared to other OECD countries. People’s childhood poverty can affect their life course in adulthood through various paths, such as education and health.==== Aware of the importance of this problem, the Japanese government enacted the Act on Promotion of Development and Support for Children and Young People in 2009, and the Law on Measures to Counter Child Poverty in 2013. Based on the latter law, the general framework to counter child poverty listed education supports as a primary near-term policy action. Before these actions of the central government, Japanese local governments had implemented educational support polices without subsidies from the central government, and they attracted some support from the private sector (Sakuma, 2017). After the enforcement of the Law on Measures to Counter Child Poverty, the municipality, which provided the sample used in this study, developed a new plan, named, Project for the Future.====Educational supports, including remedial education, targeting underachieving students or those in poor socio-economic environments, have been implemented around the world to satisfy minimum academic standards, and they attract much attention.==== While randomized trials are often used to evaluate their effectiveness in developing countries (e.g., Banerjee et al., 2007; Kremer et al., 2013; Saavedra et al., 2017), much research in developed countries depends on observational data sets. For primary or secondary education, the short-term improvement in academic achievement is often detected through data set research (e.g., García-Pérez and Hidalgo-Hidalgo, 2017; Machin et al., 2004; Lavy and Schlosser, 2005). Moreover, Lavy et al. (2018) have found that the long-term positive effect of such academic improvement lasts in adulthood. The literature on remedial education for underprepared students in colleges or universities provides mixed results: some find positive effects (e.g., Bettinger and Long, 2009), and others do not (e.g., Martorell and McFarlin, 2011; De Paola and Scoppa, 2014; Duchini, 2017).====Not only is remedial education employed to satisfy minimum standards but increasing instructional time has been examined in the literature as well. Recent studies have detected positive but not large effects (e.g., Lavy, 2015). In a Japanese case, Kikuchi (2014) reported that the reduction of instructional time in junior high schools decreased the probability to enroll in high school. Furthermore, the effects of instructional time may depend on subjects (e.g., Bellei, 2009; Zimmer et al., 2010; Battistin and Meroni, 2016), may be non-linear (e.g., Lavy, 2015; García-Pérez and Hidalgo-Hidalgo, 2017) and may be dependent on the circumstances of families, schools, and classrooms (e.g., Bellei, 2009; Rivkin and Schiman, 2015) as well as on what and how instructors teach in extended time (Huebener et al., 2017).====The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of remedial education programs provided by Adachi ward in Tokyo metropolitan area in Japan for third and fourth graders in selected public elementary schools. The socio-economic situations of children in this municipality are generally challenging. For example, the shares of those who receive public financial assistance for school costs are well above the national mean: the share in Adachi was 35.8% while the national mean was 15.7% in FY2013, according to the figures provided by the municipality. The performance for the National Assessments of Academic Ability (the nationally standardized test) are the same as or a little higher than the national mean for sixth graders, but lower for ninth graders. The municipality’s Board of Education has responded by promoting various types of policies to improve educational environments, including allocation of additional support teacher to classrooms; improvement of lunch quality; promotion of partnership among kindergartens, elementary and middle schools; and development of partnerships between universities and education board. The remedial education programs are positioned among these policies and are provided for students in public elementary and junior high schools after school hours, during weekends, and during vacations in summer, winter, and spring. This paper evaluates the effects of one of these remedial education programs for third and fourth graders, one that determines the basic contents that second graders should master before being promoted to the third grade. We constructed a panel data set of individual students.====The contribution of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the remedial education programs designed by a local government for elementary school students, controlling the socio-economic status of each student using a student-level panel data set. Our data is constructed from the administrative data that the Adachi ward office stores. Note that, although the Japanese local governments have rich individual-level data on students and schools, such data are not fully exploited for policy evaluation. In fact, the municipal office itself examined the effects of these remedial education programs using test scores just before and after the classes, but this paper utilizes the results of “Adachi Comprehensive Survey of Acquisition of Basic Academic Skills,” comparing between the participants and non-participants of remedial education programs. This Survey is held once a year for all public elementary schools in this municipality and includes the standardized tests on Japanese language arts and mathematics as well as students’ attitude surveys. Although such remediation programs are implemented in many schools in other regions, the evaluation of their effectiveness has been superficial.====This paper employs an instrumental variable based on variation in placement policies of schools to control selection biases in order to estimate value-added to student achievement. Our estimation results indicate that the remedial education programs have positive effects on test scores of Japanese language arts by 0.13 of a standard deviation, while no statistically significant effect was found for mathematics test scores. The positive effects on test scores of Japanese language arts are not particularly larger for those who failed to satisfy a standard in the third grade than for those who passed. The results suggest that the participants increased awareness of the importance of study and hours needed for study as well.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 focuses on a review of the existing literature; Section 3 introduces the institutional background of the study; Section 4 presents the data; the econometric specifications are described in Section 5; Sample statistics are shown in Section 6; the estimation results are reported in Section 7; Section 8 offers conclusions for the study.",Evaluating remedial education in elementary schools: Administrative data from a municipality in Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142519300076,2 May 2019,2019,Research Article,105.0

Using data pertaining to South Korean firms from 2002 to 2013, we find that peer firms belonging to ==== that have favorable ratings tend to invest more than control firms do, suggesting that a peer effect exists in terms of credit ratings. Also, the result is primarily observed when firms with inflated ratings are industry leaders. This finding is consistent with the assertion that the peer effect of high-profile firms is relatively larger. An additional test shows that the degree of rating favorableness affects peer investment decisions. Specifically, small or large differences do not affect peers’ investments. Taken together, our findings have academic and practical implications, in that they demonstrate the impact of inflated ratings on real corporate decisions.","This study analyzes the effect of inflated credit ratings on peer firms’ investments. The inflation of credit ratings has been pointed out as a major cause of financial failures, including the financial crisis of 2007. Prior literature has expressed concern that overgenerous ratings may enable negative investments to get funded by misleading investors (Jiang et al., 2012; Cornaggia and Cornaggia, 2013). Goldstein and Huang (2017) support this by showing that firms with relatively high financial costs can invest in negative NPV projects with high upside potential due to inflated ratings. However, given that not all firms are rated by credit rating agencies (CRAs) and that firms make investment decisions considering peer information, there is a possibility that the negative effect of overly optimistic ratings may not be limited to rated companies (Badertscher et al., 2013). Whether a firm’s rating is related to other firms’ investments is a crucial research question because investment decisions based on inflated ratings can be extended to the entire economy. In this study, we use Korean public firms and examine whether favorable ratings are associated with the investments of peer firms.====Korean credit ratings are appropriate to test this association for several reasons. First, only a small number of Korean firms have ratings, increasing the likelihood that the ratings are used as peer information of other companies.==== Second, issuer-pays, a compulsory multiple rating system, and high dependence on rating fees can contribute to the rating inflation of Korean firms. Third, some Korean companies have both domestic and foreign credit ratings. This enables us to evaluate the extent to which Korean CRAs favor firms, because global CRAs are free of rating inflation pressure and tend to rate corporations objectively in emerging countries (Ferri and Liu, 2003). Criticism of Korean CRAs is easily found, as shown in the following newspaper article.====Korean credit rating agencies are under fire for giving “overly favorable” assessments to domestic companies. There are many companies, including Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, KT, SK Telecom, S-Oil and POSCO, whose credit ratings assessed by Korean agencies are six notches or higher than those given out by internationally recognized agencies such as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), and Fitch. GS Caltex shows the biggest gap of eight places, raising questions about how seriously investors should take Korean agencies’ evaluations into consideration when making decisions, according to CEO Score, a business consulting firm that compared 33 Korean firms’ credit ratings suggested by major agencies at home and abroad… Park Joo-keun, president of CEO Score, pointed out the limited freedom of domestic rating agencies in terms of evaluations of Korean companies. “These agencies make a living from the fees Korean companies pay in exchange for having their credit rates evaluated,” he said. “In this income structure, they may feel pressured to give some favors to their clients.”====This article explains the Korean credit rating environment as being under rating inflation pressure from large corporations, including business group affiliations. Ferri and Liu (2003) show the possibility of overly favorable ratings in Korea by reporting the serious decline in non-bank corporate credit ratings, not a quick response to the recovery in the sovereign rating. Kim et al. (2017) support this by providing empirical evidence that lower earnings quality is associated with larger rating differences between Korean and global CRAs. This may be the result of companies whose foreign ratings do not meet their expectations exerting pressure on domestic CRAs. In this respect, these inflated credit ratings, which can be observed as the difference between Korean and global CRAs, provide a unique research setting to investigate their impact on peer firms’ investment decisions.====Although most research assumes that corporate decision making is independent of peer firms, peer effect studies demonstrate its existence in various aspects, such as stock splits and capital structure (e.g., Kaustia and Rantala, 2015; Leary and Roberts, 2014).==== In addition to this, Graham and Harvey (2001) use a survey approach and show that managers consider the actions of peer firms in financing decisions. In particular, prior studies report that corporate investments are affected by peers’ fraudulent financial reporting and valuations (Beatty et al., 2013; Foucault and Fresard, 2014).====Two strands of research explain how favorable ratings can increase peers’ investments. First, firms tend to mimic other firms’ investments (Scharfstein and Stein, 1990). Inflated ratings are likely to reduce the cost of debt, leading to more investment among rated firms (Kim and Jeong, 2016). Considering the herd behavior inherent in investment, this may result in increases in peers’ investments (Scharfstein and Stein, 1990). A second line of research shows that financial misreporting increases peers’ investments by suggesting rosy industry prospects (Beatty et al., 2013; Li, 2016). Firms trying to maintain or upgrade their ratings tend to engage in income-increasing earnings management (Choe and Shin, 2006). If overvalued credit ratings stem from low earnings quality (Kim et al., 2017), they can contribute to peers’ investments. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that peers belonging to an industry where some firms have favorable domestic ratings will tend to invest more.====In this study, we use 16,090 Korean public firm-years from 2002 to 2013 and investigate the impact of favorable ratings on peers’ investments. Our sample consists of 2248 peers, defined as bearing the same three-digit Korean Standard Industrial Classification (KSIC) code of favorably rated firms, and 13,842 control firms. The followings are the results of the study. First, consistent with our prediction, we find significantly greater investments by peers relative to control firms. Second, we predict and find that the peer influence is greater when industry leaders have favorable credit ratings. This implies, as observed in Beatty et al. (2013)—who report that fraudulent financial reporting by high-profile firms affects industry peers’ investments—that leading companies play an important role in the formation of industry market expectations. Third, we examine whether peers’ investments are different according to the degree of favorableness, and find that the peer effect does not exist in those samples with extremely small or large differences between Korean and global CRAs while it does exist in samples with median differences. This suggests that peers consider the degree of overvaluation when they make investment decisions. Fourth, we investigate whether peers’ investments are associated with future operating cash flows, to examine the contribution of peers’ investments to firm value. Related to this, we find that the impact of peers’ investments on firm value is not different from that of control firms, indicating that peers’ investment decision-making is likely not optimal. Finally, our results remain robust after excluding firm-years with only global credit ratings.====This study contributes to the literature as follows. First, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate peer effects in terms of credit ratings. Moreover, the findings of this study suggest that peers’ investments due to favorable ratings do not contribute to firm value. The results offer a basis for the assertion that there is a need to monitor domestic CRAs strictly and to motivate investors to pay heed to firms with large differences between their domestic and global ratings. As argued by Ferri and Liu (2003), upgrading domestic CRAs can improve global ratings by prompting global CRAs to gather more information.====Second, this study extends the credit rating literature by using firms with both domestic and global ratings. While the controversy regarding inflated ratings continues, there is little empirical evidence of their effects on real decision-making, as there are practical difficulties in identifying whether ratings are inflated. This study overcomes this limitation by using data from the South Korean business environment, where global ratings as an objective criterion exist in tandem with domestic ratings. We believe that this study’s new approach can be helpful in future research related to credit ratings.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to achieve a desirable procurement contract in PFIs. In the first part, we develop an incomplete contracting model to analyze the effectiveness of PFIs. We show that an appropriate fixed compensation is important in disentangling adverse selection. In the second part, we test the validity of this theoretical implication by case study of “Thalasso Fukuoka” and by cross-sectional analysis on Japan’s PFIs. The case study indicates that adverse selection under overestimated value for money (VFM) was a major reason for why the project failed. The cross-sectional analysis also shows that when the local government had overestimated the initial VFM, adverse selection discouraged private companies with higher reservation profits to apply for the project. It suggests that the overestimated initial VFM could make the project less productive even if it did not lead the project to bankrupcy.","Private finance initiative (PFI) is a way of creating ""public–private partnerships"" (PPPs) where private firms are contracted to complete and manage public projects.==== After enactment of the “PFI Law” in 1999, the number of PFI projects has been increasing in Japan. Under PFIs, the private specific purpose company (SPC), instead of the government, handles the up-front costs. Under current severe fiscal conditions of national and local governments, PFIs are expected to promote necessary social capital investment more efficiently.==== However, the effectiveness of PFIs has been controversial both among practitioners and scholars. In particular, finding the optimal procurement contracts between public and private agents is a fundamental issue in complex environments.====The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to achieve a desirable procurement contract between public and private agents. In PFIs, value for money (VFM) has been the most important criterion to evaluate the performance. It has frequently been argued that giving scope for better management of the risk associated with projects and more effective exploitation of opportunities, PFIs would offer a prospect of delivering the services required by public sector clients in a way that provides superior VFM than conventional procurement. VFM is a cost-based approach that is measured mainly from the viewpoint of fiscal burdens.==== In the approach, the government first estimates PSC (Public Sector Comparator) which is the hypothetical LCC (Life Cycle Cost) when building and operating the facility. It then estimates PFI’s LCC which is the LCC when a private SPC would build and operate the facility and get profit. Comparing these estimates leads to VFM which is equal to (PSC - PFI’s LCC)/PSC (see Fig. 1).====However, when estimating the PFI’s LCC, the government imposes several restrictive assumptions on how much the SPC’s profit would be and to what extent the SPC could save the costs (see, for example, Coulson (2008) and Demirag and Khadaroo (2011)). More importantly, it implicitly assumes that the procurement contract entails no agency cost. However, PFIs have a principal-agent problem because the principal (= the government) delegates an action to agent (= private company). In general, the principal cannot verify how the agent will behave. Thus if the interests of the principal diverge from that of the agent, the outcome of the PFI is less desirable than the principal expects because it may incur agency costs such as adverse selection or moral hazard.====In the first part of this paper, we develop an incomplete contracting model to analyze the effectiveness of PFIs. In the model, we analyze the choices of contractual modes when a PFI project is plagued with adverse selection. We show that an appropriate fixed compensation is important in disentangling adverse selection. In the second part, we test the validity of this theoretical implication by case study of “Thalasso Fukuoka” and by cross-sectional analysis on Japan’s PFIs. The case study is worthwhile to be noted because it was the first PFI project that went bankrupt in Japan. It indicates that adverse selection under overestimated VFM was a major reason for why the project failed. The cross-sectional analysis also reveals that when the local government had overestimated the initial VFM, adverse selection discouraged private companies with higher reservation profits to apply for the project. It suggests that the overestimated initial VFM could make the project less productive even if it did not lead the project to bankrupcy.====In literature, Hart et al. (1997) and Hart (2003) are seminal studies that developed an incomplete contracting model to analyze the effectiveness of PFIs. Iossa and Martimort (2015) extended the model to the case where the outcome of the project was uncertain. However, since they imposed an implicit assumption that the private agents are intrinsically homogeneous, the public procurement was not plagued with adverse selection in their models. A key contribution of our paper is to show that when private agents are heterogeneous, low fixed compensation reflected as high initial VFM could be a source of adverse selection in the PFI contract. In particular, we find that when the government neglects the agency costs and evaluate initial VFM optimistically, it could conclude an inappropriate procurement contract which leads to adverse selection under which only private companies with lower reservation profits would be involved with the project.====There are several empirical studies that explored determinants of VFMs in Japan. Shimono and Maeno (2010) investigated how the initial VFM estimates were revised when the project contract was concluded. Yodo et al. (2016) showed that the VFM depends on the fields and the contractual structures of the projects. However, since they assumed that the government had always evaluated VFM appropriately, achieving higher VFM was regarded as the ultimate policy goal in the discussions. Our paper, in contrast, assumes that the government frequently overestimates VFM when deciding its PFI policy. Thus optimistic estimates of initial VFM would discourage good companies to apply for the project and might lead to relatively small VFM when selecting the private company (= SPC).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains basic framework of the model and discusses desirable compensation scheme. Section 3 provides case study of “Thalasso Fukuoka” where low fixed compensation might have resulted in its failure because it had discouraged good companies to apply for the project. Section 4 shows cross-sectional evidence that overestimated initial VFM might have caused adverse selection where only small unlisted companies had an incentive to run the facilities in Japan’s PFIs.

Using a panel dataset of 54 developing economies over the period 1980 to 2015 (30 of which have IT frameworks), we re-visit the rather controversial issue of whether adoption of an IT framework leads to superior outcomes in terms of reducing inflation and its variability. After controlling for potential endogeneity and self-selection concerns of policy adoption, our main empirical finding is that IT frameworks appear to reduce inflation rates in developing economies regardless of the level of financial development, while it reduces variability of inflation rates only when we control for levels of financial market development. We further find that the effectiveness of IT framework on inflation is highly dependent on financial inclusion and bank characteristics, while the effect on inflation variability is more associated with components of capital market development.","The global decline in inflation rates along with the “Great Moderation” of the business cycles since the 1990s till 2007 was attributed partly to the adoption of inflation targeting (IT) framework as a monetary policy strategy by many advanced economies (Schmidt-Hebbel, 2008). Inspired by this, a number of developing economies followed suit, choosing to adopt a formal inflation target as a nominal anchor and interest rates as the main monetary policy instrument of choice as they move towards greater exchange rate flexibility.==== Having been pioneered by New Zealand in 1989 and adopted soon after by a few advanced economies such as Canada and United Kingdom, IT frameworks have gained widespread popularity among global central banks over the last few decades. According to the IMF (2016), as of October 2016, 38 economies had officially adopted IT framework (10 advanced economies and the rest developing economies). Prominent recent examples of economies jumping onto the IT bandwagon include India in early 2015 and Argentina in 2017.====Despite their undoubted popularity, IT frameworks have come under some criticism following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the ensuing “Great Recession” due to their seeming narrowness and inability to adequately deal with concerns about financial risks and imbalances and the breakdown in the interest rate policy transmission during that period. As Martin Wolf of the ==== has forcefully noted: “Over almost three decades policymakers and academics became ever more confident that they had found, in inflation targeting, the holy grail of fiat…money...Now we see it was a mirage..” (Wolf, 2009).==== More specifically, Svennson, (2010a) has noted that “…financial factors may have a very strong and deteriorating effect on the transmission mechanism, making standard interest-rate policy much less effective…A better theoretical, empirical and operations understanding of the role of financial factors in the transmission mechanism is urgently required..” (pp.5 and 8).====These concerns should ring particularly true in developing economies where inflation may, at times, be driven by supply side pressures (such as domestic food inflation) and the interest rate policy transmission channel may not work effectively even in normal periods (Agenor and DA Silva, 2013; Walsh, 2009). In particular, at a basic level, the interest rate policy transmission channel works in two stages. The first stage of interest rate pass-through (IRPT) refers to changes in the policy rates to interbank rates to market rates.==== For this stage to work well it is important that: (a) there needs to be a degree of domestic bank competition (along with interest rate deregulation) so that changes in policy rates transmit to interbank rates and retail bank lending and deposit rates; and (b) there must exist a reasonably well-developed government bond markets such that policy rates impact other short-term paper rates and longer-term bond yields, thus influencing aggregate demand and inflation (see Gopalan and Rajan, 2017).====Even if these preconditions -- i.e. degree of financial market development -- exist for the first stage of interest pass-through to work, interest rates may not be an effective policy instrument if a large segment of the population does not have access to the formal financial system and is not impacted directly by bank interest rate changes (Mehrotra and Yetman, 2015). Thus, for the second stage of IRPT to operate effectively it is important that there be a fairly high degree of domestic financial inclusion.====In addition, the interest rate transmission channel can be influenced by bank characteristics (Kashyap and Stein, 2000; Gambacorta, 2005; Ashcraft, 2006; Brissimis et al., 2014). The related literature has found that the interest rate channel tends to be weak for banks with higher liquidity, capitalization and profitability. As Brissimis et al. (2014) argue, banks with greater market power tend to have higher profitability and easier access to alternative sources of finance. Hence they are less reliant on central bank funding and less sensitive to changes in the marginal cost of loan production when monetary policy changes, as is true for foreign banks that can obtain funding from parent company via cross-border internal funds transfer (Gopalan and Rajan, 2017). The interest rate channel can also be enhanced by the imperfect substitutability between loans and securities in bank portfolios and the borrowing for firms (Bernanke and Blinder, 1988). Higher degree of asset substitutability weakens the channels of monetary policy transmission through banks.====The effects of IT frameworks on inflation and inflation variability conditioned on financial development are therefore the particular focus of this paper using a panel of 54 developing economies over the period 1980 to 2015, 30 of which have adopted an IT framework. Specifically, the paper re-examines whether the adoption of an IT framework leads to attainment of superior macroeconomic outcomes in terms of reducing the rate of inflation as well as its variability after accounting for the possibility that a country’s choice of IT regime may be non-random, as well as accounting for the so-called dynamic bias problem ==== Brito and Bystedt (2010). Unlike the existing IT literature, we explicitly take into account the role of financial development.====We use a new broad-based index of financial development developed by Svirydzenka (2016) as well as its six components that summarize how developed financial institutions and financial markets are in terms of their depth, access, and efficiency. While financial markets mainly refer to capital markets (equities and bonds), financial institutions include banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds. With regard to the financial institutions components, we expect to find that IT frameworks tend to be more effective if individuals/firms in an economy have better access to formal financial institutions (i.e. higher financial institutions access) and more transactions associated with the formal financial institutions (i.e. higher financial institutions depth). With regard to financial markets components, their effects on IT frameworks effectiveness can be mixed since financial markets include both stock and bond markets in Svirydzenka (2016)’s definition. As stated earlier, for the interest rate channel to work we need a reasonably well-developed government bond markets so that policy rates can pass-through to other short-term paper rates and longer-term bond yields. However, greater access to stock and bond markets may also suggest a higher degree of asset substitutability between loans and securities, indicating a weak interest rate transmission channel through banks. Therefore, the effects of financial markets components on inflation of IT frameworks remain unclear.====While one would expect a priori that IT frameworks in more financially developed economies to be successful in managing inflation, their impact on inflation variability is ambiguous. On the one hand, greater levels of financial sector development allow the central bank to use interest rates more effectively to manage the inflation rate and its variability. In addition, if financial development involves enhanced access to finance and financial inclusion, this will allow for greater consumption-smoothing so the central bank can focus more on inflation as opposed to output stabilization, thus facilitating lower and more stable inflation rates (Mehrotra and Yetman, 2015).==== On the other hand, an IT targeting central bank may be less inclined to manage exchange rate variability as agents can hedge against such risks, which in turn may impart higher domestic price variability. In addition, greater financial inclusion could allow agents to hedge against inflation shocks, thus granting central banks more leeway to operate wider inflation target bands to deal with other objectives such as output and financial stability.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section offers a brief review of the literature. Section 2 summarizes the data sources and definitions. Section 3 outlines the model and estimation strategy. Section 4 discusses the results.

This paper provides empirical evidence of the relationship between demographics and interest rates over a wide sample of advanced and emerging market economies. It also finds that capital account openness limits the direct sensitivity of a country's interest rates to its own demographics. The results suggest that future demographic developments will continue to apply downward pressure on the interest rates in Asia which foresees a rapid aging.,"Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), long-term bond yields have declined significantly in Europe and the United States. A similar trend is observed in Asia, particularly in Australia and Korea, where the decline has been nearly as large. The accommodative monetary policies (both conventional and unconventional) that were put in place in response to the GFC are an important force behind these low real rates. However, a closer look at the longer-term trend reveals that these rates have been on a decline for more than two decades across many countries, suggesting factors other than accommodative monetary policies are at play.====The growing literature on secular stagnation has identified several factors behind the observed decline in interest rate trends. Summers (2014), Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014) and Gordon (2016) ascribe it to structural factors that have led to a persistent imbalance between demand for investment and supply of savings. These include—adverse demographic developments, a falling price of investment, lower productivity growth, savings glut, scarcity of safe assets and increasing wealth and income inequality. The GFC added further downward pressure on interest rates due to its impact on investment demand, productivity and supply of safe assets. As the global economy is moving toward recovery, the adverse effects of some of these forces are expected to decline. However, structural factors, most notably lower productivity growth and demographic developments are likely to keep real interest rates low for a long time.====In this paper, we focus on the impact of demographic trends, which due to its high persistence are likely to continue to push interest rates down in the medium term. Despite the growing interest in this topic, so far only a few papers have empirically investigated the role of demographic factors on real interest rates (Aksoy et al., 2015, Favero and Galasso, 2016, Ferrero et al., 2017). Moreover, existing studies focus on either the OECD countries or the euro area. The objective of our paper is to provide new evidence on the relation between demographic trends and real interest rates over a larger sample of countries covering advanced and emerging-market economies, and explore its implications on Asian countries. Further, unlike earlier papers, we take into account the role of financial integration while assessing the impact of demographics on interest rates.====Our results indicate that demographic trends are likely to put downward pressure on real interest rates for most major countries in Asia. These direct effects are however likely to be less important for countries that are financially open. For financially open economies that are well integrated into global markets, changes in the world interest rate—which may in turn be driven by global aging trends—will likely matter more than local demographics. Globally or locally, demographic trends may lower the natural rate of interest and thereby narrow the scope for central banks to achieve price stability and maintain output at its potential. In addition, to the extent that demographic factors affect the medium-term trends in nominal and real interest rates, they may also pose risks to financial stability which calls for a strong macro-prudential framework to be put in place.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 begins with a description of trends in long-term real interest rates as well as estimated natural interest rates in major Asian economies. We then look at demographic trends in Asia, present theoretical priors, and discuss empirical literature on the link between demographic variables and interest rates. Section 3 outlines the empirical model and estimation results, including forward-looking assessments based on population projections. Finally, we conclude in Section 4 with policy implication for financial stability and the conduct of monetary policy.",Demographics and interest rates in Asia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142518301142,1 April 2019,2019,Research Article,109.0

Our bivariate probit estimation results show that people influenced by status-quo bias or risk aversion tend to have significantly lower probability of supporting both foreign workers and imports. Individuals opposing foreign workers tend to have pessimistic views of the national economy's prospects and no personal acquaintance with foreigners. We also confirm the effects of standard variables, such as education and occupation. These findings suggest that wide-ranging measures are required for expanding support for foreign workers.","Economists almost unanimously support free trade in goods and services, but controversies continue when we discuss the immigration issue, as surveyed by Peri (2016). In the real world, many countries control immigrants and foreign workers at national borders. Immigration control is among the hotly debated issues in many developed countries, including the U.K., as illustrated in the so-called Brexit referendum on exiting the EU, and the U.S., as shown by US President Donald Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican border in the presidential election in 2016. In contrast to these other developed countries, Japan maintains extremely tight regulations on immigration, but its rapidly declining working-age population has led the country to drastically relax the control of foreign workers in 2018. This study examines the impacts of orthodox economic factors as well as behavioral biases on individual attitudes toward foreign workers based on a survey of more than 10,000 respondents in Japan.====Workers often oppose inflows of foreigners due to threatened employment opportunities and/or lower wages in the domestic labor market. Empirical analyses confirming these effects include Borjas (2003) in the U.S. and Felbermayr et al. (2010) in Germany, to name just a few. However, Hainmueller et al. (2015) revisit this issue by conducting a survey of U.S. employees in 12 diverse industries and cast doubt on the effect of labor market competition on attitudes toward immigration. Accumulated studies in economics, as reviewed in the next section, have confirmed that narrowly defined economic self-interest is insufficient for explaining individual attitudes, but possible explanations suggested by research in other social science fields are so diverse.====To explore economic factors outside of the labor market, we introduce behavioral biases into our analysis. Behavioral economics has successfully explained anomalies in various economic fields, such as finance and consumption, but the application to international economics has so far been limited, to the best knowledge of the authors.==== Based on Japanese survey data, Tomiura et al. (2016) find that individuals’ status-quo bias and risk aversion are significantly related with opposition to import liberalization, but their analyses are on trade protection, not foreign workers or immigration. As anti-immigrant sentiments might be more easily influenced by psychological factors than trade protectionism, the investigation of possible impacts of behavioral biases should be useful in our context. This study examines whether the individual's behavioral biases affect her/his opinion about foreign workers after controlling for standard economic factors, such as occupation and industry. As individual attitudes toward immigrants or foreign workers are likely to be correlated with trade policy preferences, this study analyzes them jointly in a bivariate model.====This study derives data from a survey on 10,816 respondents in Japan. The share of foreigners in the total population has persistently been extremely low in Japan, partly as a result of its long history of tight control of foreign workers and immigrants.==== However, as the working-age population continues to shrink (it has decreased by around 10 million during the last two decades)==== owing to rapid aging and low fertility, the Japanese government has recently deregulated some important restrictions on foreign workers. Although Japanese firms have actively introduced robots to manufacturing sites, the labor shortage has recently become widespread to non-manufacturing sectors. As the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence in interactive inter-personal jobs remains to be seen, Japanese industries demand more foreign workers. Therefore, our research has deep implications for ongoing policy discussions in many countries.====The results of this study show that individuals opposing both foreign workers and imports tend to be influenced by status-quo bias or risk aversion. We confirm significant effects of behavioral biases even after controlling for standard variables, such as individual's education, occupation, income, age, and gender. This suggests that traditional economic measures, such as income compensation, are insufficient for expanding political support for globalization, especially for resisting anti-immigration movements. Policy makers should take into account individuals’ behavioral biases in presenting a reform proposal.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related previous research.

Using quarterly firm-level data, we find that the adjustment of working capital was weaker during the crisis. Moreover, the negative relationship between excess working capital and firm performance became more significant during the crisis, especially for larger firms. However, this crisis-related working capital–firm performance effect does not appear to persist for very long, because to finance any excess working capital, firms borrow from banks and reduce their internal cash both during and outside periods of crisis.","In this paper, we investigate how the level of working capital deviated from the target level of firms during the recent global financial crisis. We also examine how firms mitigated any excess working capital following the crisis over time. In general, working capital consists of trade receivables, inventories, and trade payables. During the global financial crisis, the level of working capital increased for the following reasons. First, with the rapid decline in firm sales, the level of firm inventories became unexpectedly excessive. Second, as many firm customers began to experience economic distress, they delayed payment for goods and services. This accounted for an increase in unpaid trade receivables. Third, with the decline in firm sales during the crisis, the purchase of goods also decreased, leading to a decline in trade payables (Tsuruta and Uchida, 2013). Lastly, the increase in the probability of default during the economic downturn led to a decline in the supply of trade payables (Raddatz, 2010, Boissay and Gropp, 2013). For the most part, firms finance their excess working capital using their available financing sources. However, if the credit constraints for firms are severe, carrying excess working capital can diminish firm performance because firms are obliged to use relatively expensive sources of finance. Therefore, firms should adjust the level of working capital toward some firm-specific target level during and after periods of crisis.====Using Japanese quarterly firm-level data, we investigate the following issues. First, following previous studies (Kieschnick et al., 2013, Baños-Caballero et al., 2013), we estimate the target level of working capital for firms. Then, using this model, we predict the level of excess working capital found in firms during the global financial crisis after 2008. Second, using the estimation method introduced by Flannery and Rangan (2006) and Baños-Caballero et al. (2013), we estimate the adjustment speed of working capital during the crisis. As these studies argue, firms adjust their level of working capital toward the target level. As a result, if firms quickly mitigate the excess in working capital resulting from the crisis, it should not affect them greatly. However, if the adjustment speed slows during the crisis period, then carrying excess working capital can be harmful to firm performance. Third, we investigate the empirical relationship between excess working capital and firm performance (in terms of profitability). If excess working capital is indeed harmful to firm performance, the estimated empirical relationship should be negative.====Japanese data are especially suitable for the study of working capital management during the recent crisis. First, the real shock of the crisis was especially great for Japanese firms as the real growth rate of GDP fell from 2.2% in fiscal year (FY) 2007 to –1.0% in 2008 and –5.5% in 2009. This was much more severe than in comparable developed countries.==== Second, our data include many small businesses, which are typically financially constrained (Berger and Udell, 1998). Excess working capital is an especially important consideration for small businesses, so using this information, we can investigate the negative effects of working capital during the shock more precisely. In addition, public credit guarantees increased in Japan during the crisis period for small businesses, so the estimation results including small businesses have rich policy implications. Finally, our data are quarterly (not yearly), so we can examine the periods of working capital adjustment in finer detail.====Our results are as follows. First, the level of excess working capital increased during the financial crisis after 2008. After late 2009, the level decreased and returned to its pre-crisis level. Second, the adjustment speed of working capital requirements in late 2008 and early 2009 was slower than that in other periods. This suggests that firms faced some constraints in adjusting their working capital levels to their target values during the financial crisis. Conversely, the adjustment speed after late 2009 was similar to that before the crisis, so firms could adjust their working capital requirements only a year after the first occurrence of the financial crisis. Third, the estimated negative relationship between firm performance and excess working capital requirements was stronger during the crisis. This implies that firms were unable to reduce their working capital during the crisis period. As firms financed excess working capital during both the crisis and noncrisis periods with bank loans and internal cash, this negative effect results from real not just financial factors. Finally, the negative effects of excess working capital and the slow speed of working capital adjustment were more severe for larger firms.====In terms of related work, Hill et al. (2010) estimate the determinants of working capital requirements and show that growing firms, firms facing costly external finance, and financially distressed firms all invest less in working capital. In contrast, firms with high internal finance capacity and high credit availability invest more in working capital. Elsewhere, many extant studies (for example, Deloof, 2003, Kieschnick et al., 2013, Baños-Caballero et al., 2014, Aktas et al., 2015) estimate the relationship between working capital management and corporate performance and demonstrate that because both high and low levels of working capital have negative effects on firm performance, there is an optimal level of working capital. In other work, Baños-Caballero et al. (2013) estimate a partial adjustment model and show that the speed of adjustment of working capital is faster if firms have bargaining power and their external financing constraints are not severe. However, all of these studies investigate the effects of a financial crisis on working capital management in noncrisis periods. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between firm performance and working capital and the adjustment speed of working capital during a particular crisis period, which represents our main contribution to the corporate finance literature.====Our paper is related to the literature that investigates the effects of the global financial crisis on the Japanese economy. Focusing on the loan market, Kitamura et al. (2016) investigate interest rate pass-through using bank-based panel data from Japan. They show that banks lowered loan interest rates by raising pass-through after the financial crisis. Uchino (2013) focuses on the effects of collapse of the corporate bond market during the financial crisis, and shows that Japanese firms substituted bank loans for public debt. Focusing on the Japanese labor market during the financial crisis, Hijzen et al. (2015) analyze the employment dynamics during the global financial crisis in Japan and investigate the adjustment behavior of business establishments. All of these studies focus on the adjustment behavior of Japanese firms and how they responded to the financial crisis. However, none of them concerns the adjustment behavior in working capital of Japanese firms during the crisis, so our paper makes a significant contribution to the literature on the Japanese economy.====Outside this literature, some studies (for example, Love et al., 2007, Garcia-Appendini and Montoriol-Garriga, 2013, Casey and O’Toole, 2014, Carbó-Valverde et al., 2016) focus on periods of financial crisis and the impact on the relationship between trade credit policy and the supply of bank loans, while Almeida et al. (2012) investigate the effects on firm investment. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of a financial crisis on firm performance using quarterly firm-level data including small businesses.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and provides an overview of the data during the sample period. Section 3 examines the determinants of working capital requirements and the levels of excess working capital during the crisis period. Section 4 introduces our partial adjustment model and discusses the estimation results.

Our results suggest that more clustering trades are associated with greater resemblance of a random walk, less pricing errors, and shorter price delays. Moreover, we examine three underlying mechanisms to explain how clustering improves efficiency. First, we show that clustering trades are informative, consistent with the idea that stealth traders leverage such tactics to convey ","Trade-size clustering (clustering thereafter) on certain values prevails in financial markets, such as equity markets (Alexander and Peterson, 2007), foreign exchange markets (Moulton, 2005), index futures markets (Ap Gwilym and Meng, 2010), and swaps markets (Meng et al., 2013). One of prominent explanations for this phenomenon is due to the stealth trading hypothesis (Barclay and Warner, 1993) where informed traders hide their activities by breaking up large orders into small and similar sizes (Kyle, 1985). Motivated by this conjecture, empirical evidence is found to support that medium-sized (small-sized) rounded transactions are abused by stealth traders to disguise private information (Alexander and Peterson, 2007; O’Hara et al., 2014). Given the above reasoning, more clustering trades seem to create a favorable backdrop against which information is incorporated swiftly into prices by informed investors, hence contributing to price efficiency.====There is another line of literature suggesting that liquidity is a key consideration for investors to place trades. Compared to prices and immediacies, attention is seldom paid to the quantity in a presumed liquid market where participants can trade whatever they want. However, frictional markets compel traders to compromise on one of these dimensions regarding liquidity. In light of Hodrick and Moulton (2009), quantity is equally important when uninformed investors with heterogeneous beliefs wish to pursue a high level of satisfaction. Besides, informed investors likewise capitalize on precise sizes to trade, which is evidenced by Blau et al., (2012). In their study, short sellers with information about future prices are shown to cluster less on round sizes. If it is true to some extent, less clustering trades from the informed help include information into prices and thus improve price efficiency.====Given these two mixed and clashing predictions, it is indispensable for us to look into whether clustering trades matter to informational efficiency, the extent to which prices reflect all available information quickly and accurately. As far as we know, the present study is the first to explore the consequence of clustering. To inspect the role of clustering trades in price efficiency, we utilize three distinct methods commonly used in earlier work. First, in the spirit of Comerton-Forde and Putnins (2015), we construct two traditional measures of informational efficiency, namely, absolute values of intraday return autocorrelations and absolute values of intraday variance ratios. Second, we employ Boehmer and Kelley, (2009) high-frequency pricing-error measure, an indicator to quantify the temporary element which creates a wedge between traded prices and fundamental values. Third, following Hou and Moskowitz (2005), we estimate the lower-frequency Delay measure to evaluate how soon information is incorporated into stock prices. Due to the complementarity in their postulations, such research design enables us to ascertain how clustering affects price efficiency from various angles. Therefore, empirical analyses based on three dimensions of efficiency allow us to draw a reliable and holistic inference about the impact of clustering on asset pricing.====Moreover, our study is also motivated by the scarcity of literature examining trade-size clustering in the global market. In general, most previous studies focus on such irregular trading behavior in a single country. In tandem with the stealth trading, Frino et al., (2010) show that medium‐sized trades by the same broker convey greater information in Australia; Informed traders are documented to use the small-unrounded market orders in Germany (Dionne and Zhou, 2018); Mishra et al., (2015) reveal that cumulative price changes are primarily triggered by small trade sizes in India; Split orders with small or medium sizes are linked with a larger proportion of cumulative price changes in Korea (Chae and Lee, 2011); Będowska-Sójka (2014) discover that medium-sized trades deliver large price impacts in Poland; Foreign institutional traders tend to split their orders which are more informative in Taiwan (Chou and Wang, 2009); And Verousis and Ap Gwilym (2013) find that trades in clustered sizes carry more information than non-clustered trades in U.K. To fill the void in prior researches, our paper is going to conduct a comprehensive examination of trade-size clustering around the world.====By taking advantage of intraday data in 26 countries, we find that price efficiency is enhanced by clustering trades with similar sizes. Specifically, intraday prices with greater trade-size clustering tend to approximate to fundamentals, because they are more akin to a random walk than counterparts with less clustering. Furthermore, the effect of clustering trades is quite significant to curtail pricing errors, which drives the short-term informational efficiency. Lastly, more clustering trades are linked with less price delays, pointing to the notion that clustering trades accelerate the integration of information into markets. Overall, our results comply with the stealth trading hypothesis that informed traders apply the clustering strategy to cover up private information, ultimately leading to informational efficiency.====To explicate the positive impact of clustering, we further examine three potential mechanisms as to how clustering trades improve price efficiency. Given the stealth trading hypothesis works, we firstly verify whether clustering trades carry price-relevant information. This information-based mechanism is crucial because we presume that clustering trades are leveraged by informed investors to deliver private information to the market. As Glosten and Milgrom (1985) and Kyle (1985) argue that information-driven order flow engenders price adjustments, informed trades camouflaged by clustering tactics would be finally translated into prices, a manifestation of efficiency enhancement. Our evidence lends support to this view that clustering trades are informative.====Additionally, Admati and Pfleiderer (1988) proclaim that the timing of stealth trading always falls on the period when the market is flooded by uninformed traders. By virtual of placing trades in times of extremely heavy transactions, stealth investors can better disguise their trades over the short term. However, as the stealth trading goes on, uninformed investors would gradually detect such private information and follow suit. Their coordinated action eventually push information to be factored into prices. This reasoning is in line with Bali et al., (2014) who highlight the positive role of attention and liquidity in price efficiency. Because more uninformed traders denote higher attention and greater liquidity, both are beneficial for price responses to private information contained in clustering trades. If this logic is valid to some degree, a positive relationship is anticipated between clustering trades and investor attention (stock liquidity), which is dubbed the attention-base (liquidity-based) mechanism in this paper. Our evidence is favorable to both channels, indicating that attention and liquidity are another candidates to connect clustering with efficiency.====This article makes two contributions to the extant literature. First, we complement earlier work on trade-size clustering (Alexander and Peterson, 2007; Blau et al., 2012; Meng et al., 2013) by looking into its consequence rather than the cause. Prior studies either examine the presence of clustering in various markets or explain such behavior with cognitive processing costs, negotiations costs, and information-revelation costs. However, this article sheds light on the impact of clustering and assesses whether it is beneficial or detrimental to price efficiency. Second, unlike clustering on rounded sizes in previous literature, we construct the Herfindahl index (Neumark and Sharpe, 1992) to capture trade-size clustering on both rounded and non-rounded numbers.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 elaborates the data, variable measurement, and research design. Section 3 reports the empirical results regarding the impact of clustering on price efficiency. Section 4 investigates three feasible mechanisms through which clustering trades improve price efficiency.

We conducted a daily web survey for seven days before and after the election, obtaining 1068 responses. Estimating a fixed effects model, we found that among those whose expectation differed from the reality, supporters of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the winner, became significantly happier, and supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) and New Komeito, the losers, became significantly unhappier on the day following the election. However, happiness returned to the previous level in one or two days, implying people adapted to the news very quickly. On the other hand, the happiness level of those whose expectation of the election results were realized did not change. In a word, only unexpected results matter. Dividing those who support the policies of DPJ into two groups, those who expect material benefits from the victory of DPJ and those who do not, the obtained results suggested that the reason why the supporters of the winner (DPJ) felt happy was not because they obtained material benefits from the change of government.","The goal of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms by which election results affect happiness. This topic has not been examined up until now.====Though the economics of happiness has a long tradition stretching back to Van Praag’s Leiden school, it was only after 2000 that many economists began to be attracted by this topic. Since then, research has extended into various fields including the study of political processes.==== Among these studies, Frey and Stutzer have elucidated how democracy is important to happiness, analyzing the political institutions in Switzerland (Frey and Stutzer, 2002a; Frey, 2008). Recently, Bok has opened up the study of the politics of happiness (Bok, 2010). This paper can be regarded as part of the field of “politics and happiness,” since it analyzes the relationship between elections and happiness.====We investigate whether news of election results affects the happiness of voters. Kimball et al. (2006) examined the effects of hurricane Katrina on the happiness of U.S. residents, and Uchida et al. (2013) and Ishino et al. (2013) investigated the effect of the Great East Japan Earthquake on the happiness of Japanese people. Since elections are macro events, the present study can be regarded as an investigation of the effect of macro news on happiness.====In the past there have been few studies that investigate whether elections affect happiness.==== The few exceptions we know of are Gilbert et al. (1998), Wilson et al. (2003), Tsutsui et al. (2010), Kimball et al. (2014), and Pierce et al. (2014). This study tries to add to this sparse literature. In addition, we analyze two problems that the previous studies did not address. The first of these is hedonic adaptation. People have a baseline level of happiness from which their happiness temporarily jumps up (down) when good (bad) news arrives, but their happiness returns to the individual baseline rather quickly (Kimball and Willis, 2006). Personal news has about five times the influence of macro news, and the influence and the impact of personal news is more persistent; in contrast, the impact of macro news lasts only about two days (Kimball et al., 2007). Therefore, although election results might affect voters’ happiness just after the election, we would expect happiness to revert to its previous level immediately. Of course, the extent of the influence, the size, and the time that the effects last all depend on the nature of the macro news. For example, Hurricane Katrina lowered Americans’ happiness for three weeks (Kimball et al., 2006).　====Wilson et al. (2003) investigated the impact of the U.S. presidential election in 2000. They asked 52 college students, who reported themselves to be deeply interested in politics, about their happiness one day after Gore conceded the election. Bush supporters were significantly happier than Gore supporters.====On the other hand, Gilbert et al. (1998) analyzed happiness among 57 voters in a 1994 gubernatorial election in Texas one month after the election, and found no evidence that winners became happier than losers.====Using a monthly survey, Tsutsui et al. (2010) examined whether the landslide victory of the Koizumi Cabinet in the general election on September 11, 2005 made Japanese people happy and/or unhappy. The authors found no significant changes in the happiness of supporters and non-supporters of the ruling parties between August and September. However, they found that the happiness of supporters of winners (losers) tends to rise (fall), although the results are statistically insignificant; this suggests that Japanese people’s happiness was only slightly affected by the election results.====Kimball et al. (2014) looked at the dynamic response of happiness to outcomes of the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Presidential elections. They developed a model to show how individual’s emotions reacted to electoral outcomes, based on the model of Kimball and Willis (2006). They found that the strength of political preferences, as well as prior expectations about the election outcome, determined the size of the change in happiness from before to after the election. They also found that individuals hedonically adapt very quickly.====Using the CivicScience data, Pierce et al. (2014) analyzed the 2012 U.S. Presidential election and found that the election results strongly affected the immediate happiness/sadness of partisan losers (Republican), but minimally impacted partisan winners (Democrats).====These studies suggest that adaptation is a critical factor, and that election results generally affect happiness only for a short time following the election. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a daily survey that covers the period before and after a voting day. This enables us to elucidate not only whether election results affect happiness just after the election, but also how this effect disappears over time. Specifically, we conducted a daily survey about the election for the House of Representatives conducted on August 30, 2009, obtaining 1068 responses from people of various generations. This election was a historic event in that the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) and New Komeito, then in power, lost in a landslide, and the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) took power.==== This was a very rare event in Japan. We test the hypothesis that the supporters for LDP and New Komeito became unhappier and that supporters for DPJ became happier following the election. In testing this hypothesis, we measure the speed of hedonic adaptation for both.====We further hypothesize that the effect of an election’s outcome on happiness is directly correlated to whether one expected the election outcome. Thus, if the election results matched one’s expectations prior to the election, the outcome would not have a significant effect on happiness. To test this hypothesis, we asked respondents whether the election results were in line with their expectations of the outcome and investigated whether the reactions of those for whom the election outcome was unexpected were stronger than those for whom it was not. 　====We also investigate why election results affect happiness. Traditional economics holds that peoples’ utility is determined by the material benefits they enjoy. To examine whether this materialism applies to happiness as well, we compare the happiness of two groups – one who expected to receive material benefit from a DPJ victory, and another who did not. Traditional economics would predict that the former group experienced a more positive change in happiness than the latter group.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the election and our survey are explained and a preliminary analysis is done. In Section 3, we explain our analytical framework. Section 4 reports our main results. In Section 5, we investigate the reason why the election results made people happy and unhappy.

Using Japanese microdata consisting of individuals aged 26–51, we find that (i) while men’s probability of working does not respond to inheritance receipt, women’s probability of working decreases; and (ii) in the case of most respondents the receipt of an inheritance seems to be unanticipated. We also test the unitary household model using information on respondents’ spouses. The results indicate that who received an inheritance influences the labor supply decision of each household member, meaning that we find no support for the unitary model.","Understanding the effects of wealth on individual labor supply can provide meaningful insights for both researchers and policymakers. In an academic context, while many macroeconomic models assume that leisure is a normal good, some studies, especially those analyzing the effects of news shocks on macroeconomic variables (see, e.g., Beaudry and Portier, 2014), rely on the formulation of household preferences proposed by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988) in which the effect of wealth on individual labor supply is zero.==== To make simulation exercises using macroeconomic models more reliable, it is important to empirically examine to what extent changes in wealth influence individual labor supply. In addition, if wealth has an impact on individual labor supply, this might also provide important insights on the link between wealth and consumption. Several recent studies examining the effect of wealth on household consumption find a much smaller marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of wealth than predicted by the standard life-cycle/permanent income hypothesis (LC/PIH).==== As highlighted by Cheng and French (2000), this may be due to a strong positive effect of wealth on leisure. That is, people consume an increase in wealth eventually, but mostly in the form of increased leisure, not consumption.====From policymakers’ point of view, it is also important to understand to what extent an exogenous change in wealth reduces people’s incentive to work. For example, one important policy issue has been whether an expansion of welfare programs to mitigate inequality depresses recipients’ work incentives. While a substantial amount of empirical evidence on the effects of welfare programs on individual labor supply has been accumulated for the United States (see Moffitt, 2002 for a comprehensive survey), evidence for Japan is still limited.====Against this background, the current paper examines the effects of wealth on individual labor supply using panel microdata for Japan. To identify the wealth effects on individual labor supply, the simplest approach is to regress individuals’ employment status or hours worked on non-labor income using cross-section data. As highlighted by Keane (2011), however, one of the drawbacks of this approach is the endogeneity problem arising from the possible correlation between non-labor income and unobserved preferences for work. For instance, those who prefer working to enjoying leisure likely accumulate more wealth, which in turn means that they likely will receive more non-labor income (asset returns). In this case, the resulting positive correlation between the error term and non-labor income creates an upward bias in the estimation of wealth effects. For example, regressing men’s hours worked on various types of non-labor income and a number of demographic variables using cross-sectional data for the United States, Pencavel (1986) suggests that an additional 10,000 dollars in asset income are associated with an ==== in annual hours worked of 46 h. However, this result seems rather counterintuitive and a possible explanation is the failure to control for unobserved preferences.====One way to overcome the endogeneity problem arising from ignoring preferences is to adopt a fixed effects approach using panel data. However, there may be other omitted variables potentially giving rise to endogeneity. To deal with such endogeneity issues, researchers often exploit situations or events that can be regarded as akin to randomized controlled experiments. In the case of research on the effect of wealth on individual labor supply, most studies following this approach focus on one of the following three types of natural experiment.====The first type of natural experiment employed is to focus on the effects of winning the lottery (Picchio, Suetens, and van Ours, 2017; Cesarini et al., 2017; Arvey et al., 2004; Imbens et al., 2001; Lindh and Ohlsson, 1996). Since winning the lottery is a random event (once the number of lottery tickets purchased is controlled for), it provides researchers with an ideal opportunity to identify the effect of an exogenous increase in wealth on individual labor supply.====The second type of experiment focuses on exogenous changes in taxes and the social security system such as changes in social benefits for recipients around a certain age (Bargain and Doorley, 2011; Lemieux and Milligan, 2008), changes in social security benefits after retirement (Coile and Gruber, 2007; Chan and Stevens, 2004; Krueger and Pischke, 1992), changes in the normal retirement age (Hanel and Riphahn, 2012; Mastrobuoni, 2009), and changes in the tax system (Blundell et al., 1998; Eissa and Liebman, 1996). Since changes in taxes and the social security system are independent of individuals’ decision making, they also enable us to identify the effect of exogenous changes in wealth on individual labor supply.====The third type of experiment uses the incidence of inheritance receipt (Sugano and Matsuyama, 2017; Doorley and Pestel, 2016; Elinder et al., 2012; Brown et al., 2010; Joulfaian and Wilhelm, 1994; Holtz-Eakin et al., 1993). Compared to the previous two experiments, the disadvantage of this approach is that the probability of inheritance receipt and the inheritance amount may not be completely exogenous to individuals. For example, decedents may give a larger share to lazy children when dividing up their inheritance. Since lazy people are more likely to be out of the labor force, ignoring the preference for work gives rise to a downward bias in estimates of the link between wealth and individual labor supply.==== This kind of bias, however, can be overcome by using panel data, provided that individual preferences are constant over time.====In the present paper, we follow the third approach and exploit inheritance receipt as an exogenous change in household wealth. The relative advantage of using this approach compared to focusing on changes in taxes and the social security system is that the latter often apply only to a specific group of the population. Lemieux and Milligan (2008), for example, focus on the fact that in Quebec, before 1989, childless social assistance recipients aged under 30 received much lower benefits than recipients aged 30 or above. Using a regression discontinuity approach, they find that the more generous social assistance benefits for those aged 30 and over reduced labor force participation. However, we think that the labor supply responses of those aged around 30 may substantially differ from other age groups, so that it would be problematic to generalize from such results. In contrast, the incidence of inheritance receipt does not apply to a specific group of the population only and inheritance recipients in our dataset range from age 26 to 51 at the time they received their inheritance.====Another advantage of our dataset is that it provides information on the employment status of the respondent’s spouse and whether the respondent’s spouse received an inheritance. This information enables us to test the unitary model, in which a household is regarded as a single decision-making unit.====The important theoretical prediction of the unitary model is that a household pools its resources, so that household resources (not individual resources) are important for each individual’s decision-making. In our dataset, we can test the unitary model by examining whether who received an inheritance within a household affects each household member’s labor supply. That is, if the size of wealth effects on individuals’ labor supply does depend on who received an inheritance within a household, the unitary model of the household is rejected.====The current paper is not the first attempt to examine the effect of wealth on individual labor supply employing a dataset on inheritances in Japan. Using the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR), which is a biennial panel dataset covering individuals aged 50–75, Sugano and Matsuyama (2017) show that receiving an inheritance of 1 million yen increases the probability of retirement by 1 percentage point at age 60 and 6 percentage points at age 65 and that an unanticipated inheritance has a larger negative effect on individual labor supply. Our analysis differs from Sugano and Matsuyama’s (2017) study in the following respects. First, their focus is the labor supply decision of elderly individuals aged 50–75, whereas we focus on working-age individuals from 26 to 51 years of age. Therefore, the results of our analysis can be regarded as complementary to theirs. Second, while JSTAR provides information on the inheritance amount only at the household level, our dataset, which we describe in detail in Section 2, contains the inheritance amount ====. This allows us to test the unitary model as described above.====The remainder of the study is organized as follows. The next section introduces the dataset we employ and a first-shot result from our dataset. Section 3 describes our empirical strategy and estimation results.

This paper examines whether it has indeed contributed to economic growth in its partner countries, as an attempt to respond to the question of how ODA can promote growth. It employs an ==== using a panel dataset of 117 countries from 1980 to 2010 and disaggregated ODA flows from five major donors and the sum of all the other donors. Our study finds that Japanese ODA is positively associated with industrial growth in its partner countries, through which it has contributed to their economic growth.","For the past several decades, researchers have been debating the question of whether official development assistance (ODA) has significantly promoted economic growth. The origin of the debate dates back to as early as the 1970s (Hansen and Tarp, 2000; Roodman, 2007), with one of the pioneers being Griffin and Enos (1970), who concluded that foreign aid may even hinder economic growth. With more data being available, Burnside and Dollar (2000) conducted one of the most noted studies in recent years on this topic and concluded that ODA contributes to growth if the country is in a good policy environment. It triggered a series of similar research projects, with both supportive and non-supportive conclusions. Unfortunately, the debate on whether foreign aid has promoted economic growth remains unsolved.====The existing studies attempt to examine the association between ODA and economic growth by using different instrumental variables, such as ==== by Burnside and Dollar (2000). Indeed, it is crucial to explore what kinds of factors connect ODA and growth. On the other hand, these studies neglect to pay attention to “ODA’s heterogeneity” (Sawada, 2014). They merely examine the total amount of foreign aid to each recipient country, not taking into account the types or origins of the foreign aid. In other words, their debate centers on whether foreign aid as a whole has intrinsically promoted economic growth, regardless of what the purposes of foreign aid are or how it is utilized. Even if a study finds no clear relationship between the total amount of foreign aid and economic growth, it would be imprudent to conclude that all types of ODA are equally ineffective. Besides, such an argument does not contribute to the discussion on how developing countries should better utilize ODA. An interesting exception was Akramov (2012), who compared different types of foreign aid in terms of its objectives, and concluded that aid for production sectors and infrastructure has positive effects on economic growth. Such a viewpoint is important as it could provide useful policy implications on the role of ODA.====Considering the heterogeneity of ODA, we pay attention to the different strategies and approaches for the provision of ODA that each donor has. More specifically, this study focuses on the uniqueness of Japanese ODA in comparison with Western donors’ ODA. Sawada (2014, p.66) describes these characteristics as the “Japanese ODA Model,” whereas Kato et al. (2016, p.352) more broadly call it as the “East Asian Model of development assistance,” taking into account the similarities in ODA among Japan, South Korea, and China (Stallings and Kim, 2016). These characteristics include a great emphasis on the partner countries’ ownership or “self-help”, a geographical focus on Asia, a large proportion of concessional loans, and a preference for economic infrastructure in order to promote industrial development (Feasel, 2015; Kato et al., 2016; Kurosaki and Otsuka, 2015; Manning, 2016; Ohno and Ohno, 2013; Ranis et al., 2011). They are deemed to have their roots in Japan’s own pre-war experience of government-led industrialization through infrastructure investment and its post-war catch-up through large investments in infrastructure (Addison and Tarp, 2016; Feasel, 2015; Kurosaki and Otsuka, 2015; Ranis et al., 2011).====Feasel (2015) compares Japanese ODA with that of the United States and other members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and concludes that Japanese ODA has the strongest impact on the real GDP growth of the 99 sample developing countries. He conjectures that it is probably because “Japanese ODA is more focused on infrastructure development” (Feasel, 2015, p.183).====Indeed, it is difficult to identify the causal effect of ODA on the GDP growth of recipient countries since there are a large number of confounding factors which affect the GDP growth and ODA inflows. However, based on the assumption that industrial growth is a key component of economic growth, it would be relevant to argue that ODA contributes to economic growth if ODA contributes to industrial growth. In fact, industrialization has been often referred to as the “engine of growth” (Cornwall, 1977, p.122; Szirmai, 2011, p.406). Szirmai (2011) argues that industry has greater advantages in its higher productivity growth than other sectors due importantly to economies of scale. Sonobe and Otsuka (2006) argue that labor-intensive industrialization provides job opportunities for unskilled labor, thereby contributing to equitable economic growth and poverty eradication. Page and Shimeles (2015) give support to this argument by emphasizing the importance of industrialization in creating enough jobs for poverty eradication in Africa. On another front, Rodrik (2013, p.165) observes “unconditional convergence in labor productivity” in manufacturing industries, whereas he finds no clear convergence in the agriculture or service sectors. This suggests that developing countries may be able to catch up in terms of productivity primarily in manufacturing industries and, hence, the expansion of their share in a developing country is a critically important condition for overall economic growth. Page (2011) also argues that the low growth rate of African countries was due to their failure to industrialize.====Therefore, this study will elaborate Feasel’s argument that Japanese ODA contributes to real GDP growth by promoting the industrial growth of recipient countries. It will attempt to show statistical evidence for the contribution of Japanese ODA to industrial growth in its partner countries by estimating its association with the growth of industrial GDP per capita in 117 developing countries from 1980 to 2010.====This study conducts a literature review to summarize the arguments for and against ODA and introduces the unique characteristics of Japanese ODA in Section 2. It is followed by the regression analysis on the relationship between ODA and industrial GDP in Section 3. Then, we will conclude this study by discussing its policy implications.",Has ODA contributed to growth?

Moreover, local market-oriented firms do need more patents to protect their products, whereas scientific firms demonstrate a lower willingness to register patents in China.","Why do the affiliates of multinational enterprises (MNEs) undertake research and development (R&D) and then apply for patents in a host country? Both issues have received growing attention with separate and limited studies. In the current work, we study these issues and focus on Japanese affiliates in China—a country with a large domestic market but weak intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection. Data of Japanese firms is a typical sample in the literature to examine these issues. On the one hand, Japan is one of the largest FDI sourcing countries in China. For example, among the top-ranked source countries/regions of FDI into China, Japan ranked as the top 2 in 2005 with an amount of US$6.530 billion, following Hong Kong.==== On the other hand, Japanese FDI concentrates more on capital- and technology-intensive industries (Ito et al., 2016), rather than labor-intensive industries as those from Hong Kong. Therefore, Japanese affiliates might devote more efforts to adaptive R&D and apply for patents in China. Indeed, among foreign inventors, Japan ranked the top one in invention patents approved by China in the 2000s (discussed in next section). By linking affiliates – patent – Customs – parent data, the roles of trade types and the within-MNE characteristics are investigated. Our goal is to provide a holistic view of affiliates’ innovative activities from the decision of undertaking R&D to the patenting performance in the host country.====In an era of liberalization and globalization, large amounts of foreign direct investments (FDIs) have been recorded in the past two decades, particularly toward developing countries. Foreign affiliates are traditionally subordinate to MNEs in executing the parent firms’ operational strategies, such as export-platform FDI. However, along with the increased complexity of overseas production and operation, foreign affiliates now play an increasingly more active role in exercising strategic choices (Birkinshaw and Pedersen, 2009), that is, the affiliates can independently implement specific strategies to develop new products and processes based on local conditions. These affiliates must be able to develop and implement effective and responsive business strategies to meet the local business conditions, thus highlighting the emerging independent role played by MNE affiliates in their respective host countries, particularly large ones likes China. In other words, there are subsidiary-specific advantages in MNEs as noted by Rugman and Verbeke (2001). Conducting R&D and patenting activities in the host country are now considered crucial innovation strategies adopted by foreign affiliates among various business strategy options. However, issues regarding what factors affect their R&D activity and the consequent efficiency of patenting for foreign affiliates in host countries have yet to be systematically examined.====Reallocating R&D overseas (i.e., R&D internationalization) is an emerging innovation strategy adopted by many MNEs. Its driving force is mainly two-fold: one is the demand-driven force that gets close to local customers and develops products to adapt to local markets, and the other is the supply-driven force that accesses local research networks (highly skilled scientific personnel and renowned universities or research institutes) and places potential partners (customers and suppliers) in close proximity with one another.====Some developing countries have a large market and qualified R&D personnel who are inexpensive to hire, and both factors contribute to thriving offshore R&D being utilized by MNEs in developing economies, especially China and India (Bruche, 2009; Jin et al., 2014). For example, China’s R&D intensity (the share of R&D expenditure to GDP) increased from 0.83% to 2.07% between 1999 and 2015, suggesting an increasing emphasis on innovations in China. Through the establishment of overseas R&D laboratories and foreign affiliates to conduct R&D and manufacturing activities, MNEs can develop new products (or processes) at a lower cost to serve local and global markets. Several previous studies have investigated the determinants of reallocating R&D to China (Grimes and Miozzo, 2015; Liu and Chen, 2012; Yang and Hayakawa, 2015).====Doing R&D is one thing, but applying for patents in the host country is another. As the patent law applies the territoriality principle, it indicates that invented goods are protected only in the country in which the patent is granted. China’s institutional environment is widely criticized as lacking laws and rigorous systems to protect IPRs (Hu and Jefferson, 2009). Such weak IPR protection does not punish imitations, rendering patents worthless and the prevalence of imitations. Hu and Jefferson (2009) find that the efficiency of patenting varies between local firms and foreign-owned enterprises (FOEs) in China, implying the existence of specific characteristics that affect the patenting activities of FOEs.====Consequently, a crucial paradox emerges: despite the weak IPR protection in China, MNEs are increasingly reallocating their R&D activities to China and attempting to seek shelter from imitation and competition by applying for patents there. Yet, despite the advantage of its large market to induce FOEs to practice its superior technologies and sell innovative products in China, they may be deterred from patenting innovative outputs in the Chinese market. Our study attempts to explore these issues by examining FOEs’ R&D and patenting activities in China, using firm-level data of Japanese affiliates in China linked with Customs data, parent-firm characteristics, and patent information.====Clarifying the patenting activities of FOEs is a crucial and much debated issue in China. FOEs play a critical role in China’s economic development; access to the World Trade Organization, granted in 2001, facilitated China’s integration into the global economy, thereby attracting a substantial inflow of FDI, mainly with the purpose of undertaking assembly exports. FOEs also play a predominant role in China’s manufacturing sector in terms of both output and export; for example, FOEs contributed 31.61% of output and 58.2% of exports in 2006. Along with the consistent increases in GDP per capita in China, FOEs may place more emphasis on serving the domestic market and utilizing IPR protection as a method of protecting their products. This development highlights the growing importance of patenting for FOEs in China. However, after long-term success regarding the promotion of economic growth through the inflow of FDIs, China has changed its focus to attracting technology-intensive and R&D-intensive FDIs, with the aim of facilitating indigenous technological development. Understanding the patenting activities of FOEs can provide insights into IPRs and technological policies in China.====This paper examines the determinants of FOEs’ R&D and patenting activities in China through a panel dataset of Japanese affiliates during the period 2001–2007. In comparison to previous studies in this line of research, the current study has three novel elements. First, most of the international R&D studies focus on examining the determinants of allocating R&D activity overseas by the parent firms of MNEs, whereas this question is less examined from the viewpoint of affiliates, except for Yang and Hayakawa (2015). This problem suggests the need of more empirical evidence. Second, although the dramatic upsurge in patenting in China has recently received considerable attention, patenting by FOEs has not yet been investigated; thus, this paper evaluates the efficiency of patenting of FOEs in China. Third, exploiting the advantage of detailed information by linking data from various sources, we examine two crucial factors, trade type and linkage with the parent firm, which affect subsidiaries’ R&D and patenting activities. Export and R&D has been witnessed to have a positive relation in extant studies (e.g., Baldwin and Gu, 2004; Lileeva and Trefler, 2010). However, Yang (2018) claims that heterogeneity in exports affect firms’ innovations in China. Although exports overall have a positive relationship with R&D and new product sales, the innovation effect of process exports is significantly negative. It implies that trade types may affect FOEs’ R&D and patenting activities in the local market. Given that FOEs generally undertake process export in China, the issue of how this export type relates to their innovation activities is worth investigating. Moreover, a foreign affiliate’s ability to create local innovations relies heavily on the capability development of the MNE–subsidiary linkages (Rugman and Verbeke, 2001) and on the MNEs’ consideration of the geographical distribution of affiliates in the host countries. Therefore, the innovative activities of FOEs are linked to parent-firm heterogeneity.====The remainder of the paper is organized into sections. Section 2 introduces the crucial role of Japanese firms in the granting of invention patents and briefly reviews firm-level patenting activity in China.

We use as case studies Japan's 2013 and 2016 Upper House elections, a main issue of which was the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Candidates’ promises about the TPP are unrelated to whether they run for one-seat, multi-seat, or proportional representation constituencies. Candidates who have more rival candidates belonging to the same party are less supportive of the TPP, whereas candidates who face fiercer competition with rival candidates of other parties are more supportive. This result, however, is not observed after the conclusion of the TPP negotiations. The presence of agriculture in local economies relates to candidates’ opposition of the TPP before the conclusion of negotiations, but not thereafter. Conversely, candidates’ stances on the TPP are affected by their parties’ policies and own ideologies regardless of the different stages of promoting the TPP. These results indicate that the major determinants of candidates’ positions toward an FTA vary according to the changes in circumstances surrounding the FTA.","While globalization is rapidly progressing, countries continue to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) to strengthen their economic relations with other countries.==== While FTAs affect national economic welfare positively, they have various effects on the income distribution and consequently lead to conflicts between opponents and supporters. They often become major political issues in democratic countries, and consequently politicians serve as opponents or supporters of FTAs to win elections and substantially affect their promotion. Many political economy studies have discussed a number of the factors that motivate politicians to oppose or support FTAs.====Kaempfer and Marks (1993) and Kahane (1996a) examine the determinants of U.S. Congressional voting on the fast-track bill crucial for agreeing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Conconi et al. (2012) also examine the voting behaviors of U.S. senators and congresspeople on fast-track authorities since 1974. Steagall and Jennings (1996), Kahane (1996b), Thorbecke (1997), Kang and Greene (1999), and Magee (2010) investigate the determinants of U.S. Congressional voting on NAFTA. Baldwin and Magee (2000), addressing the endogeneity of political contributions, also analyze the voting behavior of U.S. representatives on trade bills including NAFTA. These studies show that industry structure and workers’ skill level in constituencies as well as the magnitude of labor and business campaign contributions affect the voting behavior of representatives,==== supporting that industries and interest groups exert a substantial impact on politicians in the process of trade legislation through lobbying and campaign activities.====While these studies focus on the influence of industries and interest groups on politicians, recent studies pay more attention to the role of political institutions in trade politics. This is because political institutions shape whose interests politicians represent in their home districts to win elections. Grossman and Helpman (2005) theoretically prove that majoritarian systems result in more protectionist trade policies than proportional systems.==== The prediction about the protectionist bias of majoritarian systems is empirically supported by cross-national studies such as Evans (2009), Ardelean and Evans (2013), and Hatfield and Hauk (2014).==== Concerning FTAs, Kagitani and Harimaya (2017), analyzing the 2012 House of Representatives election in Japan, show that proportional representation candidates tend to favor the conclusion of the FTA than candidates for single-seat constituencies.====Further, several studies investigate how constituency size affects the behavior of politicians in trade politics, because large constituencies, which are more populous and more industrially diversified, allow candidates not to pursue special interests in each constituency. Karol (2007) finds that senators are more likely to vote for liberalized trade bills than House members; however, the driving reason is unrelated to constituency size. Ehrlich (2009) also shows that constituency size does not influence U.S. Congressional voting patterns on trade bills. Conconi et al. (2014) demonstrate that U.S. senators are more likely to favor free trade than congresspeople, and a reason behind this is not constituency size but rather election proximity. Ito (2015), focusing on candidates for single-seat constituencies in Japan's 2012 election for the House of Representatives, shows that the impact of constituency size on candidates’ attitudes toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) varies depending on the share of workers in comparatively disadvantaged sectors.====Based on the foregoing, we investigate how the difference in electoral rules and changing circumstances surrounding an FTA affect candidates’ stances on the FTA. To this end, this study uses as case studies the electoral competition in Japan's House of Councilors elections in 2013 and 2016. These elections, a major issue of which was the TPP, provide valuable case examples for the following two reasons. First, we can exploit the institutional feature of the election system for the House of Councilors, where the number of members is 242 and half of them, whose term is six years, are elected every three years: 73 seats are elected from single- or multi-seat prefectural constituencies under the plurality system and 48 seats from the nationwide proportional representation constituency under the open-list system. Since members of the House of Councilors are elected in three ways, these cases allow us to compare the impacts of single-seat, multi-seat, and proportional representation constituencies. Second, whether to join the TPP is arguably one of the hottest political debates about Japan's postwar trade policy. The TPP issue has caused public concern, particularly about the sustainability of agriculture and farming villages, safety and security of food, and maintenance of the universal healthcare system. Diet members and political parties split into two factions, one supporting the TPP and the other opposing it. As a result, the TPP issue had been controversial for a number of years. The 2013 Upper House election was held soon after the decision on Japan's participation in the TPP talks and the 2016 election was held shortly after the TPP was signed by member nations. These cases therefore allow us to shed light on the kinds of factors affecting candidates’ stances on an FTA before and after the conclusion of negotiations on the FTA.====This study concentrates on what determines candidates’ election promises about an FTA without worrying about controlling for country-specific factors such as the systems of politics, administration, and justice, and thereby contributes to the body of knowledge in three main ways. First, this study can examine how differences in electoral rules affect candidates in a national election. Although many previous studies do not distinguish proportional representation election systems by their ballot types such as open-list and closed-list systems, this study directly compares the impact of the open-list proportional representation system with that of the single-seat constituency system.==== Second, this study helps our understanding of how the changes in circumstances surrounding an FTA affect candidates’ stances on the FTA. With the progress of FTA negotiations, for example, the government can adopt domestic measures to promote the negotiations or bargain for a better agreement to minimize a public backlash. Through these situational changes, voters will change their opinions about the FTA and thus politicians or candidates will alter their position on the FTA. This point has received little attention in previous studies. Third, while previous cross-national studies examine the country-level determinants of protectionism, this study investigates the individual candidate-level determinants of protectionism. Although many studies examine the behavior of election winners, this study sheds light on the campaign activities of various candidates including incumbents, former Diet members, and fresh candidates.==== This enhances our understanding of “====”==== for trade policies.====This study empirically examines the determinants of candidates’ campaign policies about the TPP in the House of Councilors elections in 2013 and 2016 by using the UTokyo-Asahi Candidate Surveys of 2013 and 2016.==== Firstly, we show that there is no difference in attitudes toward the TPP among candidates running for one-seat, multi-seat, or proportional representation constituencies in the 2013 and 2016 House of Councilors elections. In the 2013 Upper House election, however, candidates’ electoral promises about the TPP are related to how fierce candidates compete with rivals from both inside and outside their own parties, although this relationship is not observed in the 2016 Upper House election. When candidates face more competitive election races with rival candidates of other parties, they are more likely to support the TPP. Conversely, when candidates face more competitive election races with rival candidates belonging to the same party, they are more likely to oppose the TPP. Secondly, candidates are more likely to oppose the TPP in the 2013 Upper House election when there are many agriculture, forestry, and fisheries workers in their districts, whereas they do not have the same tendency in the 2016 Upper House election. Lastly, candidates’ attitudes toward the TPP relate to their parties’ clear-cut policies and their ideologies in both Upper House elections. Candidates favoring a small government and those emphasizing the Japan–United States relation are more likely to support the TPP even after controlling for the contents of their parties’ campaign promises about the TPP. These results indicate that the major determinants of candidates’ preferences for an FTA vary along with changes in the circumstances surrounding the FTA.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 begins by explaining the background of the TPP and 2013 Upper House election and investigates what affects candidates’ stances on the TPP in the 2013 election. Section 3 describes the background of the TPP and 2016 Upper House election and examines the determinants of candidates’ policies on the TPP in that election.

Log earnings differentials between two cohorts of the same age calculated from 2012 and 2017 surveys reveal a substantial earnings decline for university graduates around age 43 and senior high school graduates around age 38 in 2017. These cohorts experienced a severe deterioration of job opportunities after the bubble burst. The Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition shows that the composition effect dominates the wage structure effect. In particular, a shortened length of tenure and a decline in the share of those working in a large firm are the main causes of the earnings gap for senior high school graduates and for university graduates, respectively. While an increase in the proportion of those working in the service sector and a reduced share of regular workers are also important determinants for the earnings differentials for high school graduates, deteriorated opportunities for ==== to supervisory positions play an important role for university graduates. Extending this analysis to a longer time period and estimating the cohort earnings differential equation clarify that the observed stability of cohort earnings differentials for university graduates emerge not only from the importance of firm size differentials in determining their earning differentials, but also from the high stability of firm size differentials between cohorts for university graduates.","The Japanese labour market is deemed to be on the verge of change. There are many symptoms: rising proportion of non-regular workers, a substantial increase in the share of women and older workers in the labour market, increased tendency for women to take a parental leave due to the introduction of work-life balance policy, are only a few examples. Less obvious is the changing nature of the wage structure. There are at least two changes that have attracted attention. First, wages have become more dispersed for those with similar characteristics. Rebick (2005) finds this tendency to be conspicuous for university-educated middle-aged men working in large or middle-sized firms. One reason for this may be an increased prevalence of the merit pay system in large Japanese firms. Another is the declining slope of the wage-tenure profile in Japan. A recent study finds that this occurs in conjunction with reduced worker-firm attachment (Kitagawa et al., 2018).====One important consequence of changes in the structure of wages is that it brings about the differences in wages between those who experienced such changes and those who did not. Specifically, these changes may affect wage differentials between cohorts (people born in the same year). Another factor that potentially influences the cohort wage differential is a change in the composition of workers. For example, an increased share of non-regular workers among young workers may change the cohort wage differentials even when the structure of wages does not change at all.====Examining wage differentials between cohorts is indispensable when understanding the Japanese labour market because the Japanese economy suffered a long-run stagnation called the lost decade(s) and a large number of job seekers found it difficult to obtain a regular job. It is widely accepted that this brought about the generation of the ‘employment ice age’ that had to face a more severe labour market condition compared to those who graduated school at a good time. If it is found that the ice age generation is suffering severe wage losses even today (25 years after the bubble burst), its mechanism should be investigated in order to design a better functioning labour market.====Despite of its importance, the analysis on wage differentials between cohorts is in its infancy. The aim of this paper is to analyse the recent changes in earnings between cohorts in depth. In order to achieve this goal, I use a large micro data set of individuals called the Basic Survey on Wage Structure collected annually by the Ministry of Labour, Health and Welfare. I first calculate the earnings differentials between two cohorts with 5-year gap evaluated at the same age using surveys conducted in 2012 and 2017. Having confirmed the existence of large cohort earnings differentials, the regressions are run for each age to estimate the log of real earnings with the explanatory variables such as tenure, type of employment, position in a firm, firm size, and industry. Then the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition was performed for each age so as to identify the source of cohort earnings differentials. The method decomposes the observed earnings differentials between the two cohorts into two parts: the composition effect that is due to the change in the composition of workers and the wage structure effect that is due to the changes in the structure of wages (changes in the coefficients of earnings regression). I further check whether the observed cohort earnings differentials between 2012 and 2017 had been stable over time.====The main results obtained in this paper are as follows. Log earnings differentials of men between two cohorts at the same age from 2012 and 2017 surveys reveal a substantial earnings decline for university graduates aged 43 (−0.14) and senior high school graduates aged 38 (−0.05) in 2017. These are the cohorts that experienced a severe deterioration of job opportunities after the bubble burst. The Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition shows that the composition effect dominates the wage structure effect. In particular, a shortened length of tenure and a decline in the share of those working in a large firm are the main causes of the earnings gap for senior high school graduates and for university graduates, respectively. While an increase in the proportion of those working in the service sectors and a reduced share of regular workers are also important determinants for the earnings differentials for high school graduates, deteriorated promotion opportunities to the supervisory position play an important role for university graduates. I extend this analysis to a longer time period to estimate a cohort earnings differentials equation. Notably, about a half of the observed log earnings differentials for university graduates can be accounted for by the changes in firm size and promotion opportunities between the cohorts. The results show that the observed stability of cohort earnings differentials for university graduates emerge not only from the importance of firm size differentials in determining earnings differentials, but also from the high stability of firm size differentials between cohorts for university graduates.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the relevant studies. Section 3 first explains the data and then examines the earnings differentials between the cohorts. Section 4 is devoted to the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition. Section 5 examines the stability of the earnings differentials using the surveys from 1989.

This is particularly the case when the implementation of deregulatory policies in developed countries is increasing the number of non-regular workers. One of the main goals of recent labour economics studies is to evaluate these deregulatory policies in labour markets. Contract duration, which the government can influence, is naturally regarded as one of the most important institutional features of labour markets.====In fact, the labour standards acts in OECD countries unambiguously distinguish between permanent and fixed-term employment, and strictly require employers to provide a labour contract with a clearly defined duration. In addition, regulations sometimes require employers to include information on whether the contract can be renewed in the case of a fixed-term contract. However, despite these regulations, it has become clear that a substantial proportion of employees in developed countries ==== their contract duration (hereafter, we refer to these employees as DNK employees). In this paper, we focus on this situation in two developed countries, Japan and Spain. As shown in Table 1, Japanese data reveal that 8% of employees do not know the duration of their labour contracts. The Spanish Statistics Bureau reports that 2% of employees in Spain do not know their contract duration but, as discussed in more detail in this paper, the Spanish data indicate that the actual proportion of DNK employees in Spain is much higher, at 11%====.====These proportions of DNK employees (whether 2%, 8% or 11%) are not negligible proportions of employees in labour markets. The figures indicate that the enforcement of legal requirements regarding labour standards has not been not fully effective in reality. Moreover, the ineffectiveness of the legal regulations may indicate that employees and employers are intentionally using ambiguous contracts as a commitment device (e.g., see Kelsey and Spanjers, 2004). Therefore, in this paper, we contribute to the literature by investigating the empirical linkage between employees’ perceptions of their labour contract duration and working conditions, focusing on workers who do not know the duration of their contracts.====By comparing Japanese and Spanish data, we find that not knowing the contract term is negatively related to the employee’s human capital level. Thus, women, single people, younger workers and older workers are more likely not to know their labour contract duration. This also applies to less-educated workers compared with well-educated workers. In addition, we report that DNK employees value their job less than do other workers because they are more likely to be searching for other jobs. Furthermore, the Japanese data suggest that DNK employees suffer from a wage penalty effect (for non-regular employees) and have less access to company training. In Spain, we find different results for Spanish citizens compared with immigrant workers. In contrast to Spanish citizens, DNK status for immigrant workers is related to male and married persons, as well as to certain occupations (particularly the construction sector). Therefore, we can conclude that DNK status is statistically related to disadvantageous working conditions.====This research has various policy implications. For instance, in March 2017, the Japanese government approved a so-called Action Plan for the Realization of Work Style Reform, which indicates that the government is aware of fairness issues regarding working conditions and knowledge of labour contract laws. One of the aims of the action plan is to clarify working conditions for employees, including by (1) preparing rules that will be the basis for court judgments and (2) obligating employers to explain terms and conditions to non-regular workers. In addition, the plan aims to ‘prepare laws for dispatched workers that obligate client companies to give dispatching business operators the information on working conditions of workers at client companies’ (Ogino, 2017, p. 4). In this paper, although we do not show any causal relationship between DNK and working conditions, we consider that improving access to information on the legal requirements for labour contracts may assist in improving the welfare of employees who tend to be DNK employees.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present a brief review of the literature and labour regulations in Japan and Spain. Section 3 explains the data and methodology. Section 4 discusses the empirical results of the comparative analysis.

Without imposing any ","Currency manipulation aimed for persistent exchange rate misalignment is detrimental to fair and free international trading system. However, it is not an easy task to evaluate whether a country's currency is over- or under-valued because its value against foreign currencies is affected by many concurrent factors including not only FX (foreign exchange) market intervention but also macroeconomomic fundamentals. For example, partly reflecting this difficulty, the US Treasury jointly consider three conditions to identify artificial devaluation: (1) a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, (2) a material current account surplus, and (3) persistent one-sided intervention in the FX market.====In addition to this US version of three criteria for designating a currency manipulator, we propose a “plucking model” of exchange rates that focuses on the time-series property of exchange rate. Our research is motivated by Milton Friedman's “plucking model” of output. Friedman (1993) argues that economic contractions involve drops below the economy's full-potential “ceiling,” rather than symmetric cycles around a “natural rate of output.” Kim and Nelson (1999a) formally set up an econometric model that encompasses permanent shocks, symmetric fluctuations, and asymmetric plucks over the business cycles. Their model includes Markov switching moving between the normal state and recession. They successfully show that US real GDP has a time-varying trend that can be interpreted as “natural level output” and it plucks downward from the trend during recessions.====Given that most advanced and emerging economies currently adopt flexible or (at least) managed floating exchange system, one may ask if the degree of flexibility is notably higher on one side of the market. In case a central bank intervene to resist depreciation, its purposes can be to calm down the fear of a collapse of confidence in its currency, or to relieve the debt burden of a country's domestic firms that has foreign-denominated debts, or to quench the inflation pressure through exchange rate pass-through. On the other hand, a central bank or government agency may intervene to resist appreciation.==== Like a recent case of Swiss National Bank (SNB), whose currency has been regarded as safe haven currency, it can intervene to taper off the pressure of appreciation. It may also intervene to avoid appreciation for its exporting firms’ competitiveness. In this regard, applying the model of Kim and Nelson (1999a) to Korean won/US dollar exchange rate, Park (2011) finds indirect evidence of intervention during the global financial crisis (GFC), during which South Korea suffered from volatile foreign capital flows.====Extending Park (2011), we propose a state-space model with Markov switching as an auxiliary tool for detecting currency manipulation. Our model tests if fluctuations of a country's exchange rate are symmetric and if there exists a time-varying support level or resistance level of exchange rate. Instead of relying on inputs (e.g., data on FX market operation of the central bank), our estimation uses only information on the outcome (that is, the exchange rate) to assess whether there is a tendency for the exchange rate to deviate only toward one side of the estimated trend.==== Using weekly and monthly exchange rates against US dollar from January 2001 to March 2017 (from June 2009 to March 2017 for China), we find that exchange rates of China, South Korea, Switzerland, and Taiwan rarely fall below its trend, but are plucked upward from time to time by transitory shocks, suggesting aversion to appreciation shocks.====In the sub-sample period analysis using the nominal exchange rate of CHF/EUR, our model accurately captures the period of Switzerland's minimum exchange rate (September 2011–January 2015), describing it as the period of time-varying support level of exchange rates. It is exactly consistent with the Swiss National Bank's intention to counter the “massive overvaluation” of its franc.==== Surprisingly, without adding any information to the model, it captures the period of September 2011–January 2015 with the probability of one, attesting the efficacy of our approach. We also analyze the effect of Abenomics, which was announced on November 2012. We find that, while Japan's exchange rate tends to fluctuate rather symmetrically before Abenomics (January 2001–December 2012), it moves with a time-varying lower bound from 2013, suggesting aversion to appreciation.====An advantage of our approach is to circumvent the difficulties of statistically associating the changes in a country's exchange rate with its market intervention (e.g., changes in foreign reserve) using regression or VAR framework. For example, an argument that a net purchase of foreign assets makes the domestic currency less valuable is based on the assumption of ====. If a net purchase that is motivated by appreciation shocks is not sufficient to counter those shocks, we may observe appreciation, not depreciation. That is, an endogenous intervention may blur the statistical relationship between exchange rate and market intervention. More recently, there has been a tendency to employ intervention instruments that do not affect the stock of international reserves. In addition, various factors make it more difficult. There are different and mixed motivations for market intervention such as exchange rate smoothing and controlling inflation. There are different intervention methods such as forward transactions and derivatives. Speculators’ transactions also hinder identifying the empirical link. As Larsen and Sørensen (2007) well point out, models that more explicitly describe the intervention policy, the speculator behavior, and other things may depend crucially on the details of the specification, and the models may be difficult to handle in practice. In this regard, our model draws evidence from the time-series property of exchange rate fluctuations, without imposing any theoretical constraints. Another advantage is that our model is relatively easy to estimate and interpret. By looking at the sign and statistical significance of one key parameter, one can reckon if a country's exchange rate is plucked upward or downward over time. However, we do not argue that our approach is superior to other methodologies. We emphasize the relative strength of our alternative approach and thus call it an auxiliary tool for examining the issues related to currency manipulation. We also oppose politically motivated trade barriers that may harm the world economy given the increased importance of global supply chains.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the literature related to asymmetric fluctuation of exchange rates and FX intervention and discusses the relative advantage of our approach. Section 3 briefly explains the data sources and sample periods, explains a model of asymmetric exchange rate based on a state-space model with Markov switching, and interprets the empirical results. Section 4 discusses our findings along with some caveats related to our approach. It explains why our approach should be used as an ‘auxiliary’ tool.

First, we developed a dual-labor supply model by adding the training effect of working second jobs. The theory showed that workers with unconstrained hours hold second jobs when they develop skills via the experience of second jobs. To verify the hypotheses from the theoretical model, the causal relationship between holding a second job and the wage rate of a main job was estimated using the Keio Household Panel Survey. Difference generalized method of moments was adopted to remove time-invariant individual effects and endogenous bias. Moreover, the estimations showed heterogeneity of main jobs in terms of length of working hours, tasks, and job turnover. Full-time workers engaged in intelligent tasks and those who did not change their jobs secured training effects from second jobs but only when the comparison group was the workers allowed to hold second jobs by their employers. It was presumed that employers paid to restrict employees’ activities. On the contrary, part-time workers engaged in physical tasks were exhausted by second jobs, which decreased the wage rate of their main jobs.","This study investigates the training effect of experience in multiple job holding (MJH). In traditional analysis of MJH, the focus is on workers whose working hours are constrained by holding second jobs for livelihood income. Recent studies have explored various motivations for holding second jobs, including directly earning utility (Casacuberta and Gandelman, 2012; Kawakami, 2017), avoiding being unemployed (Böheim and Taylor, 2004), and developing skills (Panos et al., 2014; Pouliakas, 2017). Skills development is the target of this study.====In Japan, the rate of MJH among employees is about 3.7%. This rate is not high relative to other developed countries (Fig. 1(a)). The Japanese government regards the low rate of MJH as the barrier to developing the economy. To solve labor shortages owing to aging population and low productivity, The Japanese government has implemented a policy to promote MJH among Japanese employees, the Action Plan for Work Style Reform, which states as follows.====Side jobs and multiple jobs done in conjunction are effective means for the development of new technologies, open innovation, and entrepreneurship.====The government of Japan considers that MJH has a role to play in promoting innovation. Specifically, MJH stimulates workers’ productivity via experience gained outside of main firms. Fig. 1(b) shows the relationship between MJH and GDP per capita, which is a surrogate index for workers’ productivity. An upward curve indicates correlation. While countries with higher rates of MJH earn higher GDP per capita, GDP per capita of countries with lower rates of MJH is scattered. Luxembourg and Ireland have high GDP per capita and low MJH rates. This is a proof that MJH is not a necessary and sufficient condition for promoting GDP per capita but is consistent with the fact that high MJH rate countries have highly efficient production.====Japanese law does not prohibit MJH for employees. However, several precedents showed the recognition of the right to dismiss for reason of MJH. Below cases of MJH are not protected. (1) holding second job of midnight work (the Ogawa Kensetsu case, Tokyo District Court (Nov. 19, 1982)). (2) Conflicts of interest caused from being the position of board of director of competitors (The Hashimoto Unyu case, Nagoya District Court in 1972). Even though Japanese low does not regulate MJH, MJH rate in Japan is lower than other developed countries (Fig. 1(a)). The reason that Japanese workers do not have the propensity to hold second jobs is that they are prohibited from doing so by the firms that employ them. Fig. 2 presents a summary of correspondence from a questionnaire about employees’ MJH in Japanese firms. The employers of 77.2% of the respondents prohibit MJH and most consider that MJH has a negative impact on their performance. On the other hand, firms that allow MJH do not have positive reasons for doing so (“no reason” is the most frequent answer) and the rate of “upskilling” reason is only 5.0%. Remarkably, most Japanese firms do not evaluate their employees’ MJH.====Japanese firms’ evaluation of MJH is acceptable because only a few studies analyze the efficacy of MJH for skills development (Wilson, 2009; Panos et al., 2014). Even though the Japanese government has been trying to accelerate MJH, there is insufficient quantitative evidence on the topic====. To fill this gap, this study aims to verify whether there is a positive or negative influence of MJH on workers’ skills development.====We adopt both theoretical and empirical approaches. The theory of the dual-labor supply model shows that full-time workers do not choose to hold second jobs but instead choose to work overtime when the wage rate of overtime work is higher than that of second jobs and MJH does not provide upskilling. If there is a training effect of MJH, workers might choose to hold second jobs despite low wage rates of second jobs.====In empirical analysis with Japanese panel data, we estimate the effect of MJH on the wage rate of main jobs by removing both fixed effects and endogenous bias with difference generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. The estimation results show that task heterogeneity in main jobs and length of working hours are key factors in considering the effects of MJH. MJH provides experience to stimulate skills development in intelligent tasks for full-time workers who do not change their jobs. The same propensity is observed in volunteer workers although the effect is small. Otherwise, this effect is observed only when the control group comprises single job holding (SJH) workers who are allowed to hold second jobs. SJH workers who are prohibited from holding second jobs earn higher wages than do MJH workers. This finding suggests Japanese firms pay compensation to restrict job choice during leisure hours.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we review previous research on MJH. Section 3 shows a simple dual-labor supply model to show the training effect of MJH. Section 4 introduces the data and econometric methodology. Section 5 presents the results and Section 6 concludes.",Multiple job holding as a strategy for skills development,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142518300422,March 2019,2019,Research Article,121.0

Smoking behavior generally depends on environmental, congenital, or social factors. These factors, however, do not only affect smoking behavior but also the wages of these individuals. To isolate the effect of smoking on wages, we control for individual heterogeneity using panel data to verify the existence of such an effect.==== in the fixed effects model and several robustness checks, the results show that smoking has no statistically significant effect on wage rate. This suggests that smoking does not directly affect wages; rather, unobserved individual heterogeneity (other factors influencing both smoking and wages) leads to wage differences between smokers and nonsmokers. Nevertheless, smoking can affect wages in the long run through health problems. The nine-year panel data used in this research, however, is insufficient to capture the long-term indirect health effects. Thus, future research should consider analyzing indirect health effects using panel data spread across a wider time frame.","This paper aims to verify the effect of smoking on hourly wages using Japanese panel data to determine whether encouraging people to quit smoking is an effective way to increase productivity.====The interest in the slogan “Keep working after retirement” has been growing in Japan, especially after Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott, the authors of the book ====, stated that people will keep working into their 70s and 80s as they live longer. The Japanese government has also recommended that companies conduct re-employment drives or give employment extensions to create job opportunities for elderly people. In order to keep working after 70, it is necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle.====Japan is noted for the longevity of its population. The average life expectancy for males and females in 2016 was 80.98 years and 87.14 years, respectively, according to the Outline of Vital Statistics in Japan (trends up to 2016).==== The average healthy life expectancy—the span of life without any constraints—is about 10 years less than the average life expectancy; it was 72.14 years for males and 74.79 years for females in 2016. However, the national cost of medical care was 42.364 trillion JPY in 2015 and has increased year by year.==== Of this cost, 47.8% (20.251 trillion JPY) is incurred on people over the age of 70. The cost is expected to increase in the future because of the longevity and low birthrate in Japan. Although Japan still enjoys a high level of life expectancy, it is important to promote the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle for a longer life and work tenure.====What is causing the increase in people's medical expenditure? The greatest share in the national cost of medical care is that of circulatory diseases; it was about 19.9% (5.982 trillion JPY) in 2015. For people above the age of 65, circulatory diseases are still the biggest reason for incurring medical expenditure (25.5% or 4.687 trillion JPY). As is generally known, one of the major causes of circulatory diseases is smoking.==== On January 15th, 2018, The Research Group of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reported that smoking caused the death of more than 1 million people in 2014 because of diseases, such as cancer, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Further, medical expenses of about 1.5 trillion JPY are incurred on the treatment of passive smokers and these constitute 3.7% of the national cost of medical care. Among smokers, the medical cost of cancer was the largest, exceeding 700 billion yen. It is obvious that smoking leads to huge economic costs in Japan. Governments have implemented policies to reduce the economic costs of smoking, such as increasing taxes on cigarettes, confining smokers to smoking areas expected to encourage smokers to quit, and protecting non-smokers from exposure to passive smoking.====Speaking of passive smoking, the first research about passive smoking in Japan (a government-commissioned research), Hirayama (1981) pointed out that passive smoking may cause lung cancer in non-smokers by using a sample of Japanese non-smoking married females aged 40 and above. Since then, government has accumulated knowledge about passive smoking for a long time, and research groups reported the national cost of medical care for passive smokers is more than 300 billion JPY and the number of patients is 250,000. This is a huge number. To protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of smoking, the government has drafted a legislation on passive smoking prevention. It was passed on July 18, 2018 and it will become effective from April 2020.====As knowledge of the negative effects of smoking are widely known and several policies have come into force, it is necessary to estimate the economic cost of smoking and the economic benefits of reduced smoking by using a cost-benefit analysis of smoking (The World Bank, 1999: Chapter 6) in order to evaluate the policies. In addition to being a major cause of the rising healthcare costs for smokers, smoking also degrades labor productivity through its negative effect on workers’ health; this is because of absenteeism and lost future incomes caused by early retirement owing to health-related reasons.==== Furthermore, decreasing levels of nicotine in the blood lowers smokers’ concentration, leading them to increase their smoking during working hours to compensate. Nicotine is also highly addictive, thus extending its negative impact on smokers’ health. Though the issue of passive smoking attracts a great deal of attention these days in Japan, it is important to first identify the effect of smoking on smokers themselves. Therefore, we mainly focus on smokers in this paper and leave the research about the effect of passive smoking for non-smokers as future work.====According to previous studies, there are two themes (smoking and absent days, smoking and wage levels) in cost-benefit evaluations of smoking. In this paper, we focus on smoking and wage levels to verify the effect of smoking on average hourly wages. Research into this topic in the 1990s showed that smokers have statistically significant lower wage levels than nonsmokers (Levine et al., 1997), whereas research in the 2000s showed no wage differences between smokers and nonsmokers (Lye and Hirschberg, 2004, Yuda, 2011). In this study, we used Japanese panel data to control for considerable individual time-invariant endogeneity to evaluate causes behind wage differences between smokers and nonsmokers. Additionally, we estimated the fixed effect instrumental (FE-IV) estimation to control for individual time-variant endogeneity using the tax increases on cigarettes. Furthermore, we checked the robustness of the results with some additional analysis.====The results of our research indicate that smoking has no effect on hourly wages for either men or women. There is a statistically significant 9.4% difference in wages between male smokers and nonsmokers in the ordinary least squares (OLS) model, but it disappears in the fixed effect (FE) model. Neither the OLS nor the FE models show statistically significant results for women. This indicates that wages do not change when people quit smoking. If the FE estimates are the result of the effect of smoking on wages, then our results clearly show that this is not statistically significant, and that wage differences among smokers and nonsmokers come from factors besides smoking.====However, this does not mean smoking-related policies or campaigns, such as increasing taxes on cigarettes or confining smokers to smoking areas, will have no real effect of reducing the number smokers and increasing productivity through the promotion of health in Japan. The first stage of the FE-IV estimates showed that the tax increase on cigarettes in 2006 reduced the number of men who smoked a pack (20 cigarettes) daily by 8.5%, and a tax increase in 2010, by a further 14% (The results for females are similar). Although there are no statistically significant results for the negative effect of smoking on wages in the FE-IV model, the first-stage results suggest that a strongly enforced smoking policy will have a positive impact on reducing the number of smokers in Japan. One possible reason that this study found that smoking had no effect on wages is the use of short-term data. What is clear is that smoking has negative health consequences, and deteriorating health leads to low wage levels (Yuda, 2010). Therefore, we cannot dismiss the effect of smoking on wages through negative health effects. This study uses only nine years of data, which may be a limiting factor in analyzing the effects of smoking as a mediator of health conditions. According to Charvat et al. (2018), “the risk of lung cancer occurrence decreased with time since cessation of smoking”, indicating any health impact of quitting smoking may take a long time to show up. Future studies may explore the relationship between smoking and wages more concretely if long-term panel data is used.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the literature, Section 3 introduces the data and presents descriptive statistics, Section 4 explains the method and discusses the main results, and Section 5 shows the results of the robustness check. Section 6 discuss the relationship between smoking and alcohol consumption or exercise.

Existing surveys find that regular employees are more likely to be victimized by MH than are non-regular employees. Using Fairlie’s decomposition method, this study decomposes the regular/non-regular gap in the rate of victimization into such factors as education, tenure, voluntary resignation, pressure to work overtime, clear job description, and male-dominated workplace. I find that voluntary resignation and pressure to work overtime are the two largest factors that explain the regular/non-regular gap in the risk of MH. I also find that organizations that provide clear job descriptions have low risk of MH. The results suggest that organizations could reduce the risk of MH by clarifying individual employees’ roles and by highly evaluating employees who execute their duties without overtime.","There are large gender gaps in Japan’s labor market. The female labor force participation rate is 78% of that of men. Women earn only 52% of what men earn. These figures are around the lowest among developed countries (World Economic Forum, 2017). Recently, however, the female employment rate has increased. The employment rate of women aged 15–64 years increased from 56.7% in 2000 to 67.4% in 2017, while that of men of the same age increased from 81.0% to 82.9% (Statistics Bureau, 2018a). As a result, the gender gap diminished from 24.2 percentage points to 15.5 percentage points.====One reason for this improvement is that the number of women who quit their jobs around childbirth has declined. Less than 25% of women whose first child was younger than 12 months old were in the labor market between 1985 and 2000, and the rate was stable during the period. However, it started to increase around 2000 reaching 38.3% in 2010–2014. The job retention rate of women after the birth of their first child increased from 38.1% in 1995–1999 to 53.0% in 2010–2014 (National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, 2016).====These findings imply that the number of pregnant women in the workplace has increased substantially in the last decade and a half. As women who retain their jobs after childbirth increase, “maternity harassment” (MH) has started to attract attention. MH is discrimination or harassment in workplaces against women based on pregnancy or childbirth, which might violate laws that aim to achieve gender equality and maternity protection. Its nearest English equivalent is “pregnancy discrimination.” The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (JTUC) implemented a survey on MH in 2013, and found that one-quarter of working women who have children claim to have been victims of MH (JTUC, 2013).====In 2015, the Supreme Court decided that the demotion of a woman who took parental leave was invalid. This news shocked employers, since they had assumed that demotion was allowed if there was no position suitable for women who came back from their parental leave. The government, which is eager to utilize the female labor force to increase Japan’s economic growth rate, has also been influenced by this decision. The Law of Childcare Leave was revised in 2016 so that employers had to implement measures to prevent MH. In 2016, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) started a campaign to prevent MH.====As the number of pregnant employees increases, the number of MH cases is likely to increase until firms create workplace environments in which pregnant women may work comfortably. There is a prejudicial view that the productivity of pregnant women is low. Although it may be the case that pregnant women cannot work as hard as ordinary employees during a certain period of pregnancy, proper measures would, in the long run, make it possible for them to sustain their contribution to the organization at a high level.====Although MH can have a negative effect on women’s health, income, and careers, there has been little research on this topic except in the area of law (e.g., Honeyball, 2000; Barnard and Rapp, 2005; Tominaga, 2013). This is in clear contrast to the rich volume of literature on sexual harassment in the fields of psychology, sociology, and business (for literature reviews, see Welsh, 1999; Willness et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2008; McDonald, 2012).====Nonetheless, there are two notable sociological studies on MH, McDonald et al. (2008) and Sugimoto (2009). The former uses data compiled from counseling by community centers in Queensland, Australia to analyze the background of MH and how the cases are solved. The latter analyzes causes of MH, using interviews with victims of MH. The samples of these studies are limited to victims of MH. These studies do not compare women who are victimized and those who are not.====There are several online surveys on MH in Japan. The JTUC implemented surveys in 2013, 2014, and 2015. The Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training (JILPT) implemented a survey in 2015. Among these surveys, the JTUC (2015) and the JILPT (2016) find a curious fact that regular employees are more likely to be victimized than non-regular employees are.==== The rate of victimization of regular employees is 34.9% and that of non-regular employees is 24.4%, according to the JTUC (2015), while these rates are 22.3% and 15.4%, respectively, in the JILPT (2016). Thus, it is of interest to investigate why regular employees have a higher risk than non-regular employees do even though regular employees have higher education, longer tenure, higher wages, and more stable employment contract.====The aim of this study is three-fold. First, I compare the victimization rate of regular and non-regular employees for 11 types of MH, in order to clarify the regular/non-regular gap in the rate of victimization by MH.====Second, I estimate the probability of being victimized by MH. This would clarify what characteristics of employees and workplaces are correlated with the risk of MH. I am particularly interested in the relationship between the human resource management and the victimization rate, and discuss how organizations can reduce their risk of MH.====Third, I decompose the regular/non-regular gap in the rate of victimization into several factors in line with Fairlie (1999, 2005, 2017), which is a non-linear version of Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973). The regular/non-regular gap in the victimization rate is decomposed into the gap in endowments, such as education, tenure, voluntary resignation, pressure to work overtime, clear job description, and male-dominated workplace.====This is the first study that uses microdata to analyze the characteristics of women and workplaces that are associated with the risk of MH. The study contributes to the literature by revealing factors that affect the risk of MH, and by providing implications for human resource management.====The major findings are as follows. First, regular employees have a significantly higher victimization rate of MH than non-regular employees do. While 22.8% of regular employees claim to be victimized, 14.3% of non-regular employees do so. Non-regular employees have a higher victimization rate in only 1 out of 11 types of MH, that is, dismissal.====Second, workplaces where employees feel it is difficult to leave the workplace at the scheduled time if colleagues are still working have significantly high risk of MH. On the other hand, workplaces where employees feel the job description is clear have significantly low risk. These findings imply that organizations could reduce the risk of MH by clarifying individual employees’ roles, and highly evaluating employees who efficiently execute their duties.====Third, the voluntary resignation and pressure to work overtime are the two biggest factors that contribute to the regular/non-regular gaps in the victimization ratio. Clear job description makes a small but significant contribution to the gap. On the other hand, education and tenure reduce the gap in the victimization rate only for non-verbal MH. Male dominated workplaces do not contribute to the gap.====The structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the differences between regular and non-regular employees in Japan’s labor market. Section 3 explains the research method. The hypotheses are presented in Section 4. The data and measurement are explained in Section 5. The estimation results and decompositions are provided in Section 6.

Analysis is performed at the tariff line level by constructing concordance tables for 9-digit tariff line codes. Most evaluation studies of trade liberalisation policies, and especially of preferential trade agreements, struggle with endogeneity and reverse causality, i.e., a growing trade with a country might have caused a formation of FTA with that country.==== On the other hand, DFQF systems have an inherently low level of endogeneity because of their exogenous nature in that the aim of DFQF is development of LDCs, i.e., it is not driven by an increasing trade value, and that the developed WTO member countries cannot choose which LDC countries and which products are eligible.

In addition, an increase of a direct centrality measure (i.e., degree or eigenvector centrality) indicates that the connections among cross-shareholdings become denser in a neighboring area and increase credit contagion risk. By contrast, an increase of an indirect centrality measure (i.e., eccentricity or farness centrality) shows that the connections among cross-shareholdings become dispersed at the global level and decrease credit contagion risk. The results could provide senior managers with an important signal for credit risk management related to cross-shareholdings.","In Japan, listed companies have traditionally adopted a cross-shareholding corporate governance structure for many reasons. Japanese companies use this practice to minimize sales variations under long trade relationships, reduce transaction costs, lower the cost of capital, and enable stable management without the distraction of noisy shareholders. However, cross-shareholding was introduced to protect a company from a hostile takeover by a foreign company, an issue that first arose in the 1960s, when the capital market was liberalized. In Japan, hostile takeovers of listed companies are rare. There are only a few examples of successful takeover bids of listed Japanese companies: Q and Company acquired CARCHS Holdings in 2007, M&FC (a Korean company) acquired Nihon Seimitsu Co in 2007, and Seiwa acquired Nippon Gear Company in 2015. Since then, foreign companies’ shareholdings have increased significantly, peaking at the end of March 2015 (Fig. 1). Since the funds invested in securities via cross-shareholding originally served as a business investment, they cannot serve as an anti-takeover measure. Consequently, cross-shareholding runs contrary to returning profits to common stockholders.====Specifically, Miyajima and Nitta (2011) reported that cross-shareholding among Japanese companies decreased between 1997 and 2004, owing to lender banks selling shares during the Heisei financial crisis. By contrast, Ikeda et al. (2018) reported that both cross-shareholding and stable shareholding were essentially constant between 2004 and 2014. These studies imply that the network structures of cross-shareholdings among listed Japanese companies could have had different features before and after the banking crisis in the late 1990s. The sample period in this study is represented by the fiscal years (FY) 2008–2015, when the degree of cross-shareholdings were essentially constant. However, the degree of cross-shareholding was less tight during FY 2008–2015 than in the 1990s.====Triggered by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, many companies with cross-held stocks suffered significant capital losses, with some booking impairment losses. This reduced the outstanding cross-shareholdings of listed Japanese companies by 1.7% at the end of March 2009 compared to the previous year. The corporate disclosure of “policy ownership securities” (i.e., cross-held shares) in securities reports was not legally mandatory at the end of March 2009 and disclosure was enforced only at the end of March 2010. However, the cross-shareholding ratio increased gradually and peaked at the end of March 2016 (Fig. 2). This figure does not reflect the shares held by blockholders, such as banks, insurers, securities companies, investment trusts, and pension funds. If these shares were considered, the cross-shareholding ratio would have been around 8% at the end of March 2008.====In response to investors’ recent requests for highly transparent management, Japanese companies adopted “Japan's Corporate Governance Code” (JCGC) in June 2015 (Council of Experts Concerning the Corporate Governance Code, 2015), which requires companies to explain the purposes and reasons for holding shares of listed stocks. In addition, the code demands that companies adopt standards with respect to the voting rights as to their cross-shareholdings.====Principle 1.4 of the JCGC stipulates the following policies related to cross-shareholdings. When companies hold the shares of other listed companies as cross-shareholdings, they should disclose their policy with respect to their holdings. In addition, the board should examine the mid- to long-term economic rationale and outlook of major cross-shareholdings on an annual basis, considering both associated risks and returns. The annual examination would result in the board's detailed explanation of the objectives of and rationale for cross-shareholdings.====Considering the effects of this code on Japanese companies’ cross-shareholding practices, this study assesses the network structure of cross-shareholdings among all listed Japanese companies. First, I analyze the interconnectedness in the cross-shareholding network using various network centrality measures (Jackson, 2010, Kanno, 2015). The network analysis is based on data for the bilateral shares of all listed Japanese companies from the Nikkei NEEDS Financial QUEST database. Hence, the dataset covers almost all cross-shareholding contracts among listed Japanese companies.====Second, I conduct a credit risk analysis using a panel regression with a logistic regression model. In this credit risk analysis, I focus not on the return on investment, but the counterparty credit risk in terms of cross-shareholdings. The adoption of this view differentiates this study from extant studies related to cross-shareholdings.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on cross-shareholdings and interconnectedness in various financial networks. Section 3 describes the network structure of cross-shareholdings. Section 4 presents the credit risk analysis via panel regression, and Section 5 concludes the paper.",Network structures and credit risk in cross-shareholdings among listed Japanese companies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142517300993,March 2019,2019,Research Article,125.0

Our model-free approach not only provides the term structure of the liquidity premium, but also captures the impact of illiquidity events and the illiquidity condition of the Japanese fixed-income market. We empirically show that the long-term factor of the liquidity premium curve is driven by the volatility of the short-term rate. The liquidity measure is provided publicly for future applications.","This paper examines market liquidity based on Japanese government-guaranteed bonds (JGGBs). The basic idea is quite simple. We interpret the yield spread between JGGBs and Japanese government bonds (JGBs) as a liquidity premium. This is because the Japanese government explicitly guarantees JGGBs and they have considerably less liquidity than JGBs. Thus, the spread between JGGBs and JGBs is a direct measure of the liquidity premium. We refer to this liquidity premium as the J-liquidity measure.====In this paper, we empirically show that this measure is useful for capturing the aggregate conditions of the liquidity and the liquidity crisis, which the other measures cannot always capture. In addition, we also attempt to reveal the drivers of the term structure of the illiquidity premium. Based on Kempf et al. (2012), we use vector autoregression (VAR) with exogenous variables, and show that the long-term factor of the liquidity premium curve is driven by the volatility of the short-term rate.====Understanding market liquidity is an important task for several reasons. An abundant literature has explored the asset-pricing implications of liquidity theoretically and empirically. Especially during financial crises, measurement of liquidity has great importance for central bankers because monetary policy could restore market function when the crisis stems from illiquidity. Recently, market participants have become concerned that market liquidity is waning, and that financial institutions are no longer providing liquidity because of stricter and more complicated regulation. As Duffie (2012) points out, there is a need for the assessment of a cost-effective method in this respect, and this requires the accurate analysis of market liquidity itself.====Measuring market liquidity using the yield spread between JGGBs and JGBs has several major advantages. First, we can estimate the liquidity measure directly from asset prices without imposing a specific model. This model-free approach provides a robust liquidity measure, whereas other approaches require a specific model to decompose liquidity from other factors such as credit risk (Longstaff et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2007). Second, this approach extracts the liquidity “premium” and this includes the forward-looking component of liquidity. As this measure is constructed using forward-looking variables, the premium should include investors’ expectations of future market liquidity, thus enabling us to capture the liquidity premium accurately, especially during a period of financial crisis. Third, this liquidity measure can provide the information about the term structure of the liquidity premium, which the other measure cannot capture explicitly.====Our paper relates to several existing strands of research. For example, Longstaff (2004) examines the spread between US government-guaranteed bonds (RefCorp) and US Treasury bonds to capture the flight-to-liquidity premium in the US Treasury market. Likewise, Kempf et al. (2012) use the spread between Pfandbriefe and German government bonds (Bunds) to extract the term structure of the liquidity premium, while Monfort and Renne (2014) and Schuster and Uhrig-Homburg (2015) employ the guaranteed bonds issued by Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) to calculate the KfW-Bund spread. Lastly, Schwarz (2017) constructs a K-measure using KfW bonds and provides a useful index on her website.====The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we construct a liquidity measure using the spread of JGGBs and JGBs (J-liquidity measure), which we provide publicly through our website (====). We also elaborate upon the characteristics of the J-liquidity measure and assert that this measure adequately captures illiquidity events by implementing structural change tests.====Second, we argue that the J-liquidity measure has better properties as an aggregate liquidity measure, compared with the other more conventional liquidity measures. In fact, the J-liquidity measure spikes up much more prominently than other liquidity measures during a liquidity crisis, whereas other common liquidity measures such as turnover and the on-the-run premium cannot even capture the effect of a financial crisis. Furthermore, we show that the J-liquidity measure also has a high correlation with several other liquidity measures (including the bid-ask spread, Amihud measure, and yield curve fitting noise), implying our measure captures the illiquidity condition of the fixed-income market overall.====Third, we analyze the drivers of the term structure of the liquidity premium in Japan’s fixed-income market and find that the long-term factor of the liquidity premium is influenced by the short-term rate volatility.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the construction of the J-liquidity measure and provides the results of a structural change test of trends in this measure. Section 3 compares the J-liquidity measure with the other measures of liquidity, demonstrating that the J-liquidity measure has good properties for capturing both illiquidity events and aggregate market liquidity. In Section 4, we use the VAR framework to empirically pursue the drivers of the term structure of the liquidity premium.

Moreover, in response to the increase in the number of non-regular employees and turnover rates, workers need to have greater incentive to make the self-motivated investment in themselves for their self-protection. In this study, we first estimate the effects of workers’ self-motivated investment in themselves on wage rates. Next, we explore who is likely to participate in which training type and accordingly estimate the effects of the self-motivated investment on wage rates by training type. Our estimates controlling for individual-level fixed-effects indicate that the return is significantly positive and particularly high for practical training related to workers’ current jobs, and regular workers tend to self-select these higher-returns programs, while non-regular workers are more likely to enroll in lower-returns programs, such as schooling. This trend in investment in oneself could potentially increase the wage inequality between regular and non-regular workers through the self-selection of training types. Our estimates reveal that receiving the training and education benefit raises the likelihood for workers to participate in a high-return training program regardless of whether they are non-regular or regular workers. This suggests that government benefits on self-investment change workers’ self-selection of training type and serve to promote practical trainings that lead to high returns.","It is well known that Japanese companies used to offer education and training to their employees intently against a backdrop of the implicit long-term employment that had long been customary in Japan.==== The country’s low job turnover, labor unions organized by companies, and seniority-based wage systems enabled companies to have a long-term perspective and engage in human capital investment to improve their employees’ skills. However, from the 1990s onward, a prolonged economic slump and intensifying competition has led to a decline in the amount of money that Japanese companies spend on the development or education and training of internal human capital.====Many papers have pointed out such a decrease in human capital investment. For instance, according to Miyagawa et al. (2016), the total amount of investment in human capital at all private companies in 2012 was about 20% of the total amount invested in 1991. In addition, Hara (2007) demonstrates that compared with the early 1970s, off-the-job training (Off-JT) opportunities in Japanese companies decreased in the early 2000s.====Furthermore, the number of non-regular workers, who receive fewer opportunities for both on-the-job and off-the-job training, has been growing in Japan (Hara, 2014; Kambayashi and Kato, 2016). As non-regular work increases, job turnover rates rise, which can give workers a self-motivated incentive to invest in themselves to increase their job security. According to Toda and Higuchi (2005), the probability of participation by female part-time workers in a training course significantly dropped in the late 1990s. The number of those who seem to be outside the scope of human capital investment by firms has increased, and they may have greater needs and incentive to invest in skill development themselves. However, it is not always easy for workers to find the time or money to improve their abilities themselves. In response to the sharp drop in human capital investment by companies, in 1998 the Japanese government set up a training and education benefit (TEB) system to provide financial aid to individuals who invest in improving their skills. The system provides cash benefits to workers who have paid for, participated in, and completed programs designated by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. While many developed countries have expanded or maintained their apprenticeship systems that support individuals through private sectors, Japan chose to increase its direct subsidies to individuals for skill improvement.====In this study, we employ unique individual panel data to estimate the effect of participation in trainings on wage rates controlling for fixed effects, and we explore individuals’ selection of training types. Our estimates indicate that voluntary vocational education and training, particularly practical training related to employees’ current jobs, significantly increases wage rates. Further, while regular workers tend to self-select higher-returns programs, non-regular ones select lower-returns programs, such as schooling. We also estimate the causal impact of receiving the TEB on participation in each training type by performing an instrumental variable (IV) estimation. The results reveal that receiving the TEB enhances the probability of participating in higher returns programs, irrespective of workers’ current position. These findings suggest that the TEB mitigates economic bipolarization caused by the self-selection problem concerning training choices.====There are a few studies that have examined the impact of the state-sponsored human capital investment on wages. For example, Finegold and Soskice (1988) explore training policies in the United Kingdom and find that they deliver little wage returns for participants. Using cross-section survey data, Abe et al. (2005) demonstrate that human capital investments subsidized by the Japanese government have a limited impact on wages. Heckman et al. (1999) examine the impacts of labor market policies, such as job training, job search assistance, and job subsidies, on unemployed and economically disadvantaged workers. Holmes (2017) explains that state-run or -funded training programs are only imperfect substitutes for employer-provided trainings, unless there is a guarantee that the skills will be applied in employees’ jobs.====This paper is the first one to explore the impact of the TEB on the self-selection of training type using individual panel data. Our data include rich information on the contents of training in which each worker participated, which enables us to examine “who chooses what kind of training” in detail.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the TEB system in Japan. Section 3 presents the empirical model, and Section 4 offers a brief description of the data. Section 5 shows the empirical results.

Compared to a similar unlisted firm, a listed firm has a lower marginal product of capital on average and more new borrowings during recessions. Theoretically, we argue that these are the key pieces of evidence that indicate less tight financial constraints for the listed firms than the unlisted firms. However, the listed firms do not borrow more on average over time. They rather maintain a lower leverage so that they can mitigate the borrowing constraints. We also find that the listed firms do not face lower ====.","We confirm that listing to a stock exchange can mitigate financial constraints of a firm, using Japanese firm-level data of 20 years, 1995-2014. Specifically, compared to a similar unlisted firm, a listed firm has a lower marginal product of capital on average over time and more new borrowings in recessions. Theoretically, we argue that these are the most important variables that uncover differential financial frictions between listed and unlisted firms. Moreover, empirically, we find that the listed firms do not borrow more over time but that they rather maintain lower leverage on average to mitigate the borrowing constraints. These findings are stronger for manufacturing-only sample, financially struggling firms, and firms without a majority owner in both fixed effect panel regressions and propensity score matching estimates.====With more detailed data becoming available and further improvements in computational powers, studies on unlisted firms have been flourishing recently. A natural question arises: How are the listed and the unlisted firms different? Our interest, in particular, is to look into the financial constraint faced by these firms. After considering a theoretical framework, we focus our attention on relatively simple variables based on the corporate financial statements, that is, the marginal product of capital, borrowings, and leverage.====If we could utilize the stock price data to all the sample, we could estimate financial frictions in a sharper way, as done in Claessens et al. (2014). Unfortunately, the stock price data for the unlisted firms are not available. An alternative could be to run a so-called cash-flow-sensitivity regression or its variants. However, we decided not to do so due to known identification problems. The cash-flow-sensitivity analysis was introduced by Fazzari et al. (1988) and since then followed in many studies. They identify financing constraints as the sensitivity of investments to firm cash flows in regressions, while controlling for growth opportunities, often represented by Tobin’s ====. However, as Gomes (2001) shows, in the presence of financial transaction costs, such regressions face serious identification problems because ==== reflects not only growth opportunities but also frictions (e.g., external financing constraints). And, again, in our case, we do not have stock price data. Moreover, with auto-correlated productivity shocks (“growth opportunities”), current profits contain information about future profitability, so that the sensitivity of investment to current profits may be a legitimate response to expected future profitability, not just reflecting difficulties in financing.====Some researchers find that listing enables firms to mitigate financial constraints. Gilje and Thaillard (2016), based on panel regressions, show that listed natural gas firms in the US have higher sensitivity to gas price movements (i.e., growth opportunities) than the unlisted rivals in the same industry. The difference is more pronounced in shale gas investments, which are more capital intensive. For British firms, Saunders and Steffen (2011) find that the listed firms enjoy lower bank loan rates based on the propensity score matching estimates. In their European cross-country study, Mortal and Reisel (2013) report that the listed firms have higher investment sensitivity on growth opportunities and such tendencies are higher for countries with more developed stock markets. They find so based on propensity score matching primarily on total assets but, instead of ====, they use sales growth as a (presumably noisier) proxy for the growth opportunity.====Others find that the listing tightens financial constraints. This is theoretically possible if agency problems worsen under sparse ownership (e.g., Stein, 1989). For US firms, Asker et al. (2015) run the panel regressions and show that US listed firms are more short-termist, that is, they are less sensitive to growth opportunities, proxied by sales growth. And, this difference is larger for listed firms as their stock prices are more sensitive to their earnings reports. Sheen (2016), based on panel regressions, shows that the US listing firms in chemical industries have a lower sensitivity of capacity investment on demand shocks, which are identified by joint movements in prices and quantities of specific products.====Mixed evidences sometimes are reported even by the same authors. For British firms, Brav (2009) in his panel regressions shows that listed firms have lower leverage, but with lower fluctuations in capital structure, likely because of lower equity issuance costs. In their European cross country study, Goyal et al. (2011) also, based on panel regressions, report that listed firms have lower leverage, but with more active management on leverage (presumably by lower financing costs). They also find that this difference between the listed and the unlisted firms are more pronounced in countries with stronger creditor rights. For Japanese firms, Orihara (2014) presents univariate pictures that show the listed firms have lower investments on average but with lower fluctuations in investment over business cycles. Orihara and Isobe (2014), based on panel regressions, report that the listed firms have lower leverage, though with minimal control variables.====Related literature studies IPOs. Above-mentioned Asker et al. (2015) report no differences between recently listed companies and always listed companies during their sample years except for abnormal movements in a few years before and after the IPOs. For Japanese firms, Miyakawa and Takizawa (2013) and Hosono and Takizawa (2015) focus on IPOs and confirm abnormal movements in profits and other variables in a few years before and after the IPOs. Also related is firm exits from listing. Bharath et al. (2010) show that US firms actively decide to go private based on costs and benefits being publicly traded. Note, however, that active exits from listing are rare among Japanese firms, which are our sample. Moreover, as we discuss in the next section on data and in the later section on robustness checks, we make sure that our analysis is free from entry and exit issues.",Listing and financial constraints,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142518300227,March 2019,2019,Research Article,128.0
