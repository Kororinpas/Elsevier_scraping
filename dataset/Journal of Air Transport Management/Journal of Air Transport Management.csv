It is important to develop accurate methods for forecasting the flow of passengers to formulate relevant operational plans and the schedule of airports. Even though empirical evidence has shown that forecast combination can improve the prediction accuracy of single-model forecasts, no study in the literature on transportation to date has examined the performance of such combinations to predict the demand for air transport. In light of the usefulness of grey prediction, which does not require applying any statistical test to examine the data at hand, and relationships among forecasts to be reckoned with, this study proposes using the nonadditive Choquet fuzzy integral to nonlinearly synthesize forecasts from four commonly used univariate grey prediction models into composite forecasts. The results of experiments confirmed that the risk arising from the incorrect choice of ==== can be eliminated by using forecast combinations. The proposed combination method based on grey prediction significantly outperformed the other competitors considered.","Due to the importance of accurate forecasts of passenger flow for both transportation policymakers and business practitioners, a large body of research has been dedicated to developing forecasting methods in the transportation literature. Forecasting the demand for air transport is also attracting increasing attention from the transportation industry because it can help air transport practitioners manage the system of transport through the implementation of appropriate operational plans and related strategies (Jin et al., 2020).====Passenger demand forecasting methods can be grouped into three categories: time series models, causal econometric approaches, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods (Dantas et al., 2017). Time series models relate past observations to the current forecasted variable. Commonly used models of this kind include the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (Andreana et al., 2021; Anvari et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2009; Gong et al., 2014; Tsui et al., 2014) and smoothing techniques (Samagaio and Wolters, 2010). Econometric approaches relate independent variables with the demand for passengers. A number of such approaches have been used to forecast the demand for passengers, such as the logit model (Lu et al., 2020), autoregressive distributed lag models, time-varying parameter, and vector autoregressive model (Fildes et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2019). Both time series models and econometric approaches usually assume a linear relationship among the relevant variables. Furthermore, to deliver adequate performance, such statistics as the stationarity test are required by these methods to examine the available data (Liou and Tzeng, 2012; Tzeng and Shen, 2017). However, the requirement for agreement between the data and certain statistical properties may not be realistic for empirical data (Jiang and Hu, 2022; Liou, 2013; Peng and Tzeng, 2013; Tzeng and Shen, 2017). Moreover, the presumption of a linear relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable appears to deviate from reality (Sun et al., 2019).====Because time series models and econometric approaches have a limited ability to capture the nonlinear characteristics of the demand for passengers (Saayman and Botha, 2017; Jin et al., 2020), many studies have instead used AI-based methods, which are adaptable and nonlinear, and thus can approximate to arbitrary functions (Sun et al., 2019). Recent examples of forecasting the demand for transport include the use of neural networks (Li et al., 2019, Li et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2018), support vector regression (Shi et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2018), deep learning (He et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021), ==== spatiotemporal modeling (Wei et al., 2022). Some studies have extracted meaningful patterns from the series of data and applied AI-based methods to integrate them and generate forecasts (Jin et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2019; Wei and Chen, 2012).====Despite of the effectiveness of AI-based methods on passenger demand forecasting, a large number of observations are required by them to provide reasonably accurate forecasts (Shahrabi et al., 2013). In the context of machine learning, some empirical evidence has shown that well-behaved learning curves with respect to the accuracy and the size of the training set often have the shape of a power law (Viering and Loog, 2021). By contrast, grey prediction, an AI-based method, can capture the structure of nonlinear relationships based on a small sample size without requiring that the data satisfy any statistical property (Liu and Yao, 2017, Liu et al., 2017). In light of this advantage, grey prediction has been widely applied to many fields, such as for predicting the demand for energy (Hu and Wang, 2022; Wu et al., 2019), vehicle emissions (Xie et al., 2020), and traffic flow (Xiao et al., 2017). However, little attention has been paid to using grey prediction models to forecast the demand for passengers in transportation, with some exceptions such as the work by Chen et al. (2019), Hsu and Wen (1998), and Li and Han (2022).====Point forecasting dominates the literature on forecasting the demand for passengers. No single model has been found to be superior to all others in all situations (Li et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2021). Relying on a single forecasting model may incur the risk of the failure of forecasting because it may generate the best forecasts in one time period but fail in other periods (Sun et al., 2021). Combination forecasting is a feasible approach for reducing such risk by synthesizing forecasts generated by different models based on weighting schemes (Qiu et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2017). Empirical evidence has shown that combining forecasting can improve accuracy of point forecasts of the demand for tourism (Cang, 2014; Hu and Wu, 2022; Shen et al., 2011; Song et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2021; Wu and Blake, 2022). The combination methods can be classified into linear and nonlinear methods (Cang, 2014). Linear combination methods, such as weighted average, assume that the sources of information are not preferentially independent of one another. However, because such an assumption ignores interactions among the inputs (Liou and Tzeng, 2012; Tzeng and Huang, 2011), it is reasonable to use nonlinear combination methods that consider preferential dependence among the inputs while combining individual forecasts. The commonly used nonlinear combination methods such as support vector regression (SVR) (Cang, 2014), the radial-basis function network (RBFN) (Zheng et al., 2006), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (Cang, 2014; Wei and Chen, 2012), have shown to be more accurate than linear combinations. The nonlinear Choquet fuzzy integral, which considers interactions among the inputs as well, has been widely applied to many fields as well, such as alternative assessment (Liou et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2020) and classifier ensembles (Batista et al., 2022). Despite the usefulness of the Choquet integral for performance evaluation, little attention has been paid to its use in forecasting the passenger demand, with some exceptions such as tourism demand forecasting by Hu et al. (2021), and Hu and Wu (2022), among others. In summary, despite the advantages of combining forecasting models, little research has been devoted to this in the context of passenger demand forecasting, with some exceptions such as Guo et al., 2019, Guo et al., 2019, Ni et al. (2017), Tan et al. (2009) and Zhai et al. (2020).====To provide more accurate forecasts of air passenger demand for policymakers on transportation and businesses, this research aims to fill the aforementioned research gap by developing a forecast combination method for passenger demand forecasting by generating single-model forecasts from commonly used grey prediction models. The Choquet integral is then applied to nonlinearly synthesize individual forecasts into composite forecasts. To the best of our knowledge, no study in the literature on transportation to date has examined the performance of combination forecasting on air passenger demand.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed nonlinear combined model with grey prediction (NCMG), including candidate models in a combination set and GM(1, ====). Section 3 presents commonly used combination methods. Section 4 verifies forecasting accuracy of the proposed combination forecasting methods, and Section 5 summarizes the conclusions of this study.",Air passenger flow forecasting using nonadditive forecast combination with grey prediction,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000820,12 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

Taking Shijiazhuang Airport as an example, this paper studied the travel characteristics of air passengers in the airport hinterland using mobile phone signaling data. The results showed that: ① Air passengers were mainly distributed in Shijiazhuang City (about 70%), and the density of air passengers in urban area was significantly higher than that in other areas. ② The Shijiazhuang Airport had a distance decay effect, and the distance decay characteristics had obvious directivity. ③ The time spent at the airport for departing passengers was longer than that of arriving passengers. And the travel duration distribution characteristics of arriving and departing passengers presented a long-tail effect. The main reason for the distance and time decay characteristics would be that the car is the main collecting and distributing mode of Shijiazhuang Airport. Finally, we provide some recommendations to optimize the single collection and distribution mode of Shijiazhuang Airport.","Air travel is the preferred mode of transportation for long-distance travel (Pasha et al., 2020). In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic delivered the largest shock to air travel. Following the initial hit from the pandemic, air travel continues its recovery around mid-2021. International Air Transport Association (IATA) data noted that, as travel restrictions are eliminated, air passenger traffic gained momentum globally and recovered substantially during 2022, and it is anticipated that 10 billion people would expect to fly in 2050 (IATA, 2022). China is a major country in civil aviation. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), from 2014 to 2018, civil aviation passengers in China increased from 354 million to 612 million, with an average annual growth rate of 11.56% (Civil Aviation Administration of China, 2019). A large number of air passengers bring challenges to airport services and urban traffic management.====The airport hinterland is the area surrounding the airport from which it attracts its passengers (Lieshout, 2012). The travel behavior of air passengers in an airport hinterland is the landside part of the air passengers' door-to-door travel journey. Understanding the characteristics and rules of air passengers'travel behavior in the airport hinterland plays an important role in forecasting air passenger travel flows (Kim and Ryerson, 2018; Albayrak et al., 2020; Gao, 2020), preventing and controlling epidemics (Huber et al., 2021), improving airport service (Gao, 2021) and planning the urban transportation (Budd et al., 2016).====As the traditional studies mainly collected data through questionnaires and travel diaries, which were time-consuming, labor-intensive, and small-scale samples (Calabrese et al., 2013; Burrieza-Galán et al., 2022), the air passengers' travel behavior research faces some limitations. With the development of information and communication technology, big data is generated from online transactions, emails, videos, images, health records, social networking interactions, science data, sensors, and mobile phone signaling data and their applications (Sagiroglu and Sinanc, 2013). Big data has the advantages of a large amount of data and fast update speed, and it can be used to study and predict individual actions, consumer choices, disease outbreaks, and traffic patterns (George et al., 2014). Recently, researchers have begun to use big data such as transit payment transaction data (Wang et al., 2022), digital media data (Christensen, 2020), and mobile phone signaling data (Marzuoli et al., 2019) to explore air passengers travel behavior. However, research on air passenger travel behavior based on big data is still in its infancy, and its depth and breadth need to be expanded.====The travel time spent at the airport, travel duration, distance, origin and destination matrices (OD) are the frequent indexes of air passengers' travel behavior characteristics in the airport hinterland. Relevant research mainly focuses on two aspects: ① Travel behavior characteristics of individual air passengers. WiFi data is a commonly used data source for analyzing the time spent at an airport by air passengers (Huang et al., 2019), but the door-to-door travel duration and travel distance of air passengers in an airport hinterland can't be calculated with WiFi data, and many air passengers often don't connect to the WiFi of airport. To obtain the travel distance and travel duration of air passengers, some scholars begin to utilize the transit payment transaction data (Wang et al., 2022). However, the travel duration and travel distance measured by transit payment transaction data are the travel duration and travel distance between railway stations. Uber data can be operated to estimate the door-to-door travel distance and travel duration of air passengers (Monmousseau et al., 2019), but Uber data cannot capture the travel time spent at the airport. The mobile phone signaling data has become a reliable data source for the study of air passengers' travel behavior because it is rich in spatial and temporal information, with strong universality, wide coverage area, and low acquisition costs (Huang et al., 2021). Scholars employed mobile signaling data to research the travel time spent at the airport (Marzuoli et al., 2019), door-to-door travel duration, and airport hinterland area (Burrieza-Gal'al et al., 2022). ② The interactive relationship between airport and hinterland. Based on the analysis of individual travel characteristics, some scholars further investigated the interactive relationship between the airport and the hinterland. The power function (Paköz and Sakarya, 2021) and exponential function (Adler et al., 2022) were frequently used to quantitatively describe the influence of distance on the spatial interaction between the airport and the hinterland. Generally, with the increase in distance, the spatial interaction between the airport and the hinterland becomes weaker, which is called the distance decay effect (Liu et al., 2014). As the transportation infrastructure construction will affect the distance decay effect (Beria et al., 2017), and the distance decay characteristics will be different with different airports.====Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport (Shijiazhuang Airport) is a typical regional hub airport in China and an important part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei airport group. Yao et al. (2020) used mobile signaling data to classify the air passengers (arriving passengers, departing passengers and transit passengers) at this airport, and the number of identified air passengers accounted for 82.76% of the airport official statistic data (unidentified air passengers were mainly 0–14 years old and 65+ years old without mobile phones). Moreover, Yao et al. (2021) identified the travel OD of air passengers at Shijiazhuang Airport and demarcated the scope of the airport hinterland, laying a foundation for further research on the travel behavior characteristics of air passengers in the airport hinterland and further discussion on the interaction between the airport and the hinterland.====Based on mobile signaling data, this paper systematically measured the travel behavior characteristics of air passengers in the hinterland of Shijiazhuang Airport, including travel OD, travel distance, time spent at airport and travel duration time. Finally, the influence mechanisms of air passenger travel space and travel time distribution characteristics in the Shijiazhuang Airport hinterland were qualitatively discussed, and some suggestions to optimize the collection and distribution network of Shijiazhuang Airport were provided.",Study on travel behavior characteristics of air passengers in an airport hinterland,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000832,9 June 2023,2023,Research Article,1.0

Furthermore, such models when developed using mathematical optimization approaches, suffer from computational complexity that limits their practical applicability. This paper proposes a machine learning and simulation-based dynamic parking choice model for airport parking. It considers real-time variable parking demand, which influences access time and parking cost to various parking lots. Drivers ultimately decide to seek a parking lot depending on: (1) their value of time; (2) parking duration, and (3) availability of a parking lot. The model uses a Random Forest classifier to predict a driver's choice of a parking lot. The results, based on some empirical data, show that parking demand is highly correlated with a driver's decision to choose a parking lot, followed by parking duration and the driver's value of time. The model's accuracy in predicting a driver's parking choice is found to be 99.6%. The model provides real-time parking occupancy and can be very useful for managing airport parking. The model can be used for seeking a parking space by connected vehicles enabled with real-time information on parking availability at various parking locations (or garages).

A survey conducted among Polish airports showed that the assessment of the factor's significance depended not only on air traffic volume but also on the degree of airports' commitment to green practices. For airports with a high level of commitment, the most important barrier was the cost. In the case of airports with a medium level of commitment, the most significant barriers were unawareness of the potential benefits, and a low priority assigned to green practices in the airport's strategic goals. For airports with a low degree of commitment, in addition to the costs, the most important barrier was the conviction that their impact on the environment was low. The most important stimulants were the same for airports with medium and high levels of pro-environmental commitment: good financial condition, pro-environmental orientation of airport authorities, and political pressure. For the airports with a low degree of commitment, growth rates of passenger traffic were the most important stimulant. All the analyzed Polish airports saw benefits primarily in the possibility of identifying, monitoring, and reducing their negative impacts on the environment (meeting the legal and political requirements), and increasing the environmental awareness of the airport authorities and employees. In terms of managerial implications, our research has demonstrated that there is a strong need to provide expert assistance to airport authorities in the field of environmental management. The objectives of European Union policy are among the most ambitious and rigorous in the world. European airports committed to ==== carbon emissions under their control by 2050 or even earlier, and a few of them have already achieved Net Zero. Nevertheless, Polish airports undertake pro-environmental measures to a very limited extent, despite the dynamic high growth of passenger traffic, and despite being subjected to the pressure of the same European policy. In this context, support from the EU policy and domestic policy is of key importance.","Air transport is identified with negative environmental impacts, and research in this area has been conducted for many years (Penner et al., 1999). Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by airplanes, especially emissions of CO====, are among the most serious externalities generated by air transport (Čokorilo, 2016; Huderek-Glapska, 2014; Jeż, 2010). This increases the political pressure to reduce the negative impacts of air transport on the environment. As a result, a package of legislative proposals referred to as the European Green Deal (European Commission, 2019) was adopted in the European Union (EU) by the European Commission in July 2021. The European Green Deal aims at adapting the EU climate, energy, transport, and tax policies so as to achieve a reduction in net GHG emissions by 2030 by at least 55% compared to the 1990 level, so that the EU will achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Aviation is an important area in this regard.====Crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the operations of the aviation industry worldwide (Beck and Hensher, 2020; Cartenì et al., 2021; Fernandes, 2020; Luke, 2020; Warnock-Smith et al., 2021). At the same time, drastic reduction in air transport mobility directly led to significant reductions in aviation-related CO==== emissions (Nižetić, 2020). The challenges as well as the emerging opportunities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic thus contributed to the intensification of pro-environmental measures in the air transport sector, as part of coping with uncertainty following the COVID-19 pandemic (Calderon-Tellez and Herrera, 2021). The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also become an additional factor stimulating the governments of individual countries, and in particular the EU, to adopt a more restrictive environmental policy for air transport. A discussion arised about the need to implement regulations that would force development of a system of flights that is in line with the environmental goals (Willsher, 2021), also in the context of financial support that was provided to the aviation sector during the COVID-19 pandemic (Macilree and Duval, 2020), which can be used to introduce more stringent environmental targets (Abate et al., 2020).====Airports are perceived as local sources of environmental impacts (Postorino and Mantecchini, 2014). As a result of political pressure, more and more airports around the world implement sustainability strategies and continue them despite the short-term turbulences associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (Hemmings et al., 2021).====The key area of sustainable airport development is the pursuit of the green airport model. As indicated by (Sameh and dos Santos, 2018), growth of airports should be a green growth in which an increase in capacity is not achieved at the cost of negative environmental impacts.====The environmental management systems (standards) and environmental certification programs are important management tools to support the efforts taken by airports to reduce the climate change impacts of aviation. These tools along with other types of ecological rating systems, are applied by airports around the world. Universal environmental management systems based on ISO14000 are becoming a standard in airport management (Comendador et al., 2019). In the field of green design and planning (environmental building systems), building certification systems such as LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design), and BREEAM (Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method) are increasingly used (Doan et al., 2017). More and more attention is paid to the issues of Green Airport Design Evaluation (GrADE) as a method and tool needed in planning air transport infrastructure (Ferrulli, 2016).====In recent years, however, the reduction in CO==== emissions is perceived to be the key indicator of achieving environmental sustainability and the strategic area of airport environmental management. Therefore, there was a need to create tools for the aviation sector to support airports in reducing CO==== emissions. This role is played by the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) certification program, developed by Airports Council International (ACI), the only institutionally-endorsed, carbon management certification standard for airports (ACI, 2021). It is not obligatory to have the certificate, but, as recent studies have indicated (Efthymiou and Papatheodorou, 2018; Falk and Hagsten, 2020), this situation will change when the globally agreed-on Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) takes effect (European Commission, 2020).====The main objective of the study was to assess the significance of factors that determine pro-environmental orientation in airport management, based on the example of Polish airports. Although the current literature provides extensive knowledge on the variety of activities and factors determining the airports’ pursuit of the green airport model, environmental management of airports is rarely addressed from the perspective of environmental management and certification systems in the context of the increasingly rigid climate policy. In particular, there is still a lack of theoretical and empirical research related to green airport management in Poland. This study aims to fill this gap. The need to research Polish airports is justified by the fact that their pro-environmental measures are marginal despite a high growth rate of the Polish aviation market (Eurostat, 2019). Most Polish airports have not developed sustainable development strategies and, only to a small extent, have implemented environmental management and certification systems, limiting themselves to the minimum national statutory requirements. None of the 6 Polish airports associated with ACI participates in the ACA ACI certification program. At the same time, Polish airports will have to deal with on increasingly stricter EU environmental policy, in particular concerning CO==== emissions tracking.====The rest of this paper proceeds in five parts: literature overview, research methodology, results, discussion, and conclusions.",Factors determining the implementation of green practices in airport management.

The problem is characterized by uncertainty in the duration of the disruption and the point in time when its length becomes known. Both a single-commodity network model and multi-commodity network model with side constraints are developed to first determine the flights that are most likely to be affected, and then to adjust their schedules to achieve system-wide optimality. The overall objective is to minimize the weighted sum of total passenger delay costs, cancellation costs, curfew violation costs, and variation from the original schedule. The two types of uncertainty are addressed by examining a range of scenarios that reflect the most likely outcomes. The results provide guidance and a measure of robustness for the flight director as the disruption unfolds. A rolling horizon approach that closely mimics current procedures used by several airlines is also presented to provide a benchmark for comparisons with the two-stage solutions.","Airlines have done extensive research to optimize their operational schedules, crew assignments and gate assignments. However, unexpected disruptions such as severe weather, equipment failure, air-traffic-control restrictions, and crew shortages can disturb the published schedule and result in flight delays, cancellations or aircraft swaps. Each of these actions have consequences that affect passenger itineraries, crew schedules and flight connections that are costly to address. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the total delay before COVID-19 in the U.S. during 2019 costs airlines approximately 4% of their revenues, adding up to around $33 billion (FAA, 2020). In addition, unsatisfied customers may realign their loyalty with competitors if the disruption is not handled in a timely manner or they are not adequately compensated. A single delay at an airport could possibly cause a chain reaction that affects operations in the connecting airports that eventually affects thousands of passengers and dozens of crew members. Therefore, having the ability to react to different disruptions quickly is essential for airlines to stay competitive while keeping costs low. The problem includes aircraft recovery, gate reassignment, crew reassignment and passenger recovery. In this paper, the aircraft recovery problem is studied specifically with the goal of getting aircraft from a single fleet back on their regular schedule as soon as possible under restrictions such as arrival and departure curfews, maximum allowed delays, and adherence to station assignments.====To restore the original schedule, the most common options for operations personnel are flight delays and cancellations (Arguello et al. 1997, Jarrah et al. 1993, Teodorović and Guberinić 1984). In extreme situations, ferried aircraft can be dispatched to the airport where the equipment is needed. However, this is a rarely used option due to its expense and the fact that there are few if any spare aircraft. Airlines are also very reluctant to cancel a flight unless the delay exceeds a reasonable amount of time, or no other cost-efficient alternative is available. Upon cancellation, extra costs including meal vouchers and hotel accommodations are incurred. Apart from cost, another factor that needs to be considered is aircraft swaps. In the updated schedule after a disruption, if an aircraft is assigned flights that were originally assigned to other aircraft, then a swap has occurred. Extensive swaps often result in a completely different schedule compared to the original one, and regardless of the potential savings, airlines prefer to have the majority of aircraft to adhere to their original schedule with as few changes as possible to avoid crew reassignments, gate reassignments, passenger confusion, and maintenance disruptions. In 2019, 2.21% of U.S. domestic flights were canceled and only about 0.29% were diverted to an airport other than their original destination (BTS, 2020). Implicitly, there is a tradeoff between lower costs and fewer modifications. To deal with this issue, we provide aircraft with a “reward” in our model for staying on their original route while also limiting the number of routes that can be changed over the day.====The vast majority of past research on irregular operations and disruption management in the airline industry has relied on deterministic models in which the identification of impacted resources and the duration of their reduced availability are given (e.g., see Bard et al. 2001, Cao and Kanafani 1997a, Yan and Lin 1997). Such examples might be aircraft A1 will be unavailable for 2 h from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm, Flight 101 will be delayed for 1 h from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm, Airport DFW is closed for 3 h with no departing aircraft. Given these inputs, the optimization model generates a new schedule within the recovery period for all aircraft to reduce the impact of the disruption on the planned operational schedule, the booked passengers, the assigned aircraft maintenance schedules and the associated costs, assuming that other resources like crew and gates are sufficiently flexible to accommodate the flight changes. Solutions require that the correct number of aircraft be available at each station in the network at the end of recovery period to ensure that operations are back on track the next day.====In reality, however, the duration and intensity of disruptions are uncertain, and only estimates are given to decision makers. Using a deterministic model with estimates that are even modestly unreliable can lead to poor solutions. When the length of the disruption is overestimated, the airline might make unnecessary changes; alternatively, it could fail to be ready for future operations when the disruption is longer and worse than expected. Therefore, what decision makers really need are robust solutions that limit operational changes and provide an ability to react quickly as more information about the disruption becomes known. A robust plan should lay out the rescheduling options for a range of likely contingencies. The “best” new schedule should be feasible but limited in the number of delays and cancellations it imposes to allow for adjustments as the operational day unfolds. Because disruption estimates are often guesses, it is unwise to commit to a single plan until solid information is obtained. It is better to wait as long as possible before making changes to the schedule, but not to the point were the recovery options are so limited that the solution leads to results that are worse than if a decision had been made earlier. The challenge, of course, is to determine the time at which to commit and the action to take.====The way we propose to address the recovery problem is to develop different plans as a function of the potential length of a disruption. The plans or solutions are derived from likely scenarios, where a scenario is a given disruption with known duration. As more information becomes available, or as the current information becomes more reliable, solutions become more accurate giving the decision maker more confidence in the recommended course of action. In many cases, we found that the recovery plans were similar or identical for different disruption durations. In those cases, we are able to identify a subset of flights to be canceled, delayed or swapped with high confidence that such action is optimal. In other cases, we found that the best strategies may be markedly different depending on the number of aircraft disrupted, the particular airport where the disruption takes place, or the certainty of the current information.====To find solutions for each scenario, we developed a two-step algorithm to update the schedule at a fixed point in time during the disruption. The rationale for the algorithm is the intractability of the full model, especially with instances that may contain scores of aircraft and hundreds of flight legs. In the first step, a time- space, single commodity network model with side constraints is solved to narrow down an instance to a manageable number of aircraft and flights. In the next step, the first step solution is used to create a reduced multi-commodity network that returns the recovery schedule. This constitutes stage 1 of our methodology. In stage 2, we repeatedly use the two-step algorithm to solve the recovery problem at increasing time points, up to the maximum allowable delay for the given disruption. The problem at each time point is a scenario. As mentioned, the solutions across similar scenarios provide insights into which flights to delay or cancel with a high degree of confidence before taking action. As an alternative, a rolling horizon approach is also developed to update flight schedules periodically over the length of the disruption. The procedure closely aligns with current practice and can be used to evaluate the solutions obtained with the two-stage algorithm. Note that in the data set used in our computational experiments, each flight leg has a unique alphanumeric identifier so we do not distinguish between “flights” and “flight legs” in the sequel.====With this background in mind, the purpose of this paper is to provide a methodology for recovering aircraft schedules over the day with the objective of minimizing a weighted sum of total passenger delay costs, cancellation costs, curfew violation costs, and variation from the original schedule in the face of equipment disruptions and information uncertainty. The research offers the following contributions:====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines related work.

Despite its significance, the existing airport ranking approaches by various aviation organizations and agencies does not provide a comprehensive methodology to rank the airports based on multiple criteria. This paper proposes a comprehensive multi-stage multi-criteria ==== approach that combines ====, best-worst method, and multi-attributive ==== approximation area comparison method to provide a robust ranking framework. The ranking procedure is based on seven criteria, i.e. passenger throughput, number of direct routes, number of check-in counters, terminal area, number of gates, number of flights, and number of runways. The proposed method ranks the shortlisted airports from the best to the worst and evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of each of the candidate airports. A real-world example involving the ranking of the efficient major commercial service airports in China is demonstrated to validate the applicability of the proposed approach. The insights generated have implications for the benchmarking of airports.","As the privatization of airports, the emergence of low-cost carriers, and growing tourist demand have become increasingly evident across the global air transport sector (Graham, 2013; IATA, 2018; Paraschi et al., 2019), the airport stakeholders and civil aviation policymakers are now more determined to perform the continuous performance evaluation of the airports to ensure growth and sustainability in the global market (Kumar and Gupta, 2020; Merkert and Mangia, 2014; Paraschi et al., 2019; Scotti et al., 2014). An effective airport performance assessment system ultimately helps the air carriers in identifying the efficient airports for air service operations, guides policymaking in determining the allocation of the scarce resources for airport construction or improvement, aids the airport managers in benchmarking of the airports, and drive the development of domestic and inbound tourism (IATA, 2018; Kumar and Gupta, 2020; Paraschi et al., 2019; Shojaei et al., 2018).====International organizations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Airports Council International (ACI), and industry bodies, like Skytrax, routinely publish data related to airport performance and ranking. Although these rankings provide a good benchmarking platform to identify the best performing and the underperforming airports, they are mainly based on the output criteria (such as passenger throughput and number of flights) of the airports (Pathomsiri et al., 2008). The adoption of a robust approach to rank the airports while investigating the relationship between the input criteria (such as number of direct routes, number of check-in counters, and terminal area) and output criteria is critical for effective airport operations and air traffic management. The literature on efficiency and productivity measurement of airports for their efficient management is replete (Fernandes and Pacheco, 2018; Paraschi et al., 2019; Rezaei et al., 2018; Sarkis, 2000; Yang, 2010). Moreover, studies related to the ranking of the competing airports have gathered much more research attention in recent years (Chakraborty et al., 2020b; Cheung et al., 2020; Shojaei et al., 2018).====Motivated by the attention paid to airport ranking by IATA, ACI, and Skytrax, this paper therefore seeks to answer the following research questions.====In order to address the above research questions along with a goal of proposing a robust airport ranking technique, this paper presents a multi-stage approach while effectively integrating three techniques, i.e., data envelopment analysis (DEA), best-worst method (BWM), and the multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method. The motivation concerning the application of only the above-mentioned techniques and not others is that they are most recently developed, superior and robust in handling multi-criteria decision-making problems. The respective references pertain to the their robustness over the other existing multi-criteria decision-making techniques: DEA (An et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Soheilirad et al., 2018), BWM (Koppiahraj et al., 2021; Safarzadeh et al., 2018; Vafadarnikjoo et al., 2020), and MABAC (Liu et al., 2019; Pamucar et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2020). The objective is to comprehensively rank the targeted commercial service airports based on their relative performance with respect to a pool of evaluation criteria. Fig. 1 presents the airport ranking approach which follows the recent trends in the transportation literature (Cheung et al., 2020; Shojaei et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019) in the domain of the multi-criteria data analytics approach (Rezaei et al., 2018; Sarkis and Talluri, 2004; Shojaei et al., 2018). In the first stage of this approach, the targeted airports are classified into efficient and inefficient airports based on the relationship between a set of input and output criteria. An efficient airport will specifically maximize its output criteria with limited inputs. The relative importance (weights) of the criteria under consideration are determined using BWM in the next stage. The last stage deals with the application of the MABAC method to rank the efficient airports along with identifying their relative strengths and weaknesses. Thus, this paper introduces and incorporates the application of multi-stage multi-criteria decision-making techniques into the transportation infrastructure benchmarking research while considering an actual case of ranking the targeted commercial service airports in China to validate the applicability of the proposed approach. Additionally, the rankings of the airports derived using the proposed method and those obtained based on a single criterion are contrasted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adopted approach. Furthermore, to validate its robustness, a sensitivity analysis study is performed.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Accordingly, social responsibility issues arising from business operations have received widespread attention. To enhance stakeholder trust and improve customer loyalty, business organizations have increasingly paid attention to the assessment of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the formulation of CSR reports (Vaio et al., 2022; Wong et al., 2022). However, as the content of CSR is dynamic and is continuously evolving with economic and technological development (Hofman et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2022), CSR strategies must be context-specific to succeed (Rupley et al., 2017). Therefore, from a business perspective, the challenge is not about how to define CSR but rather, to understand how CSR is socially constructed in a specific context and how to take this into account when implementing business strategies, especially for global companies (Marrewijk, 2003).====Thanks to China's unprecedented development over the past few decades, it has become the world's largest consumer market and the world's leading exporter (Ma and Bu, 2021). Therefore, exploring the logic and components of CSR implementation in China's context can help clarify how Chinese companies implement their social strategies to promote sustainable development and provide a reference for international enterprises to understand the strategic implementation direction of CSR in China. In fact, studies have shown that China's unique cultural background and political environment impact Chinese CSR discourse and practice (Hofman et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2018), and calls have been made for academia and practitioners to understand how CSR is socially constructed in the Chinese context (Hofman et al., 2017). This is especially important for the airline industry, as airline development heavily relies on international development (Cowper-Smith and Grosbois, 2011).====The airline industry has an irreplaceable role in promoting global economic, social, and cultural development; creating jobs; serving public travel; and sharing knowledge and experiences (Yang et al., 2020). Nonetheless, the airline industry also has negative impacts on the natural environment, such as noise pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, and gaseous emissions (Cowper-Smith and Grosbois, 2011). Notably, because the greenhouse gases produced by aircrafts are directly released into the upper atmosphere, the airline industry has a greater impact on climate change than other industries (Cowper-Smith and Grosbois, 2011; Yang et al., 2020). Given its growth and significant impact, the airline industry is thus under increasing pressure to take measures to reduce or mitigate its negative impact while maintaining or increasing its positive impact. Consequently, the interest in and commitment to the idea of CSR is growing among airlines (Chen et al., 2012; Cowper-Smith and Grosbois, 2011).====Drawing on theories such as the three concentric circles (Committee for Economic Development, 1971), pyramid model of CSR (Carroll, 1991), and triple bottom line (Elkington and Rowlands, 1997), scholars have made meaningful explorations on the content of CSR. However, limited attention has been paid to the content of CSR in the airline sector (Wut et al., 2022). In the airline sector, the triple bottom line model—comprising environmental, economic, and social dimensions—is the dominant theoretical model used by researchers and corporates to assess CSR and form CSR reports (e.g. Cowper-Smith and Grosbois, 2011; Mak and Chan, 2007). Notably, these theories are mostly set in Western countries, especially European countries and the United States, and function within a “Western” framework (Hofman et al., 2017; Okumus et al., 2020). Practically, the formulation of CSR reports in the airline industry is often based on guidelines set by Western countries that are applicable to all industries, such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4, GRI G3.1, ISO 26000, and SA 8000. As such, there remains a dearth of knowledge on airline CSR in China, and the features of CSR in China's airline industry are largely unknown, not to mention how they have evolved over time.====To address these gaps in the literature, this study investigates the nature and evolutionary characteristics of CSR in China's airline sector, highlighting the influence of the Chinese context. Through content analysis of CSR reports (2007–2020) issued by different types of Chinese airline companies, this study examines two questions.====The study contributes to airline CSR literature by probing into CSR in the airline sector in a non-Western setting (i.e., China), but more importantly, it offers a contextualized and dynamic understanding of Chinese airline CSR.",Corporate social responsibility in China's airline industry: A longitudinal content analysis of related reports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000637,16 May 2023,2023,Research Article,6.0

To better understand charter flight tourism in Asia, this study analyses key reasons affected Taiwan’s charter flight demand from Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore during the period 2009‒2018, with a consideration of aviation- and tourism-related variables. Empirical results show that the reduction in scheduled flight aircraft size stimulated new charter flight demand to Taiwan, offsetting the negative effects caused by scheduled seat increment to a certain degree. This study contributes to literature by exploring the impact of scheduled flight service availability on charter flight demand, and further enriches our understanding of the impact of scheduled flight services on international tourist arrivals in terms of aircraft size. Importantly, it has implications for policymakers and stakeholders involved in charter business, assisting them in facilitating aviation and tourism recovery during the post-COVID-19 era.","According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO),==== the demand for international passenger charter services showed robust growth during the period of 1960s–1990s, peaking in 2001 with 272,790 million revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) and then declined constantly for years. The increase in scheduled services provided by both low-cost carriers (LCC) and full-service airlines (FSA) is the primary reason causing the decline in charter traffic (Williams, 2001; Wu et al., 2018). However, the demand for charter services reached 214,706 million RPKs in 2018, an increase of 8.6% compared with the demand in 2009. This raises an interesting question regarding the reasons for constantly increasing air charter demand over the past decade, despite increased scheduled service availability.====It seems that tourism variables are potential reasons for stability in charter demand. On the one side, aviation authorities always prioritise scheduled services, such as not allowing airlines flying charter flights to routes that are served by scheduled flights, and even asking airlines to suspend their charter operations once scheduled flights are launched. On the other side, charter flights are traditionally marketed to the public by travel agencies (also referred to as tour operators) in combination with other services such as hotel packages and/or in combination with specific fare conditions (ICAO, 2022). Tour operators assume the commercial risk and responsibility of charter operations; while airlines offer charter flight services just to fulfil the requirements of tour operators, such as through contractual arrangements between airlines and tour operators (ICAO, 2009). In the Asian market, for example, tour operators could develop new charter routes after regular flights were launched, thus offsetting the decline to a certain degree (Wu, 2016).====Air transport and tourism are mutually dependent industries (Papatheodorou, 2021). There has been increased research interest in exploring the influence of aviation activities on international tourism development, whereas few studies investigated the influence of tourism activities on air transport attributes (Spasojevic et al., 2019). As direct (non-stop) air service availability affects the accessibility of long-haul or overseas destinations, researchers have explored the effect of changes in non-stop routes (Duval and Schiff, 2011; Tveteras and Roll, 2014) or airlines' business model (Alderighi and Gaggero, 2019; Vieira et al., 2019) on international tourist arrivals. Whilst passengers carried by charter flights are typical holiday tourists and charter services presented more than 4% of worlds's total international revenue passenger traffic such as in 2019, it is unusual to quantify the effects of changes in aircraft size served scheduled flights directly. Yet, as far as the authors' knowledge, there is no study that has directly estimated the impact of the availability of scheduled flights on the demand for charter services.====With the above in mind, this study has two purposes: (i) to explore the effects of direct scheduled flight service availability on international charter demand; and (ii) to highlight the influence of tourism industry on air transport attributes in terms of charter services. Particularly, it classifies scheduled flight service availability into two variables: (i) aircraft size of scheduled flights; and (ii) available seats provided by scheduled flights. In order to better understand the influence of the tourism industry on air transport attributes, the study also estimates the effects of variables related to charter tour prices and tourists’ income levels. Using the panel Tobit model, we estimate the effects of selected variables on charter demand from Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore to Taiwan during the period of 2009–2018, aiming to investigate key factors that supported charter business over the last decade.====This study contributes to research on charter services by exploring the impact of scheduled flight service availability. The empirical findings enrich our understanding of charter services in the Asian market over the last decade and the effect of tourism variables on the attributes of air transport. It also contributes to current debates on the effects of direct scheduled service availability on tourist arrivals to island destinations. In addition to the available flight seats provided, this study also uses aircraft size as the indicator of scheduled flight service availability. Importantly, it is the first study in the limited empirical literature regarding the effects of changes in aircraft size on charter demand. Additionally, international charter services will play a unique role in the post-COVID-19 era, due to the widespread regular flight cancellations and charter air transportation may realise “seamless transfer” for bigger groups (Wu et al., 2022).

There are more than 5,000 public-use airports in the U.S. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s 2020 Economic Impact Report, the U.S. public airport system supported nearly 950 million passengers with 1, 377 billion revenue passenger miles and reported 67 billion revenue ton-miles in 2016. In 2016, the U.S. civil aviation sector contributed $1.8 trillion in total economic activity (5% of national GDP) and supported nearly 11 million jobs (FAA, 2020).====In the U.S., there are different models of governance for public airports (Gillen, 2011). Since the advent of commercial airline service in the 1920s, public airports have largely been owned and operated by local governments (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2009; Gillen, 2011). Typically, a city or county government establishes a division or department of aviation to administer all aspects of airports. The directors of local aviation departments report directly to the leaders of city or county governments (e.g., city mayors, city managers, county mayors, and county commissioners). In general, the airports' annual budgets, capital improvement planning, bond sales, and leadership appointments are subject to approval from the city or county councils. Examples of airports owned and operated by local governments are the O'Hare International Airport (the City of Chicago, Illinois) and the Miami International Airport (the Miami-Dade County, Florida). As an alternative to direct control by local governments, airport authorities were first created to take control over public airports during the 1950s and 1960s (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2009). In general, airport authorities are formed by state legislations, municipal or county actions, or sometimes by joint agreements across jurisdictions. An airport authority is a quasi-governmental entity responsible for the operation and management of airports (Oliver Wyman, 2013). It often has a more autonomous governance structure with its own functional departments, such as finance and procurement departments. While airport authorities are structured as independent and self-supporting institutions, the board members of an airport authority are usually appointed by local governments (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2009; Oliver Wyman, 2013). For example, the Wayne County Airport Authority was established in 2002 under the State of Michigan Senate Bill 690. It is responsible for the management and operation of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW). This Authority is managed by an independent, seven-member Board of Directors. Four members are appointed by the Wayne County Executive, one member is appointed by the Wayne County Commission, and two members are appointed by the Governor.====In recent years, there have been several attempts by states to change the governance structure at major airports run by city governments. When airport governance changes are forced on a city by its state, it is called a state takeover of the airport (Mohr and Mushipe, 2019). Three of these city-managed airports are the Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) in the state of North Carolina (2013), the Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport (JAN) in the state of Mississippi (2016), and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) in the state of Georgia (2019). The argument for a change of governance structure for these large and important assets is likely to be at least as political as it is based upon economic and financial reasons (Mohr and Mushipe, 2019). Despite a large volume of empirical studies on the effects of governance structures on airport efficiency performance, to date, little research has been conducted on the change of airport governance structure. To fill this research gap, this research analyzes and compares three recent state airport takeover attempts based on a qualitative case study approach. To the best of our knowledge, the study makes three important contributions to the literature on airport governance. First, it discovers what motivating factors are important to the discussion of state airport takeover attempts. Second, it identifies the main issues and challenges of transitioning to a new governance structure in each case. Third, it provides policy implications for future airport governance reforms, which is an area that is severely underdeveloped and in need of scholarship.====The structure of this paper is as follows. In the second section, we synthesize relevant literature on airport governance. The third section introduces the research methodology.

However, there is a lack of effective and precise approach of dealing with this problem. This study proposes a hybrid approach of combining association rule mining (ARM) method and system dynamics (SD) model to predict and warn pilots' unsafe behaviors. Firstly, the risk factors are identified and classified according to the historical incident data by the human factor analysis and classification system. Then, the association rules between risk factors and unsafe behaviors are obtained by ARM. Finally, the SD is adopted to construct the risk prediction and early warning model for pilots' unsafe behaviors, and the applicability and effectiveness of the model are verified by the actual data from 2016 to 2020. The results of ARM show that there are 48 risk factors affecting pilots' unsafe behaviors, and 142 key association rules are formed between these risk factors and unsafe behaviors; environmental influences, pilots' adverse states, and organizational influences are all strongly related to pilots' unsafe behaviors, and the impact of environmental influences on unsafe behaviors mainly rely on the interaction with other factors. The results of SD demonstrate that although both of the cognitive error risk and the decision error risk show an increasing trend, the former increases slowly and keeps at the level of no alarm while the latter is growing faster and its risk may increase from no alarm to critical alarm; the operation error risk and the violation risk both show a downward trend, and finally remain at the no alarm level; the risk of pilots' unsafe behaviors has a stable fluctuation trend, and the risk values of most time are in the threshold ranges of major warning and critical warning. This work provides theoretical guidance for the decision-makers to develop measures to reduce incidents caused by pilots’ unsafe behaviors.","Aviation safety, being the lifeline of civil aviation enterprises and even the entire aviation industry of a country (Li et al., 2021), has been improved a lot with many resources invested (Chen et al., 2017). However, as global aviation activity continues to increase, accident rates may still be on the rise (Hsu et al., 2010; Song, 2017). Human error is the main factor leading to flight accidents. According to statistics, more than 70% of flight accidents are related to pilots' human error (Guo et al., 2017; Chen and Yu, 2018). Pilots are directly responsible for flight safety. During a flight, any unsafe behaviors of the pilot may lead to unsafe incidents. These unsafe behaviors can be classified into cognitive errors, operation errors, decision errors, and violations (Shappell and Wiegmann, 2003; Scarborough et al., 2005). Compared to equipment and technical factors, human unsafe behaviors are subjective and sudden, and are difficult to be completely controlled. Therefore, predicting pilots’ unsafe behaviors becomes crucial for preventing flight incidents.====Many scholars have carried out research on pilots' unsafe behaviors from the aspects of risk factor analysis and intervention strategies. For risk factor analysis, the effects of organizational influence, unsafe supervision, and pilot status on unsafe behaviors of pilots are explored by the approach of human factor analysis and classification system (HFACS) (Song, 2017; Donmez and Uslu, 2020; Guo et al., 2017; Bendak and Rashid, 2020; Pinsky et al., 2020; Mohammadfam et al., 2021; Sant’ Anna and Hilal, 2021). For intervention strategies study, scholars mainly used qualitative and quantitative methods to conduct post intervention to explore the impact of different intervention strategies on different types of unsafe behaviors of pilots (Chen et al., 2017; Chen and Yu., 2018). Only a few scholars have carried out research on early warning of unsafe behaviors from the perspective of prevention with quantitative methods (Harris and Li., 2019). However, the existing research lacks the exploration of the relationship between factors, and the research on unsafe behavior risk prediction and early warning still needs to be improved. In recent years, a few scholars have explored the risk prediction and warning of air traffic controllers' unsafe acts (Xu and Luo, 2021) using association rule mining and random forest, which lays the foundation for the development of this research. However, their study didn't subdivide human errors and risk factors, and the prediction accuracy still needs to be improved.====A great number of studies are devoted to construct risk prediction and early warning model, aiming to prevent the occurrence of unsafe incidents caused by unsafe behaviors. Thus, many prediction and early warning methods are developed, such as neural network (Ding et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022), logistic regression model (Zhai et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021), decision tree (Sharma et al., 2021), fault tree (Ikwan et al., 2021), Bayesian network model (Mohammadfam et al., 2017; Valdés et al., 2018; Zhang and Mahadevan, 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Asadayoobi et al., 2022), etc. Some of these methods have been used to predict unsafe behaviors, for example, neural network has been used to predict the safety work behaviors of construction workers (Patel and Jha, 2016; Ding et al., 2018), unsafe acts of the air force (Harris and Li, 2019), and Bayesian network has been used to predict the safety behavior of employees at workplace (Mohammadfam et al., 2017). Although the above prediction methods have advantages in their respective applicable fields, these methods do not consider the impact of the relationship between risk factors and unsafe behaviors.====Deeply understanding of the relationship between risk factors and pilots' unsafe behaviors is indicated to be crucial in developing effective control measures for unsafe behaviors. Association rule mining (ARM) (Agrawal et al., 1993) has the advantages of high mining efficiency and easy operation. It has been used to mine the association rules between safety risk monitoring types and the coupling of risks in subway engineering (Zhou et al., 2019), predict traffic congestion (Wen et al., 2019) and air traffic controllers' unsafe acts (Xu and Luo, 2021). However, ARM can only obtain the association rules between risk factors, but cannot predict the unsafe behaviors of pilots. System dynamics (SD) can effectively predict the changing trend of the system, and fully reflect the causal relationship and correlation between factors. Moreover, compared with neutral network, SD has the advantages of low computation load and accounting for the non-linear interactions and feedback in complex systems. It is widely used in system safety analysis (Shire et al., 2018), fire prediction (Wang et al., 2019), investment prediction (Meng et al., 2022), simulation of risk control strategies for air traffic controllers’ unsafe acts (Xu and Luo, 2022). However, few work has been done on using SD to predict unsafe behaviors.====The studies on risk prediction and warning of pilots' unsafe behaviors still need to be improved and deepened. Firstly, current research mainly focuses on single risk analysis without consideration of association rules between risk factors and pilots' unsafe behaviors. Secondly, the existing studies mainly focus on ex-post strategy simulation analysis, and pay less attention to ex-ante prevention. Less study is devoted to the construction of the risk prediction and early warning model of pilots' unsafe behaviors. Thirdly, existing research mainly focuses on pilots' errors and violations, and does not subdivide errors. In view of these, this study aims to obtain the strong association rules between risk factors affecting pilots' unsafe behaviors using ARM. With the construction of a causal diagram of pilots' unsafe behaviors, including cognitive errors, operation errors, decision errors, and violations based on strong association rules, SD is applied to construct risk prediction and early warning model. The model is verified by comparing prediction results with actual values. When the risk value of unsafe behaviors exceeds the threshold, the warning information will be sent out, which provides theoretical guidance for making measures to reduce the incidents caused by pilots’ unsafe behaviors.",Risk prediction and early warning of pilots’ unsafe behaviors using association rule mining and system dynamics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000650,9 May 2023,2023,Research Article,9.0

After screening 1117 contributions, 45 contributions were considered in the analysis of the methodological implementation. Based on this analysis, challenges and further research requirements were identified. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for conducting LCA in the aviation industry.","The influence of the aviation industry on climate change and other impacts of aviation on the environment are increasingly becoming relevant in public debates (Barke et al., 2020; Gössling et al., 2019; Rice et al., 2020; Ryley et al., 2020). Between 2016 and 2018, the share of CO==== emissions from aviation relative to the global CO==== emissions was 2.8% (Federal Association of the German Air Transport Industry e. V. (BDL), 2019; Gössling et al., 2021). Other effects, such as contrails or soot pollution, further contribute to anthropogenic global warming (Lee et al., 2021). Further environmental impacts also occur along the entire life cycle of commercial aircraft. For example, emisions during production are emitted as well as during repair processes of components (Al-Lami et al., 2018; Rolinck et al., 2021). In addition, an infrastructure consisting of airports is required for operation, which again leads to environmental impacts (Hubbard and Hubbard, 2019; Ramakrishnan et al., 2022; Sreenath et al., 2021). Efficiency improvements in all areas of the aviation industry are counteracting the environmental impacts, but up to now have only had a limited effect due to the steady growth of the industry (Lee et al., 2021). Despite the temporary relief provided by the Corona pandemic, the severity of the issue has not changed, and the German Air Transport Association predicts a return to pre-pandemic emission levels as early as 2025 (Federal Association of the German Air Transport Industry e. V. (BDL), 2021). Additionally, despite the further expected growth of the aviation industry, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has formulated a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in 2021. In doing so, the aviation industry aims to support the 1.5 °C target agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement (IATA IATA, 2021).====Aircraft manufacturers and all other stakeholders in the aviation industry are meeting these targets with technical innovations along the entire product life cycle. To this end, new technologies are developed or existing technical systems are further optimized with the aim of reducing environmental impacts (Arnaldo Valdés et al., 2019). To structure current research areas focused on sustainability, the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) proposes a framework with 6 areas, as shown in Fig. 1 (Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), 2020). The first research area defined within the framework is the area of ====, which is prioritized in particular by aircraft manufacturers as well as their suppliers in the industry. This area involves both improving existing aircraft designs and developing completely new aircraft design and propulsion concepts (Ma et al., 2022; Marciello et al., 2022; Nicolay et al., 2021; Sziroczak et al., 2020). In addition, new materials, such as fiber composites, are being developed to reduce aircraft weight (Bachmann et al., 2017). A second branch of research considers ====. Within this area, optimizations in routing and flight planning are particularly focused on (Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), 2020; Ho-Huu et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2015; Zhang and Mahadevan, 2017). In addition, ways to reduce noise emissions are being investigated (Li et al., 2013; K Zhao et al., 2020). ==== represents the third pillar of the framework. Here, potentials regarding environmental impacts during ground time are examined (Altuntas et al., 2014). Areas of research include electrified propulsion during taxiing operations. The fourth research focus focuses on ==== and manufacturing in the aviation industry. Due to the complex product structure and the high technical components requirements, the production complexity in the aviation industry is very high (Formentini et al., 2021). Reduction of production complexity could, among other benefits, result in potentials for reduced energy consumption during production. Furthermore, current research in mechanical manufacturing, studies the optimization of the ratio of the material quantity from the start of processing to finished component, the so-called „buy-to-flight ratio“ (Bachmann et al., 2017). Furthermore, completely new manufacturing processes such as additive manufacturing are being investigated with regard to their environmental impact. Research area five focuses on the operating phase with the aim of establishing ====. This involves analyzing the maintenance, repair and retrofitting of aircraft and researching new methods for reducing energy and resource consumption within these sub-processes. Furthermore, research on aircraft handling after decommissioning is gaining attention (Keivanpour et al., 2015; Sabaghi et al., 2016; X Zhao et al., 2020). The aim is to increase recycling rates and even to develop closed material flows (Markatos and Pantelakis, 2022). The final research area is ====. Its objective is to replace kerosene, which is currently the conventional fossil fuel for aircraft. At the core of the research activities are Sustainable-Aviation-Fuels (SAF) (Bullerdiek et al., 2021; Kroyan et al., 2022).====In order to allocate research activities and achieve the goals defined by the industry, firstly a transparent, quantitative analysis of current environmental impacts and secondly an evaluation of optimizations and new technologies are necessary (Melo et al., 2020). For this purpose, different methods for the evaluation of environmental impacts are used in research and practice. A widely used method is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), whose origins can be found in the 1960s (Björn et al., 2018). With the help of Life Cycle Assessment it is possible to evaluate processes, products and services with respect to their environmental impacts over the entire life cycle and thus to identify optimization potentials or to compare different technologies (ISO-14040, 2006; Lee and Inaba, 2004). Both research and practice consequently require performing life cycle analyses. However, for the methodologically correct implementation, the specifics of the aviation industry need to be considered. Based on this challenge, this paper analyzes the status of the application of LCA in the aviation industry. This paper will specifically not focus on the area of new fuel development, as Melo et al. have already addressed this area in a systematic literature review (Melo et al., 2020). Rather, this paper focuses on the other research areas mentioned above and, in particular, examines the methodological implementation of the individual life cycle assessments. The goal is to use the analysis to provide a guide to LCA for researchers and practitioners in the aviation industry, thereby further enhancing the quality and comparability of future environmental impact studies. This review paper thus answers the following two research questions (RQ):====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers the basics of LCA and differentiates its features from other methods. In addition, the typical aircraft life cycle including fuel and airport life cycle is presented. The section ends with an overview of identified literature review in this research area. Section 3 presents the methodology used to conduct the systematic literature review. Section 4 presents the results of the systematic literature review. For this purpose, this paper first presents the quantitative results and subsequently discusses the considered papers regarding the application focus and the methodological implementation. Based on the results, Section 5 presents further research needs and introduces a first framework for the application of LCA in the aviation industry. This paper concludes with a summary in Section 6.","Life cycle assessment in aviation: A systematic literature review of applications, methodological approaches and challenges",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000613,6 May 2023,2023,Research Article,10.0

These three approaches correspond to different market structures. The latest strategy has a co-opetition relationship between airlines: traditional airlines operating older aircraft purchase emission allowances from airlines operating newer aircraft. The purpose of this paper is to examine the conditions for airlines' paying penalties, purchasing allowances from the ETS market, or cooperation. We demonstrate that the EU ETS will always be detrimental to airlines using older aircraft. A hefty premium may effectively induce airlines to pursue a low-carbon transition plan. Our study shows that the ETS is not a silver bullet; it only works when the premium mechanism is designed properly and a fair market for emission allowances is available.","Aviation's greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reached a record high before air travel was abruptly halted owing to COVID-19 (Gössling, 2020). Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, worldwide aviation traffic levels are expected to return to 2019 levels by 2024 and return to profitability for the global airline industry in 2023 (IATA, 2022a, IATA, 2022b). Global warming has been a challenge in the last decade, and high carbon emission is the primary reason the low-carbon transition has received attention. Considerable research is being conducted on monitoring and controlling carbon emissions (Hansen et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2021; Huisingh et al., 2015; Nordhaus, 2020). Although aviation is not included in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change which targets to limit global temperature rise to 2 °C, the aviation industry is responsible for 3% of global emissions (Baroutaji et al., 2019; Scheelhaase and Grimme, 2007). By 2050, emissions from international aviation that impact the global climate and local air quality are projected to grow by a factor of two to four times the 2015 levels (Fleming and Lépinay, 2019).====The aviation sector's contribution to climate change is an example of long-term negative externalities that are frequently overlooked when evaluating aviation's economic performance and social responsibility, despite the fact that aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to achieve GHG reductions (Schäfer and Waitz, 2014; Bows-Larkin et al., 2016; Andrés and Padilla, 2018). Following road transport, aircraft contribute around 3.7%–4% of total CO==== emissions in the EU and are the second-largest source of transportation emissions (Andreoni and Galmarini, 2012; Liselotte, 2022). Specifically, according to European Union data, aviation emissions account for 13.9% of total transportation emissions (European Commission 2021a). As a result, the EU establishes stringent and ambitious emission reduction targets in place to accelerate low-carbon transformation. Airlines that do not adhere to the criteria must face a fine for their environmental blundering.====Aviation is one of the fastest-rising sources of GHG (McCollum et al., 2010; Birchfield, 2015; Hu et al., 2022; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2022). The EU is one of the largest aviation emitters in the world, and it is anticipated that intra-EU flights will increase by over 80% compared to 2005 levels by 2030. Without intervention, emissions could increase by much to 300% by 2050 (ICAO, 2022). To address this issue, the European Commission (EC) announced a series of measures aimed at achieving climate neutrality to 1990 levels in the EU by 2050, including an intermediate goal of at least a 55% net reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 (‘Fit for 55′) (European Commission, 2021b; Liselotte, 2022).====To accelerate carbon reduction, the total amount of EU Emission Allowances (EUAs) drops at a pace of 2.2% annually beginning in 2021, up from 1.74% previously (European Commission, 2022). The carbon price is designed to gradually accelerate decarbonization. Allowances are required for each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO====eq) emitted by firms. EUAs are obtained through purchases, auctions, or are provided for free. Free EUAs were to be allocated in a way that provided an incentive for decarbonization, through the benchmarks of free allocation derived from the top performers in a given sector (European Commission, 2022a). This should push inefficient businesses to enhance their efficiency while rewarding those that do (ECA, 2020).====In terms of transparency, auctioning is the most efficient way of allocating emission allowances since it puts the principle of polluters paying for pollution into effect (European Commission, 2021a). The EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) is the initiative for developing a reduction plan and carbon offsetting for international aviation, following the EU's 2030 climate target. All airlines operating in Europe, European and non-European alike, obtain tradeable EUAs covering a specified amount of annual emissions from their flights under the EU ETS. Airlines operating in the European Union either buy or get emission permits, which they can trade as required.====Currently, the aviation sector benefits from substantial exemptions from the EU ETS (EUROCONTROL, 2021) and substantial subsidies to regional airports (Wu et al., 2020). More rigorous emissions targets and regulations in the EU are expected to take effect soon, greatly increasing the demand for carbon offsets. Many airlines are unprepared for such a strict carbon trading program (Bruninx et al., 2020), and retiring older airplanes and building a new eco-friendly fleet can be time-consuming and costly. According to European Commission (2021b), the number of free allowances distributed to airlines will be dramatically decreased until they are fully auctioned in 2027. The phasing out of free allowances emphasizes the importance and the fact that more studies addressing this issue are needed.====Only one study has examined the impact of government emissions trading systems (ETSs) on the airline market structure (Barbot et al., 2014). They proposed a theoretical model that analyzes the European ETS's key characteristics as designed for airlines, concentrating on its impact on entrance deterrence and potential competition. Recently, many studies about the causality of ETS change to airlines have been conducted. Kang et al. (2022) conducted an empirical analysis of the causal effect of carbon pricing on aviation supply after the EU ETS. Their study demonstrated that the EU ETS has led to a drop in flight frequency and overall airline seat supply, with the highest percentage of airline seat supply reduction exceeding 20 percent, but has a negligible effect on the average aircraft size.====Previous causality studies of ETS change to the airline using different measurements have inconsistent results. Ex-post analyses of the causal effect of the EU ETS on aviation emissions can be found in studies by Heiaas (2021) and Fageda and Teixidó (2022). To assess the causal relationship of the EU ETS on emissions and flight supply, Fageda and Teixidó (2022) used a difference-in-differences technique on a sample based on all flights within Europe from 2010 to 2016 using data from the EU ETS. They discovered that the EU ETS decreased emissions by 4.7% on regulated routes. The decrease in emissions for low-cost airlines is relatively substantial (11%), but it is not statistically significant for network airlines and short-haul flights (10.7%). By applying a general synthetic control model to simulate a counterfactual scenario, Heiaas (2021) investigated whether the EU ETS was successful in decreasing the aviation sector's emissions from 2012 to 2018. Using jet fuel consumption as a proxy for emissions, their findings revealed that the EU ETS led to an average 10% increase in jet fuel consumption since implementation. However, the report did not establish a causal relationship between EU ETS and jet fuel consumption.====Other ETS studies on airlines include abatement efforts in the airline cost function (Cui et al., 2017; Nava et al., 2018), airline performance (Cui et al., 2016) and network reconfiguration (Albers et al., 2009; Derigs and Illing, 2013). Learned from the lesson that the EU's emissions pooling mechanism allows automobile makers to pool their carbon emissions as a form of cooperation, we study a similar scheme of emissions pooling arrangement for the aviation industry. Although most airlines have a mixed fleet of new and old aircraft, different airlines have different fleet ages. Table 1 shows the average age of the fleet for major EU airlines, fleet ages range from 12.7 years to 4.7 years. Among them, Lufthansa, International Airlines Group and Air France-KLM have the oldest fleets and were Europe's most polluting airlines (Carbon Market Watch, 2021). Airline fleet ages have a positive relationship with carbon emissions (Steven and Merklein, 2013; Xu et al., 2021). To distinguish sustainable airlines from traditional airlines, Kılkış and Kılkış (2017) designed and implemented a composite indicator, Sustainable Airline Index (SAI), to assess various aspects of environmental factors of airline aircraft fleets. They concluded that top performers may provide guidance for more sustainable practices toward carbon-neutral growth in the aviation sector. In practice, many airlines are working hard to become sustainable airlines, for example, Etihad, Starlux and Turkish Airlines (Business Traveller, 2019; Zawya, 2022; Bolat, 2022).====The relationship between fleet ages and carbon dioxide emissions can be taken into consideration as follows. For passenger flights, airlines tend to buy new aircraft because safety and customers' perception are the priority for fleet planning. After decades of service and tens of thousands of landings and takeoffs, mental fatigue in the fuselage, wing, stabilizer and rudder is a major concern. New engine setup for old aircraft is more likely for cargo flights and cargo airlines or a makeshift measure before the delivery of new aircraft. A good example is Amazon buying modified Boeing 767-300s passenger planes into cargo planes. Since sustainable airlines’ aircraft fleet is younger than traditional airlines, the emission is much lower. By pooling emissions with sustainable airlines, traditional airlines can lower carbon emissions and meet the EU ETS standard. This helps the airlines operating old aircraft (====) avoid the premium without shrinking their business scales (hereafter, we will use the terms ==== and ==== interchangeably). This also helps the airlines with new and green aircraft (====) increase income because the traditional airlines have to purchase EUAs from sustainable airlines. The competition might be intensified in the market.====Traditional airlines will use the “Cooperative Strategy” by signing contracts with sustainable airlines. For instance, under an emission cooperative agreement, traditional airlines pay sustainable airlines €79 per ton of CO2eq above the EU ETS quota. (ICAP, 2022). Otherwise, traditional airlines will be required to pay a €100 fine for each ton of carbon they exceed the quota (Bayer and Aklin, 2020). During Phase 1 (2005–2007) of EU ETS, the penalty imposed on the companies for non-compliance was €40 per tonne of CO====eq. The penalty for non-compliance rose to €100 per tonne of CO====eq during Phase 2 (2008–2012) of EU ETS (Bagchi and Velten, 2022; ECA, 2020), as shown in Fig. 1.====Instead, traditional airlines can continue to pay a premium and do nothing, a strategy called the “Pay Premium Strategy.” Fig. 2 presents a clear picture of the EU ETS in the airline industry. In this paper, we develop four scenarios to examine how traditional airlines choose their strategy when faced with stricter ETS regulation. The first is the Benchmark scenario where we investigated the airline's decisions and profit before the implementation of the EU ETS. The second scenario formulates the market structure for the traditional airline's Pay Premium Strategy. The third scenario is the “Market-Based Scenario” where the traditional airline buys allowances (EUAs) from other industries in the EU ETS market at market prices. The fourth scenario is a cooperative market structure in which the traditional airline purchases EUAs from the sustainable airline. Fig. 2 shows the research concept of this paper and the EU ETS in the airline industry.====Due to the sector's expansion, airlines must buy allowances from other EU ETS industries, making the aviation industry the system's net purchaser of allowances (Heiaas, 2021). Since 2005, the average fuel consumption per passenger kilometer (PKP) of airlines has decreased by 24%. This is the result of thirty years of technological advancement in flight operations and aircraft design (Fukui and Miyoshi, 2017). However, the number of passengers transported in Europe has climbed by more than 60% within the same time frame (EASA et al., 2019). Thus, even with technological advancements and “green” innovation, it is unlikely that the emissions associated with the sector's anticipated expansion can be offset (Nava et al., 2018; EASA et al., 2019). Hence, the aviation industry must continue to reduce in-sector emissions at a greater rate (Heiaas, 2021). The industry's emissions have continued to increase, limiting the EU ETS's influence on aviation to balance its own emissions rise through the purchase of allowances from other EU ETS sectors (energy-intensive and electricity industry) (Transport and Environment, 2016). Collectively, this would constitute a non-significant in-sector effect of the ETS system (Transport and Environment, 2016; EASA, 2019).====In addition to the EU's generous cap, the EC permits a one-way trade between aviation and stationary sources in order to facilitate the sector's growth. The aviation industry may acquire EUAs from all parties, but can only sell their permits to other airlines (Kopsch, 2012). The one-way trade under the EU ETS enables airlines to compensate for their emissions by acquiring allowances from sectors where abatement is more easily attainable and cheaper. However, this has weakened the in-sector emission reduction effort (EASA et al., 2019; 2022). Since the introduction of the EU ETS, aviation emissions have climbed by 28% in absolute terms and there is a need for more stringent measures to address environmental externalities. Still, the EU aviation sector is significantly under-charged and under-taxed (Transport & Environment, 2020). Theese reveal the fact that the current platform to allow auction the allowance from other industries is not enough for the airline industry and is not effective in regard to curbing aviation GHG emissions. ETS of other countries also suffers from the inefficient problem. Zhou et al. (2019) examined the degree of efficiency in emission trading markets. Their findings indicated that most ETS are inefficient in China. To address this problem, inspired by EU ETS that allows automobile makers to “pool” their carbon emissions (Sachs and Köster, 2021; European Commission, 2022f), we propose four scenarios to investigate the potential of in-sector GHG emission pooling policy for airlines and compare these scenarios with the current market-based solution in this study.====No ex-post research had directly examined the impact of EU ETS on airline industry competitiveness (Heiaas, 2021). However, Nava et al. (2018) created a microeconomic model to examine the effects of applying EU ETS to the airline industry. They found that the airlines' abatement effort costs and the proportion of free allowances granted are the two most important variables influencing the profit of airlines. Airlines' abatement effort costs have a negative effect and the proportion of free allowances granted has a positive effect on profits. Brueckner and Zhang (2010) argued that the cost of the allowance (the EUA price) is essentially added to the price of fuel. The EUA price may be considered as a carbon tax applied to aviation. Consequently, this policy should have the same impact as an increase in the price of fuel.====The traditional airline does not retire old aircraft in the short run because building new aircraft and fleets takes years. Since the traditional airline purchases EUAs from the sustainable airline, each emission allowance, is identical but with a different cost. Before traditional airlines upgrade their fleet with younger and greener aircraft, sustainable airlines have a higher margin than traditional airlines with different fleet costs, including maintenance, fuel, and emission. Clearly, in the Cooperative Scenario, the number of passenger seat/kilometer traveled (SKT) from the old aircraft will decrease while the number of SKT from the new aircraft will increase.====Note that this model can be extended to cargo airlines if SKT was replaced by tonne/kilometer traveled. Because of the cost disadvantage of old aircraft, in equilibrium, the traditional airline has no incentives to reduce the number of SKT from old aircraft significantly in the short term—meeting the EU ETS's requirement and buying EUAs to avoid penalties is their priority. For the co-opetition relationship in the airline market, the traditional airline's cooperative strategy benefits the sustainable airline in two ways: it boosts income from ticket sales and the emission allowance trade. For simplicity, we assume consumers have no preference for airlines. According to the above discussion, we try to solve the following research questions:====As discussed in the previous sections, a general emission trade platform for a wider range of industries does not effectively control the fast growth of aviation emissions. More policies and schemes are needed to address this issue. We believe schemes that can manage and control in-sector aviation emissions is beneficial to current literature and practices, which is worth further study. Immediate action is required to address aviation's environmental impact and to further incentivize modal shifts. Revenues from the EU ETS are designated for climate and energy-related improvements, including subsidizing low-carbon innovation, such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. To the best of our knowledge, this study investigates the reactions of airlines to ETS, which lead to changes in the airline market structure and low-carbon transition. The remainder of this article is arranged in the following manner. In Section 2, we review the related literature. In Section 3, we examine the impact of EU ETS on traditional and sustainable airlines with four distinct scenarios (Benchmark, Pay Premium, Market-Based and Cooperative). In Section 4, we analyze the equilibrium outcomes of different scenarios. We present a series of numerical analyses in Section 5.

Furthermore, there is a current focus on proactive approaches for aviation performance management. Within this context, data mining initiatives such as anomaly detection have become more prominent. Dealing with anomalies is a natural step for achieving the goals regarding operational safety and efficiency, as anomalies are often related to hazardous and inefficient operations. In this work, we propose a systematic flight ==== framework for anomaly detection in flight operations in order to provide a comprehensive and reusable pipeline for model building, application, and explanation. The solution is designed to be applicable to both online and offline regimes and at multiple scales, while also building on domain-expert analysis. We demonstrate the framework applicability in two scenarios of routine flight operations monitoring considering both airline and air traffic management perspectives. In the first one, the framework is applied to aircraft performance data within an unsupervised learning setting with a density-based clustering approach for anomaly detection in landing operations at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (KMSP). The results are compared with those obtained with exceedance-based methods used in the current practice, revealing the detection of operationally significant anomalies beyond the benchmark. In the second case study, we apply the framework on flight tracking data within a supervised learning setting with the development of an autoencoder classifier for offline anomaly detection in terminal airspace arrival operations at Sao Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR). Additionally, supervised learning models are developed for anomaly explanation. The autoencoder classifier was able to detect operationally significant anomalies, while the explanatory models provided novel insights about contributing factors to the anomalies identified. For instance, we learned that anomalous arrival trajectories are more likely to be associated with landing operations on runway 27 under wind scenarios, with an increase in the odds ratio of 62% and 58% for tailwinds and headwinds, respectively. In addition, we also observed a positive association between anomalies and wind gusts situations.","With approximately 38 million scheduled commercial flights across 48,500 routes in 2019, the global aviation system is outstandingly complex (IHLG, 2019). Within the aviation system lies the flight operations subsystem, which deals with the day-to-day operations of flights. There are two principal stakeholders in the flight operations subsystem: airlines/aircraft operators and Air Traffic Management (ATM).====The utmost priority of flight operations is flight safety, be it from the airline or the ATM system point of view. Fatal accident rates for commercial flights have been continuously decreasing, making aviation the safest mode of commercial transport (Oster et al., 2013). However, current safety levels are not uniform across the world nor between each commercial aviation segment. There is thus a continuous effort to develop tools, policies, and methodologies that increase and standardize safety levels across the market. This is reinforced by the institutional emphasis and focus placed on flight safety. ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) launched the Global Aviation Safety Plan (GASP), which aims to achieve and subsequently maintain the zero-fatality level in commercial operations starting in 2030 (ICAO, 2019). The European Commission published in its vision for aviation the goal of reaching one accident or less per ten million commercial flights - a reduction of 80% compared to 2000 levels (European Commission, 2011).====One of the next challenges regarding safety is the change from an incident-based reactive approach to one which integrates a more proactive system-based predictive approach (Oster et al., 2013). The proactive approach aims at identifying a hazard before its consequences happen, either fully or partially, whereas the traditional, reactive one, involves the identification of the hazard after its consequence happens (ICAO, 2013).====In addition to safety, the aviation ecosystem has also focused on increasing efficiency. Modernization programs such as FAA’s Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) in the U.S. FAA (2019), Eurocontrol’s Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) in Europe (SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2019), and DECEA’s SIRIUS in Brazil (Departamento de Controle Do Espaço Aéreo (DECEA), 2012) aim at increasing operational efficiency while guaranteeing safety levels with new technologies and procedures.====In parallel, aviation systems generate more and more data. From the ATM standpoint, modern and more widespread surveillance equipment such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) provides detailed flight tracking information. From the aircraft operator perspective, better-equipped aircraft with modern Flight Data Recorders (e.g., QAR and DFDR) are capable of registering more parameters and at higher sampling rates.====Within this context of abundant data and focus on increasing safety levels via more proactive approaches while enhancing operational efficiency with the development of new evidence-based policies and practices, data mining initiatives for understanding and predicting aviation system behavior have become more prominent. One of these initiatives, which has drawn attention over the past years, is anomaly detection. Anomalies are patterns on data inconsistent with the expected behavior (Chandola et al., 2009). They arise in non-normal flight situations and operations, and they are often related to conditions that may generate inefficiencies in the airspace, result in increased workload for pilots and Air Traffic Control (ATC), or even lead to an unsafe situation. Therefore, dealing with anomalies is a natural step for achieving the goals regarding operational safety and efficiency. The modeling and discovery of anomalies shed light on hazardous or inefficient operations and substantiate the development of new safety and operational policies and practices for airlines and ATM.====There are various methodologies for anomaly detection within the flight data context. Over the past years, several studies on this matter have been performed, and they are analyzed more thoroughly in Section 2. Nevertheless, they all discuss study-specific steps for solving a particular formulation of the anomaly detection problem. Therefore, an extensive framework for the application of anomaly detection techniques in flight operations data is lacking. Furthermore, previous studies focus on methods for identifying anomalies and do not provide systematic tools for investigating and pointing out contributing factors to the anomalous situation. It is worth mentioning that explanation of machine learning models has been demonstrating significant importance to build trust in automation for improved usability in decision-making. Finally, with the ongoing development of machine learning models and techniques, there are still opportunities for applying novel or previously unexplored modeling approaches with proper comparison to baseline methods or current practice.====This paper presents a comprehensive two-module framework for anomaly detection and explanation in flight operations data, with an in-depth discussion, proposition, and demonstration of a reusable pipeline for model building and application. The anomaly detection module focuses on the development of data-driven models for the automatic identification of relevant anomalies without the need for an a priori specification of events and empirical thresholds. A subsequent anomaly explanation module focuses on the development of explanatory models that shed light on the most likely causes of flagged anomalies. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in two scenarios of routine flight operations monitoring considering both airline and air traffic management perspectives. In the first one, we explore aircraft performance data for landing operations at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport (KMSP) and performed anomaly detection with an unsupervised learning approach using a density-based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), while comparing the results with the current industry practice of exceedance detection. In the second application, we explore surveillance data for terminal airspace operations at Sao Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) with the application of isolation forests for anomaly detection in arrival trajectories, enabling the creation of an autoencoder classifier for offline anomaly detection. Additionally, supervised learning models are developed for anomaly explanation. With the application to two distinct scenarios of routine airline and ATM operations monitoring, we show how the framework is able to identify relevant anomalies (not detected by currently used methods) and provide novel insights about contributing factors to inefficiencies and potential unsafe events. For instance, with the construction of explanatory models, we learn that the anomalous situations at SBGR are more likely to be associated with landing operations on runway 27 under wind scenarios, with an increase in the odds ratio of 62% and 58% for tailwinds and headwinds, respectively.====The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the anomaly detection problem and reviews the related literature, as well as remarks regarding the anomaly detection process and current practice.

If so, do public commercial airports compete with each other? In this study, we investigated airport competition by applying the data of 59 U.S. hub airports from 2009 to 2019 in a Cliff-Ord typed spatial model. The model includes two modules: the first module captures the impact of neighboring airports on the airport's output with a spatial lag dependent variable, while the second module considers the bias resulting from spatial autoregressive error term. The results suggest that the airports' outputs are spatially and negatively dependent; namely, an increase in the outputs of neighboring airports leads to a decrease in the output of an airport. This indicates the existence of airport competition. In addition, we found that the outputs of airports governed by city and state are greater than those of ones governed by the port/airport authority after controlling for all other factors.","U.S. commercial airports are public infrastructure managed by state, county, city, or local government authorities. It is often assumed that public airports may be apathetic to competition (Bel and Fageda, 2007). However, airports are not different from other business entities as they compete with each other to retain and increase traffic volumes (IATA Economics Briefing No, 2013). In the last four decades, two important factors have restructured the air transport industry in the world: airport privatization in Europe and airline deregulation in the U.S. (Button, 2017).====Following the British Airports Authority (BAA) privatization by the British government in 1987, European airports have been managed by either private firms or public-private partnerships (Pavlyuk, 2012). Consequently, airport competition in Europe has been a subject of many studies; for example, Barrett (2000), Bel and Fageda (2010), D'Alfonso et al. (2015), Malighetti et al. (2009), Pavlyuk (2009), and Scotti et al. (2012). The second factor is the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA) of 1978 in the US. Airline competition following the deregulation impacted all stakeholders in air transportation (Peterson, 2018). One of the notable operational changes in the sector is the hub-and-spoke system in which an airport is selected as the hub or transfer point of a number of usually smaller airports (the spokes) (Smith and Cox, 2012). American Airlines is the pioneer of this system as it adopted Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) as a hub airport in 1979 (Peterson, 2018). The hub-and-spoke network provides many advantages to airlines in terms of their operations and marketing (Pickrell, 2017), and helps airlines reduce average costs through economies of density (Brueckner and Zhang, 2001). The hub-and-spoke system creates the “agglomeration economies” that benefit airlines and passengers (Starkie, 2002). For example, by concentrating services at the hub, airlines can provide more frequent flights to large cities, and passengers benefit from the network scope and increased flight frequency. Airports benefit from increased flight services and consumer demand in the form of increased revenues. The interest of airlines in the hub-and-spoke networks leads to competition between airports as airlines expand their business and services (Germa Bel and Fageda, 2007; Starkie, 2002).====Unlike the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, U.S. commercial airports are owned and run by various forms of government entities (Gillen, 2011). They finance their operations and capital projects through federal grants and revenue bond issuance. According to Gillen (2011), there was an increased interest in airport privatization in the last decade. However, the anti-privatization provision in the FAA Reauthorization Bill 2010 precludes privatized airports from receiving federal funding (Gillen 2011). The call for privatization was based generally on the arguments that government airports were not efficient, particularly in addressing the challenge of increased air traffic, rising congestion, and travel delays (Ivaldi et al., 2015). According to IATA Economics Briefing (2017), most consumers would prefer to use their local airport, implying that most airports would have some marker power. If so, and given that government-run airports receive government funding and have market power, do they compete with each other? Competition is perceived generally as welfare-enhancing as it compels firms to be cost-efficient, lowers prices, and expands outputs.====In this study, we investigate the existence of spatial output interdependence between neighboring airports. Output interdependence may be an indicator of competition between airports. In a Cournot oligopoly model, rival firms compete on output, and an increase in the output of one firm would lead to a decrease in the rivals’ outputs. The Cournot model assumes that the firms are rational profit maximizers. This paper aims to throw light on airport competition on the output given that the airports are not-for-profit government-owned and operated entities. This subject of competition between government-owned airports has not been empirically examined by past studies. We use the data on 59 U.S. hub airports between the years 2009 and 2019 to investigate the impact of spatial interaction between neighboring airports and the determinants of their outputs via a spatial autoregressive random-effects model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine U.S. airport output competition using a spatial regression model. The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. In the following section, we provide a brief review of previous studies about airport competition. We present the method in Section 3; Section 4 provides information on the data; the results are discussed in Section 5; finally, we conclude and discuss the policy implications in Section 6.",Spatial dependence and competition between U.S. airports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001740,18 April 2023,2023,Research Article,13.0

The “flight shame” movement causes some passengers to leave the market while allowing for some willingness-to-pay for cleaner technologies. Starting from a horizontally differentiated duopoly between airlines with old technology and an uncovered market, the introduction of hydrogen technology provides the opportunity for vertical differentiation in line with the increased environmental consciousness of passengers. The principal methodological novelties start from an uncovered market and combine horizontal and vertical differentiation. The main results are the airlines’ optimal strategy sets and the adoption strategy dynamics with an increased valuation of quality by passengers. We justify a regulator’s intervention and draw several potential policy implications from this dynamic, such as a minimum subsidy level and educational ====.","The global COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and 2021 has created a huge market shock affecting all industries, sectors, and numerous aspects of daily life, along with significant uncertainties and devastating economic and financial losses for many. The air transport industry is one of the most impacted sectors, and this trend has continued. This creates a significant negative market shock on the passenger air transport market, which may be structural. Therefore, this paper provides a review of the passenger–airlines game.====The air transport industry represents the most substantial energy-consuming transport sector per capita==== (Gössling and Upham, 2009, Grewe et al., 2017) in the world. The air transport industry is one of four major contributors to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with the emission levels from air transport predicted to expand rapidly. In addition, taking a flight may cause the most intense carbon emission generated by an individual for a given time. For instance, the shortest ranged flights emit more carbon per person than the average annual emission from an individual of some emerging countries. Thus, emissions from the air transport industry are increasingly attracting the attention of passengers. With the influence of some environmental activists (such as the Swedish singer Staffan Linberg and activist Greta Thunberg), the “flight shame” movement started in 2017. Some passengers ceased flying due to the carbon emissions levels of aircraft. Because air travel is an individual choice that significantly affects GHG emissions, passengers may experience a sense of “shame” in choosing to fly. For example, Sweden has seen a 4% passenger reduction in air travel from 2018 to 2019. When passengers have information on their ==== emissions, the associated carbon footprint may become one of the critical factors driving passengers’ purchasing decisions.====Currently, one of the most promising innovations is to introduce hydrogen as a clean energy supply at airports. Hydrogen can be obtained and burned without carbon emission if the electricity used to electrolyze water is “green”.==== Hydrogen is the most common chemical element on our planet, which allows it to be a sustainable energy source, thus strengthening energy security. Hydrogen also offers ways to decarbonize the long-haul transport sectors. Furthermore, clean hydrogen==== helps to improve air quality. Gillingham and Stock (2018) states that using hydrogen as a fuel in the transport sector is considered an option in reaching stringent reduction targets. Dincer and Acar (2016) review the potential use of hydrogen in aviation applications and show that hydro-based electrolysis is the most advantageous. Janić (2018) compares fuel consumption and related emissions of GHGs (Green House Gases) for three types of fuels: first, conventional Jet-A1/8; plus two alternative SPK (synthetic paraffinic kerosene) and ==== (liquid hydrogen), and finds that the use of liquid hydrogen would start almost immediately to reduce the direct cumulative emissions of ====. A greener technology introduced in air transport can lead to significant positive externality (for the environment and for the health condition of individuals) and may entice some passengers back to the market. The introduction of hydrogen and the new services related to the use of this energy source can thus be considered a breakthrough innovation and may therefore be one of the solutions for airlines to reduce ==== emissions when facing the flight shame movement, or more generally, the increasing environmental consciousness of passengers.====Despite the obvious advantage of carbon-free hydrogen, the energy production of hydrogen is more costly than that of kerosene. The fixed costs for hydrogen technology (such as the necessary infrastructures or the intellectual property rights) and the variable costs (including hydrogen production costs and labor training costs) are both higher than for kerosene technology. Researchers typically focus on the efficiency gain of the variable cost to model innovation with high fixed costs. However, for hydrogen technology, it is unlikely in the short term that hydrogen technology in air transport will yield an efficiency gain.====Moreover, the flight shame movement and other surveys provide evidence that passengers are focusing more and more on the carbon footprint generated by aircraft. Bateson et al. (2006) suggests that individuals are particularly sensitive to psychological and social concerns when deciding to buy green products.==== Therefore, instead of focusing on the efficiency gain of the innovation, this paper focuses on the value placed by passengers on the quality (green property and less noisy for electric use) of hydrogen technology. This innovation will induce potential changes in the expected revenue of the various stakeholders in the air transport system. This paper studies the adoption game and illustrates the essence of strategic interaction. Moreover, it assesses the green technology adoption under a market impacted by a negative market shock and provides new policy implications that may reshape the industry’s future.====The optimal design of a product line has been a core question in the product line literature dating back to Hotelling, 1929, Mussa and Rosen, 1978 and Gabszewicz and Thisse (1979). The horizontal differentiation is further developed by d’Aspremont et al., 1979, Neven, 1985, Bester et al., 1996, Neven, 1986, Tabuchi and Thisse, 1995, Balvers and Szerb, 1996 and Fujita and Thisse (1986). And the vertical differentiation model is further developed by Shaked and Sutton, 1983, Champsaur and Rochet, 1989, Moorthy and Png, 1992, Johnson and Myatt, 2003 and Carlton and Dana (2008).====Trends to combine horizontal and vertical differentiation can also be found in the literature. Neven and Thisse (1987) suggest that a “principle of max–min differentiation” might hold in markets involving horizontal and vertical characteristics. Ferreira and Thisse (1996) build a variant of the Hotelling (1929) model where vertical differentiation presents in the asymmetric transportation cost. Gabszewicz and Wauthy (2012) build another variant of the Hotelling (1929) model, which nests horizontal and vertical differentiation by assuming the asymmetric natural markets’ size of firms. Mantovani et al. (2016) study the competition between a green firm and a “brown” competitor with their products differentiated along two dimensions: hedonic quality and environmental quality. To date, our paper is the first to build a framework starting from an uncovered market,==== allowing a firm to choose between the green and brown technology when the new technology brings more product differentiation and thus influencing the market structure.====We start from an uncovered market; that is, not every consumer in the market will make a purchase decision. Because of the considerable market shock due to the current COVID-19 crisis and the flight shame movement, there is a shock of consumers’ willingness-to-pay for polluting flights. Thus, the participation constraint is not always satisfied for every consumer. Some consumers cease purchasing flights due to the negative utility of consuming flights. As consumers have an increasing level of environmental consciousness,==== they, therefore, have an extra utility for a flight that uses hydrogen technology. The market size varies with the consumers’ reserve utility and the extra utility for the new hydrogen technology.====To capture the competition effect with the simplest model, we assume that there are duopoly airlines and heterogeneous passengers in the market. Before the new technology is available, duopoly airlines are horizontally differentiated on a given route. For the same route at the same price, some passengers may prefer to buy from one airline, and some from another airline. According to the 2002 U.S. Department of Commerce survey, the variety of flights that consumers care about includes previous experiences with the carrier, loyalty programs that accumulate points, whether the carrier is the national brand for consumers, and business partnerships between the workplace and the airline. The above characteristics are not related to the quality of the air product (exact departure and destination airport, same slot, same aircraft type, same service quality, including luggage, leg space, food and beverage on-board, same walking distance to the gate, etc.), thus related to the horizontal differentiation and location, as passengers consume the same air product. The variety of flights offered is the airlines’ response to passengers’ heterogeneous preferences. These varieties of flight are already there before the adoption game; therefore, these product characteristics/varieties do not lead to higher operating costs for the airlines.====The introduction of hydrogen technology in the air transport sector is assessed when the initial market is uncovered. There are both price effects and volume effects for the adoption game. We find that the duopoly airlines’ strategy choices depend on the level of the passengers’ valuation of hydrogen technology flights. We draw the evolution of duopoly airlines’ strategies with the increase in passengers’ valuation for hydrogen technology flights. We also justify the regulator’s intervention and draw several interesting policy implications such as the minimum subsidy level and educational advertising from this dynamic. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate vertical differentiation on the technology of production and horizontal differentiation starting from an uncovered market as to capture the global impact of green innovation on passengers.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 drives the setting, assumptions, and pre-innovation scenario of the model. In Section 3, the hydrogen technology associated with passengers’ environmental consciousness becomes available. We present the impact of introducing this technology to the airlines’ strategy. Section 4 provides some policy implications following the dynamics of strategy choices with increased passengers’ environmental consciousness. A final section concludes and suggests further research directions.",Modeling technology changes in air transport in the presence of a market shock: A passenger-based analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001594,13 April 2023,2023,Research Article,15.0

Based on these findings, this study investigated a type of non-trading behavior observed in the context of airfare booking. Required by the pricing and ","For the airline industry, it has been a tradition to segment passengers based on trip purpose and aligned their fare products with flexibility for business travelers and discounts for others (Teichert et al., 2008). Such a segmentation scheme has been used as the foundation for airlines’ pricing strategy and revenue management (RM) in the past few decades, but its effectiveness has been eroding fast in recent years.====With the wide popularity of online booking, information on competitive airfares is becoming easily accessible. Facing intensified competition from budget airlines, traditional airlines have simplified the restrictions on the fare segment and removed some most rigorous restrictions from discount fare classes, which eased different types of customers to access various discounted fares. This requires the airlines to adjust their segmentation scheme to better accommodate the behavior heterogeneity of the customers.====In the framework of discrete choice modelling, behavioural heterogeneity can be expressed in various forms (Gopinath, 1995; Swait and Bernardino, 2000). As one of the most extensively investigated sources of heterogeneity in air travel choice studies, ==== are generally modelled as shifts in attribute sensitivities across dimensions of observable individual characteristics (e.g. income, age, occupations, etc.) and/or trip-related information (e.g. trip purpose, travel distance, travel frequency, etc.). Alternatively, randomness that is unobservable to the analysts is often captured through ==== in which heteroskedasticity and correlations over alternatives are induced to allow flexible substitution patterns along different choice dimensions (e.g. access mode, airfare, flights and/or carriers).====Although other sources of heterogeneity are less of a concern in the context of air travel, there are still a few studies focusing specifically on these matters. For ====, Collins et al. (2013) looked at the impact of a non-utility-maximization (non-UM) information processing strategy known as attribute non-attendance (ANA) in a stated preference (SP) study for short-haul flights; Koo et al. (2018) investigated how the elimination-by-aspect (EBA) rule is utilised by air travellers for alternative screening in the choice of international flights. For ====, Başar and Bhat (2004) derived an airport choice model based on the two-stage choice set generation process proposed by Manski (1977), in which the consideration set – that is, the set of airports actually considered by each decision maker – varied across the population. Fleischer et al. (2012) and Brey and Walker (2011) analyzed the impact of ==== (i.e. fear of flying and perceived travel time, respectively), which are not directly observable by the analyst and therefore often treated as latent variables, in the flight/itinerary choice. There is also an air travel choice study exploring ====, and the result of the study suggests that, apart from ====, the incorporation of ==== is useful in explaining the wide variations of behaviour from near lexicographic to highly random behaviour where choices are trivially influenced by observed attributes (Hossain et al., 2018).====Based on the above findings, this study investigated the behavior heterogeneity among airfare bookers in a SP data setting. Although airlines have a long history of using readily available revealed preference (RP) data (e.g. booking records) for demand forecasting, such a data source is not suitable for uncovering heterogeneity in process of decision-making for the reasons: (a) generally, there is only one choice made by each decision maker, and/or (b) information on other fare offerings at the time of booking may not always be available.====In this study, a SP survey that allows hierarchical fare structure and variation in choice set composition — different alternatives in each choice set — is designed to collect choice data. Such an arrangement mimics airfare booking scenarios in reality — airfares are hierarchical in price, service levels and fare restrictions and due to capacity limitation, some airfare alternatives on a flight might be sold out when a booking decision is being made. In addition, controlling the availability of an alternative may effectively reveal the sequence of choices made by each airfare booker, and this information can be useful for revealing the heterogeneous decision-making process of the decision makers.====With the proposed SP method, nearly half of the respondents exhibited non-trading behavior, and to capture such heterogeneity, a mixed logit (ML) model with a latent variable was analyzed. Such type of model is also known by the name integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model. The estimation results suggest that identifying the non-trading behavior significantly improves the accuracy of parameter estimates, overall fit, and explanatory power; and such models yield significantly different forecasting results. The finding of this study is valuable for airlines in terms of developing new market segmentation techniques, and it provides some insights for policy-makers on privacy and safety related risks that may arise alongside the development of new segmentation techniques.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Annual data on all the variables were analyzed using cointegration and error-correction modelling techniques. Empirical results reveal long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. The impact of the variables on air cargo demand vary across the countries. Gross domestic product per capita is a major determinant of air cargo demand in Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa in the short and long term. Real income positively influenced air cargo demand in these countries. For Kenya, real interest rate has positive long-run effect on air cargo demand. Implementation of measures that will enhance economic development, trade and improve airport infrastructure are necessary.","The demand for air cargo services has increased over the past decades. This manifests in the increased volume of air cargo traffic transported between countries. Globally, air cargo traffic increased from 38 million tons in 2005 to 57.6 million tons in 2019. In terms of distance, air cargo traffic increased from 142,580 million ton-km in 2005 to 225,001 million ton-km in 2019 (ICAO, 2006, 2019a, 2019b). The increase in air cargo volume was enhanced by economic growth, political stability, liberalization policies, improvement in customs quality and reduction in corruption (Suryani et al., 2012). Some airlines which previously considered cargo services as by-product of passenger operations now provide full cargo services due to the high revenue generated from air cargo services. Cargo revenues generated by airlines increased from 66.7 billion US$ in 2004 to 100.8 billion US$ in 2019 (IATA, 2021).====Air cargo industry plays a significant role in global sourcing and trade (Lo et al., 2015). Although less than one percent of global trade by tonnage is transported by air, goods worth over six trillion US$ are transported by air every year. Hence, air cargo accounts for more than 35% of global trade (Boeing commercial Airplanes, 2018). Goods transported by air are mainly high-value goods such as high-tech products, machinery, and electrical equipment; time-sensitive cargo such as just-in-time spare parts used for assembly by manufacturers and perishables like pharmaceuticals, cut flowers, fruits and vegetables. These goods require speed, reliability, and security.====The volume of air cargo traffic varies across regions in the world. In 2019, Asia and Pacific region had the highest (37.7%) share of air cargo shipments while Africa had the least (1.9%). With respect to international services, total cargo ton-km performed in Africa grew by 6.3% in 2005, 2.8% in 2016, declined by 0.4% in 2018 and increased by 5.7% in 2019 (ICAO, 2006, 2016, 2018, ICAO, 2019a). Similar growth was recorded in passenger traffic in the region such that total revenue-passenger kilometers increased by 4.9% in 2019 (ICAO, 2019a). The growth in Africa's air transport is associated with economic growth, implementation of regulatory reforms that increased market access, investment flows and reduced costs (Njoya and Knowles, 2020). Boeing commercial Airplanes (2018) estimates that air cargo shipment between Africa and East Asia and North America will increase by 6.1% and 5.3% annually from a small base during the period 2017–2037. The African Continental Free Trade Area and Single African Air Transport Market agreements are expected to enhance intraregional trade and increase air cargo traffic.====A large number of empirical studies have examined the determinants of air passenger demand (Ba-fail et al., 2000; Bieger et al., 2007; Dobruszkes et al., 2011; Gillen and Hasheminia, 2013; Sivrikaya and Tunç, 2013; Valdes, 2015; Hakim and Merkert, 2019) but analysis of air cargo demand have attracted little attention (Mayer, 2016). With the exception of Tolcha et al. (2020), most of the studies that examined factors influencing the demand for air cargo (Kasarda and Green, 2005; Matsumoto, 2004; Chang and Chang 2009; Kupfer et al., 2012; Button and Yuan, 2013; Yao and Yang, 2012; Suryani et al., 2012; Chao and Hsu, 2014; Lo et al., 2015; Chi, 2016; Kupfer et al., 2017; Van Asch et al., 2019) focused mainly on high-income countries with mature aviation markets in North America and Europe. It is important to determine the factors driving air cargo traffic in low-income countries such as those in Africa since the spatial, economic, cultural and social characteristics of geographical areas vary (Hakim and Merkert, 2016). The short-run and long-run relationship between air cargo demand and its drivers including economic growth, trade, jet fuel price, and population might be different in Africa compared to other regions.====Understanding the nature of the short-and long-run relationship between air cargo demand and its determinants is important to governments, airlines, airports, logistic companies, transportation planners, other stakeholders and policymakers (Zhang and Graham, 2020). It will guide policy makers to implement strategies that will increase air cargo demand. It is also important for corporate planning, development of infrastructure, forecasting, investment risk reduction, improve service efficiency and government regulation (Hakim and Merkert, 2019).====Few studies in the literature have examined issues relating to air cargo in African countries. For instance, Dettmer et al. (2014) evaluated trade integration in Southern Africa by classifying air cargo products in the region. Adenigbo (2016) analyzed factors influencing choice of Abuja airport cargo transshipment operations. Button (2020) examined Africa's floriculture air cargo supply chain. Using data from six sub-Saharan African countries, Tolcha et al. (2020) investigated the causal relationship between air cargo demand and economic development measured by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Other variables which influence demand for air cargo were used as control variables in the analysis.====This study aim to fill this gap in the literature by examining the impact of real income, foreign direct investment, trade, jet fuel price, and real interest rate on air cargo demand in selected African countries over the period 1980 to 2019. The short-run dynamics and long-run impacts of these factors on air cargo demand in each of the selected countries was investigated. Both the short- and long-run dynamics are integrated in a single model since the short-run correction process of the air transport industry in response to the explanatory variables could be different from the long-run process (Chi and Baek, 2012).====In terms of the study context, this study focuses on selected countries in Africa, specifically, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa. The countries were selected based on their geographical location, availability of data and volume of air cargo traffic. Based on geographical location, Kenya represents eastern Africa, Nigeria represents western Africa, Egypt represents northern Africa while southern Africa is represented by South Africa. Data could not be obtained on air cargo traffic and the explanatory variables for the countries in central Africa, hence, none of the countries was selected. The sample countries including Ethiopia are the leading air cargo markets in Africa as of 2020 (African Airlines Association, 2020). Economic activities in Africa is concentrated among few countries. Hence, there is a wide variation in the level of economic development as measured by GDP per capita among the sample countries. In 2019, for example, South Africa had the highest GDP per capita with $7345.9 followed by Egypt ($2907.3), Nigeria ($2386.9) and Kenya ($1237.5). In the same year, the volume of air cargo (million ton-km) was 539 in South Africa, 483 in Egypt, 321 in Kenya and 22 in Nigeria (World Bank, 2020). Fig. 1 shows the historical trend of air cargo traffic in sample countries. South Africa had the highest volume of air cargo while Nigeria had the lowest volume during the study period. In South Africa, the volume of air cargo increased from 251.2 million ton-km in 1980 to 442.9 million ton-km in 1984 followed by a steady decline to 199.0 million ton-km in 1991. Air cargo volume increased steadily to a peak of 1233.0 million ton-km in 2006, then declined gradually to 539.4 million ton-km in 2019. In Egypt, air cargo volume increased from 29.3 million ton-km in 1980 to 483.4 million ton-km in 2019. Air cargo volume in Kenya rose from 18 million ton-km in 1980 to 321 million ton-km in 2019. In Nigeria, volume of air cargo increased from 9.3 million ton-km in 1980 to a maximum level of 37.2 million ton-km in 1987 followed by a steady decline to 22.0 million ton-km in 2019. The growth in air cargo traffic in Nigeria is very low compared to South Africa, Egypt and Kenya. Similar variation manifests in various indices of air services including airline seating capacity, level of liberalization, number of domestic and international destinations, and frequency of scheduled services. For instance, in 2018, Egypt had the highest number of international destinations served by airlines followed by Morocco, Ethiopia, Algeria and Kenya (International Civil Aviation Organization, 2016).

As a result, the transportation industry has become one of the major contributors to global GGE production (29% in USA and 15% in the world). Civil aviation is responsible for 12% of all GGE produced by the transportation industry. Growing concern over global climate changes caused by human activities and increasing public awareness have been challenging the transportation industry to reduce its environmental footprints. In general, companies focused on technological solutions to offset the transportation industry's contribution to GGE. On the other hand, operations management literature suggests that airline companies focusing on operational excellence with an objective to minimize fuel consumption burn up to 25–42% less fuel than those less efficient carriers (Zou et al., 2014).====Several conditions (internal and external) cause inefficiencies at airports, such as adopted technology, weather conditions, state of the infrastructure, ground service quality, relationship with airlines, runway capacity, and collaboration with other airports and air traffic control authorities. Inefficient operations at airports lead to congestion which eventually results in delays and more fuel consumption. Total cost of flight delays in United States is estimated to be between $30 billion to $38 billons per year (Ball et al., 2010 and Peterson et al., 2013). Additional fuel consumption due to delays constitutes 20% of the total delay cost (Ball et al., 2010). Until recently, the aviation industry had tackled the fuel consumption problem as a cost issue. In recent years, due to the increasing public awareness and government regulations, the environmental impact of fossil fuel usage has become an important consideration in aviation industry. Today, airline companies are not only focusing on reducing their fuel consumption costs, but they are also working with governments and the public to reduce the negative impact of the airline industry on the environment.====As fuel expenses are the second largest cost item for airline companies, aircraft manufacturers have invested a great deal of resources to produce more fuel-efficient aircraft in order to gain market share. As a result, significant gains in fuel consumption have been observed. Today, the new aircraft burns an average of 45% less fuel than aircraft made in 1960s (Kharina and Rutherford, 2015; Mirazova, 2013). While the impact of technological improvements on fuel consumption was considerably rapid in between 1960 and 1990 (35% reduction), rate of improvements due to technological advances has been relatively small since 1990 (total 10% from 1990 to 2015) (Kharina and Rutherford, 2015). The literature suggests that the further reduction of fuel consumption is possible through the improvement of air traffic and airport operations management (Zhang and Wang, 2017 and Samà et al., 2019).====The airline industry estimates that an average of 4%–7% of fuel is burnt during ground activities at airports (taxing, waiting, and extra fuel carried in order to complete the journey at the destination airport) (Khadilkar and Balakrishnan, 2012; Nikoleris et al., 2011; Gebicki, 2018). Aircraft burns 5 to 18 gallons of fuel per minute during taxiing. The average fuel consumption during taxiing at Chicago's O'Hare airport is estimated to be an average of 9 gallons per minute. While emissions created by airport activities directly impact the GGE problem around the world, having been located very close to residential areas, airports pose significant health risks to the public (Upham et al., 2003; Lu, 2011). Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to study the impact of the electrification of airport taxiing operations on both GGE and airport traffic efficiency. In other words, this paper evaluates the electric powered taxiing alternatives and introduces a mathematical model for optimal aircraft tow-tractor assignment and aircraft routing to perform taxiing operations.====In order to optimize the terminal area traffic flow at airports (runway utilization, gate utilization and taxiing operations), several academic studies in the form of linear programming (LP) have been proposed (Ng et al., 2020; Das et al., 2020). Although many of these LP solutions to airport operations in theory show promising results to improve traffic flow, due to their lack of collision and conflict resolution capabilities, they are either not implemented or only used as a planning tool to support ATCOs to manage the actual traffic. In the literature, only a handful of researchers have tackled the collision and conflict avoidance issue as part of network optimization, vehicle routing, assignment, or scheduling problems. Clare and Richards (2011) modeled aircraft taxiing process in consideration with collision avoidance. Yin et al. (2012) used similar conflict resolution constraints to model taxiing operations at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Moeini et al. (2012) and Soltani et al. (2020) utilized similar strategies to model conflict resolution as part of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solution for ground traffic control. Yet, the large body of researchers tackled airport operations management and collision and conflict avoidance problems aviation industry separately (Tang 2019, Akgunduz et al., 2018). Consequently, those airport ground operations management models without collision and conflict avoidance features, have never been fully implemented in real-life applications. As a result, today, both air-traffic and ground-traffic operations are still being managed by Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) and ramp managers. While the availability of sophisticated technology provides more comfortable working conditions for the ATCOs, monitoring airplanes and giving instructions to pilots, to provide save flight conditions, still requires experience, knowledge, and strong emotional stability. Moreover, human controlled airport ground operations management practices lead to less efficient taxiing operations resulting in delays and extra fuel consumption.====In their work, Soltani et al. (2020) formulated the collision and conflict avoidance as part of a general aircraft taxiing operations planning model. Their work, on the other hand, did not consider the stochastic nature of airport operations. Accordingly, this paper further extends the capabilities of the MILP solution proposed by Soltani et al. in order to manage airport operations under stochastic conditions. The proposed method considers the usage of electric powered airplane tow-tractors as an alternative taxiing method, while incorporating collision and conflict avoidance. The MILP model enabled us to minimize fuel usage, delay costs, and separate airplanes from each other by the desired minimum separation limits. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed MILP under stochastic conditions, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. In this study, we also introduce a tow-tractor purchasing policy in order to help airport authorities to make the most economic decisions during tow-tractor acquisition.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief literature review is provided. In Section 3, the formulation of the collision and conflict free airport operations is formulated as a MILP model. Sample cases are solved and discussed in section 4.

The empirical results indicate that improvement in efficiency is the key source of the productivity gains of the overall system, the first stage, as well as the second stage. Furthermore, the productivity improvement of the first and second stages simultaneously drives the overall productivity progress. Most airlines experience productivity growth in the sample period.","There has been rise in competition in the air transport market due in part to the deregulation of the European, North American, and Far East airline industries as well as the entry of low cost carriers. In addition, although the airline industry expanded at around twice the economic growth rate in 2011 (Bhaskara, 2012), the industry still faces problems of the global economic recession and fluctuating crude oil prices. Many airlines went bankrupt or were merged because of rising competition, increased costs of operation, and reduced profit margins. For example, US Airways was merged with American Airlines in 2013, and Monarch Airlines went bankrupt in 2017. Given these changes, airlines must effectively use their resources and to go for innovation in their operations in order to enhance their competitive advantage. In the airline industry, productivity is one of the factors that describes the possible degree of sustainable growth (Davey et al., 2007; Parast and Fini, 2010). Managers of airlines can obtain long-term insights in competitive advantage by analyzing changes in productivity over time. Hence, productivity improvement is an important topic for managers of airlines. Several proposed methods assess the changes in performance of airlines over time, such as multilateral total factor productivity index (Caves et al., 1981; Windle, 1991; Oum and Yu, 1995), the Fisher productivity index (Ray and Mukherjee, 1996), and the Malmquist productivity index (MPI). The MPI has, so far, been the most popular technique employed in airline productivity literature (Seufert et al., 2017). Traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based MPI is adopted to compute the productivity index of a group of decision making units (DMUs) without considering the operation of the internal component processes; this often produces misleading results. Moreover, it is not sufficient just to recognize the paths towards success for the airlines; the process requires mechanisms to appraise choices and trace progress. Therefore, network DEA (NDEA)-based MPI is recommended.====From the definitions of the geometric mean MPI, we note that both the technological change (TC) and efficiency change (EC) are based on the ratio of overall DMU technical efficiency measures at time ====+1 and ==== within-period or adjacent-period under constant returns to scale (CRS). The measures of EC and TC, i.e., the comparison of complete technologies at periods ==== and ====+1 are, however, the geometric mean MPI has three major drawbacks. First, it is not circular. Second, its adjacent period components may give disparate measurements of productivity change. Third, when using linear programming (LP) techniques to calculate and decompose MPI, it remains susceptible to LP infeasibility.====To open a black-box, it is necessary to emphasize that researchers have utilized various partial orientations of NDEA models, behavioral assumptions, decomposition definitions, and of course, research methods (including envelopment form and multiplier form). These differences in research approaches most likely lead to incongruity across outcomes. In addition, the current literature does not strictly consider the three shortcomings of NDEA-based MPI in the aforementioned geometric mean black-box MPIs. In other words, there is no existent relevant literature on NDEA-based MPI that can handle these problems. Moreover, the standard decomposition of productivity change which isolates scale economies, EC, from pure technical efficiency change (PEC) still portrays a gap which is essential to be better examined in airline network production structure. We present a decomposition of productivity change based on the variable returns to scale (VRS) frontier of a two-stage network production structure. We use the proportional directional distance function (PDDF) of NDEA-VRS to measure technological change. The problem of internal inconsistency caused by the use of CRS and VRS in the same decomposition of Malmquist index can be overcome. While this affects the scale efficiency change (SEC) measure, the pure technological change (PTC) measure is unaffected.====We show that by building an NDEA-based MPI decomposition and specifying a base period technology, it is possible to build the production technology with a network production structure and solve the geometric mean MPI problem. To eschew the limitations of the geometric mean MPI and consider the operational characteristics of an airline, this paper extends the concept of Pastor and Lovell (2005) to propose a novel decomposition of the simultaneously-oriented global MPI (GMPI) based on NDEA model. Encompassing both output distance functions as well as input distance functions, the index is concurrently oriented (Bjurek, 1994, 1996). Moreover, the proposed NDEA-based GMPI (NGMPI) is associated with the PDDF in measuring the productivity change of international airlines. The NGMPI can overcome drawbacks of geometric mean MPI as well as provide meaningful airline productivity decomposition under a network production structure.====The proposed NGMPI was used to measure productivity growth, efficiency changes, and technological changes in international airlines which faced rising competition from 2009 to 2018, assuming CRS to explore the source of change for each stage. In addition, Merkert and Morrell (2012) indicate that due to imperfect competition, budgetary restrictions, and regulatory constraints in the airline industry, airlines often operate at an inefficient scale. Hence, the scale effect should also be explored. For this reason, we also decompose individual stage–productivity change assuming VRS to discover possible sources of system productivity change.====Empirical results show that the improvement in efficiency is the key source of the productivity gains of the overall system, the first stage as well as the second stage. Furthermore, the productivity improvement of the first and second stages simultaneously drive the overall productivity progress. Most airlines experience productivity growth in the sample period. Another finding is that the degrees of variation among airlines for the first and second stages are biggest in the period of 2009–2010, indicating that airlines have different variety of productivity during this period. The changes in other periods tend to be consistent.====The main contribution of this paper to the literature is the provision of the NGMPI which avoids the drawbacks of the geometric mean MPI and opens the black-box. Secondly, this paper relaxes the restriction of CRS by considering economies of scale, and decomposes the productivity change into the PTC, PEC and SEC. Thirdly, this paper provides a new method based on the NGMPI to compute productivity change, as well as its decomposition components for international airlines, which is immune to the infeasibility of LP. These results can provide more knowledge for airline operators as well as for policy makers to understand the content of the productivity change.====The structure of the remaining paper is as follows. Related literature is reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, PDDF is integrated into a basic two-stage NDEA model from the network structure, and shows that the proposed NDEA model can be used to derive a decomposition of NGMPI. Section 4 reports our empirical results on data from the international airlines from 2009 to 2018. The managerial implications are discussed in Section 5. The main conclusions are explained in Section 6.

We use the nonlinear autoregressive ","There is a general consensus on the developmental benefits of international travel and tourism (Dibeh et al., 2020).==== Income generated by incoming travellers helps alleviate poverty, and improves literacy rates and the standard of living for the destination economy (Kumar et al., 2022a). The UNWTO (2020) emphasized that 2019 was a year of strong growth in international travel. Worldwide air-travel grew by 4 percent to reach 1.5 billion in 2019. The strongest growth was noted in the Middle East at 8 percent followed by the Asia-Pacific region at 5 percent. Europe and Africa each grew at 4 percent respectively. Similarly, the year 2020 was expected to be another year of strong growth in worldwide travel. However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought international travel to a complete halt due to closure of international borders. Fiji was badly affected and GDP fell by about 21 percent (Kumar and Patel, 2022a). COVID-19 was a large negative shock in international arrivals. Yet, it is unclear whether positive shocks of similar magnitudes would increase GDP by a similar amount. Thus, the objective of this study is measure the asymmetric effect of international arrivals on Fiji's economic growth.====Asymmetries in this study is taken to mean directional asymmetries. This means that airline arrivals would not have the same quantitative effect on GDP when it increases, versus when it decreases. Theoretically, we expect directional asymmetries due to the demand led nature of airline arrivals (Nunkoo et al., 2020), and the convexities in short run aggregate supply (Karras and Stokes, 1999). Being demand led, any increase in airline arrivals would increase aggregate demand as follows. An increase in air travel would lead to an increase tourism demand and vice-versa (Law et al., 2022). This increases foreign direct investments in hotel infrastructure which support the increased growth in air travel (Chand et al., 2015; Falk, 2016; Kumar et al., 2022a). As a result, the demand for locally produced goods and services increase, which increases aggregate demand. A convex aggregate supply implies that any increase in aggregate demand should have successively smaller effects on output and consecutively larger effects on inflation. If international arrivals are demand led (Nunkoo et al., 2020), then linear models on the association between international air travel and economic growth are miss-specified. With convex aggregate supply, GDP would fall by a larger amount when international arrivals fall, compared to when international arrivals increase by an equivalent amount.====We test our predictions by using Fiji as a case study. Fiji's economy is heavily dependent on tourism arrivals. It contributes about 40 percent towards real GDP and supports around 119,000 jobs. This makes up about 37 percent of the total employment in the country (Kumar et al., 2018). The sector is projected to contribute about US$3.5 billion to Fiji's economic activity by 2028 (WTTC, 2022). Understanding the nonlinear relationship between airline arrivals and economic growth is important for policymakers at the macroeconomic level and for airline companies. If the growth effects of international arrivals do eventually taper off paving the way for higher inflation, the appropriate policy implication would be to incentivize productivity gains to sustain economic growth and mitigate the harmful effects of the rise in inflation. For airlines, higher inflation would mean a reduction in air travel by reducing tourism demand (Kumar et al., 2020a). However, if the demand for air travel is price inelastic (Kumar et al., 2020a), airline companies can increase their revenues when the price for air travel increases.====The study contributes to the literature on airline arrivals and economic growth in the following ways. First, the study confirms the presence of directional asymmetries in the relationship between air arrivals and economic growth. Using the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model (Shin et al., 2014), we find that a 1 percent increase in air arrivals would increase output per-worker by 0.13 percent. On the other hand, a 1 percent decrease in air arrivals would reduce output per-worker by 0.23 percent. The pattern of asymmetric effects is one where GDP is more sensitive to negative shocks in international arrivals compared to positive shocks. This contrasts with Kumar et al. (2020b), but agrees with Balsalobre-Lorente et al. (2021). Thus, the study develops a testable and theoretically-founded hypothesis on the pattern of asymmetric effects in the arrivals/tourism-growth literature. This may alleviate the concern of a lack of theoretical foundations in the arrivals/tourism-growth association. Second, the study provides updated evidence on the air arrivals-growth association in Fiji. The most recent study by Kumar et al. (2018) reported an elasticity of visitor arrivals of about 0.13. Surprisingly however, their study reported reverse causality from growth to tourism. Considering asymmetric causality tests (Hatemi-j, 2012), our study reports unidirectional causality from arrivals to growth irrespective of whether visitor arrivals increase or decrease.====The rest of the study is set as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature on tourism and growth, and pays attention to the relationship between air travel and tourism demand. Section 3 describes the research design of our study. Section 4 presents the results and provides discussions. Lastly, Section 5 on concludes with policy recommendations and research outlook.",Nonlinear effect of air travel tourism demand on economic growth in Fiji,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000455,28 March 2023,2023,Research Article,20.0

This might reduce airline revenues and profits. In this paper, a new mathematical model of profitability of different airline network choices in a liberalized market is proposed in terms of two particular personal features of passengers: the loyalty to a preferred airline and the fear of flying, which are assumed to be random. A detailed analysis of different network-type structures is presented and optimal solutions depending on the impact of these two random attributes for each of the networks are characterized in terms of the model parameters. The main finding is that the symmetric networks (hub-and-spoke or point-to-point) may not always be the optimal configuration, but a hybrid network configuration may be favoured in some cases. It is also shown that under certain conditions, the point-to-point network structure provides a higher total number of flights due to the fear of flying, which pushes the airlines to reduce the number of indirect routes.","Flight schedule and safety performances are major airline service quality attributes that build customer satisfaction and loyalty. Flying is very safe in comparison to other modes of transport. Namely, depending on distances travelled the probability of a lethal outcome when flying is considerably lower than the probabilities of lethal outcomes when other modes of transport are used or other sources of risk are involved. This is the result of continuous studies, investigations, and monitoring of commercial aviation. Over the past decades, airline safety performances have improved significantly reaching the highest levels in recent years. However, many people experience nervousness or anxiety when they fly, and the fear of flying affects roughly half of the population (van Gerwen et al., 2004).====Though rare, airline crashes have significant emotional consequences on passengers which cause decreased demand and, thus, significant effects on an airline’s stock price and profitability (Li et al., 2015). This is particularly noticeable in the months following the accidents (Zotova, 2017). Furthermore, when uncommon sudden events happen many people become quickly frightened. Passengers are placed in a situation of uncertainty and must often find their way to react. Moreover, after the air transport deregulation, prices of air travel decreased and the number of people who flew increased dramatically, which then resulted in crowded airport terminals and delayed boardings and take-offs. This situation adds more to passenger frustration and anxiety. However, the widespread fear among the air traveller population is mostly impacted by wars, terrorism, and political instabilities (van Gerwen et al., 2004). Thus, the fear of flying as a type of anxiety that involves extreme feeling of panic and fear when flying can be caused by different factors (e.g. previous bad experiences while flying, exposure to news about terrorism and crashes, or just the feeling that one has no control over the situation).====However, the past three years triggered an additional reason why passengers started to fear flying. Namely, since 2020 the aviation industry has been facing a new challenge and different issues: an evolving pandemic of coronavirus that shows no signs of ending for years. Feeling anxious about getting on a plane is likely to become even more widespread in a world where cabin crew and passengers wear masks, while physical distancing from other passengers is nearly impossible. Although airlines have faced various crisis before and managed to recover demand soon after, recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic might not be so easy. Fear of flying may be the highest than it has ever been, since being in an enclosed space with many strangers might lead to additional worries of getting infected. In the post-lockdown period, passengers did not resume travelling with the same intensity as before (inter alia, due to the fear of contagion during the flight), and this effect of the demand reduction was greater on intercontinental flights than on the short and medium-haul flights (Andreana et al., 2021). A return to air travel is especially fraught for those who were already afraid to fly. It is going to be a real challenge to make passengers feel comfortable flying again (Lamb et al., 2020).====The fear of flying is considered an irrational fear based on the psychological, social, and physiological factors of each affected individual (Oakes and Bor, 2010). Intensive fear of flying might cause some passengers to decide not to fly at all or to fly only if it is necessary. Also, some passengers fear flying but they still decide to fly, either with an airline they trust for safety reasons, i.e., with those they are loyal to, or another airline (De Jong et al., 2022). This paper brings a deeper study of the interaction of fear and trust and their effects on airline network structures. The goal is to capture the link between drivers for passengers (service quality, fear of flying and loyalty), and airline price–frequency choices in different network structure scenarios. Knowing the behaviour of optimal prices and optimal flight frequencies under different network scenarios is likely to incentivize the airline to implement a certain network structure.====In this paper, we follow the methodology from Babić and Kalić (2018) and Flores-Fillol (2009). The profitability models introduced include loyalty to a preferred airline represented as a random variable following a uniform law. In the presence of the loyalty factor, it is assumed that the passengers prefer a particular carrier, which means that an airline with an inferior frequency-airfare combination can also attract some passengers, as shown in Flores-Fillol (2009). We develop a more complex mathematical model and generalize the results from Babić and Kalić (2018) and Flores-Fillol (2009) in several directions. Besides brand loyalty, we consider also the influence of the fear of flying on the airline network choices. Passengers fear of flying is modelled by a random variable following a positively skewed Beta distribution. In recent years, different fears have been monitored and modelled in clinical studies and studies in psychology. We mention here the work of Elsey and Kindt (2021) and Wu et al. (2005) in which different Beta distributions are used in the modelling of various fears. By improving airline network structure and connectivity it is possible to streamline the passenger experience and reduce the stress when travelling.====In this paper, we consider both horizontal (resulting from different brand loyalty) and vertical product differentiation (resulting from different flight frequencies and travel times). The proposed model assumes the following two network structures: point-to-point (PP) and hub-and-spoke (HS). In the passenger utility function, we also include the frequency delay cost, the stochastic delay cost, and the extra cost of travelling indirectly. Each of the costs is considered separately. The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows:====The model proposed in this paper is mainly used for strategic planning and/or policy evaluation purposes. It may serve as a useful tool for the evaluation of different (event) scenarios, and to propose the optimal route allocation policy in a deregulated market. Moreover, it is argued that without a better understanding of these interrelationships, optimal network design and demand growth cannot be fully captured. The obtained results are of relevance for airline network planning as well as for designing an initiative strategy to support sustainable air transport systems. This is of particular importance in situations of global crises such as the COVID-19 outbreak that cause a significant disruption in the airline industry and a dramatical drop in demand. Similar virus outbreaks could lead to an increase in fear of flying again in the future and our model gives valuable answers on how the airline could handle such situations in terms of rerouting.====The paper is organized as follows. The literature background is presented in Section 2. Section 3 includes model setup with a detailed analysis and characterization of the optimal results for airline profits on symmetric and hybrid network structures, and a comparison between the submodels. In Section 4, the model outcomes are discussed, the obtained results are used to study the equilibrium in different airline networks, and welfare analysis and network efficiency are presented. Finally, the main outcomes and conclusions are summarized in Section 5.

Our cross-business model and cross-continental analysis builds on the index approach developed by Klophaus et al. (2012) to derive a typology of the hybridization among the largest carriers in Europe and North America in short-haul markets. Our results indicate that none of the largest European and North American carriers follows the pure LCC business model in short-haul markets, and all the LCCs in Europe and North America have adopted certain degree of hybrid strategy to offer short-haul services combining business practices traditionally considered typical for FSCs or LCCs. The results also confirm the categorization of most of the carriers labelled as FSCs. In addition, the study provides evidence of further convergence of airline business models in the short-haul market during the last decade. Still there is no standard short-haul business strategy despite common industry standards for some service features.","The archetypal low-cost carrier (LCC) business model is often described through characteristics such as a point-to-point network and a homogenous fleet that enable LCCs to operate with lower costs than traditional carriers. The essence of the LCC model is simplicity and to stimulate air travel demand with very low fares (Doganis 2019). The emergence of LCCs has had a profound impact on the airline industry worldwide, but also on airport business models, for example with a new breed of airports specializing in serving LCCs (Efthymiou and Papatheodorou 2018). The impact of LCCs on airfares and airline competition has been a long-standing research topic (e.g., Windle and Dresner 1995; Morrison 2001; Franke 2004; Pels 2008). The traditional full service carriers (FSCs) have been forced to respond by adjusting their service offerings, particularly in the short-haul markets (Tsoukalas et al., 2008; Pearson and Merkert 2014). In the meantime, the market segment for low-cost air travel started to show signs of maturing (de Wit and Zuidberg 2012). LCCs have therefore adopted certain service attributes of FSCs and have embraced a hybrid business model, albeit to varying degrees (Klophaus et al., 2012; Lohmann and Koo 2013). Despite the increasingly blurring distinction, major carriers in Europe and North America are still commonly categorized as either LCCs or FSCs. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics classifies Southwest and JetBlue as LCCs, and American, Delta and United as FSCs which it refers to as network carriers.====The persistent dichotomy between LCCs and FSCs probably relates to the fact that the largest FSCs in Europe and North America, in contrast to LCCs, are global players that serve intercontinental markets on almost all continents with long-haul flights from their hubs. FSCs have been able to maintain their long-haul market position despite various attempts by LCCs to start long-haul operations (Corbo 2017). The largest LCCs in Europe and North America focus on short-haul services, and they generally do not offer long-haul services. In contrast, FSCs typically operate a hub-and-spoke network that connects short-haul flights with long-haul flights, and often use different business strategies in short-haul markets than in long-haul markets to compete with LCCs. Intense competition has blurred the distinction between LCCs and FSCs in short-haul markets. Therefore, our main focus is on short-haul markets where both FSCs and LCCs have evolved with various adjustments of their operational and service attributes in response to market conditions. We examine the extent to which the differentiation between LCCs and FSCs applies in the provision of short-haul services or whether another classification might be more appropriate.====This study expands on Klophaus et al. (2012), which only looked at European LCCs, by including the largest North American airlines and European FSCs. Although there are differences between the European and North American air transport markets, the two regions share a fundamental commonality: a liberalized regulatory framework that allows airlines to make commercial decisions about routes, capacity and fares for both domestic and international services within each region, giving them the freedom to choose a short-haul business strategy. This regulatory landscape spurred competition and has contributed to the rapid growth of LCCs. Some LCCs are now among the largest carriers in Europe and North America. We examine the short-haul services offered by the top 10 airlines in Europe and the top 10 airlines in North America in terms of short-haul seat capacity. Coincidentally, these airlines are equally divided between LCCs and FSCs in both continents, that is, five LCCs and five FSCs on each continent. We consider short-haul services as non-stop services on routes between 500 km (311 miles) and 2500 km (1553 miles) and not mid-haul routes between 2500 km (1553 miles) and 4000 km (2485 miles), which are of much less importance for the European market than for the North American market. We adapt the index approach developed by Klophaus et al. (2012), which uses a set of operational and service attributes including fleet composition and network characteristics as well as airfare and product attributes to assess short-haul services.====Our study contributes to the literature in three aspects. First, while the topic of airline business models has been extensively researched, there has not yet been a study on the provision of short-haul services with a cross-continental perspective. The evolution of airline business models has not been confined within a particular geographical region. A well-known example of this is that Ryanair's low-cost strategy was initially inspired by the U.S. based Southwest. Our cross-continental analysis provides new insights into airline business strategies in short-haul markets. For example, our results indicate a more pronounced convergence in short-haul business strategies of North American airlines compared to their European counterparts; Second, we provide empirical evidence that there is still a clear demarcation in the provision of short-haul services between carriers in accordance with the carriers' commonly accepted classification as either LCC or FSC despite ongoing hybridization of airline business models in recent years; Third, our results suggest that none of the large LCCs follows the “pure” LCC model and that the so-called ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) in North America, despite the moniker of “ultra-low-cost”, actually deviate more from the original LCC business model than the European LCCs that are not affiliated with FSCs.====The reminder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a synopsis of empirical studies which measure the degree of similarity or difference between airline business models. Section 3 describes the research setup with a definition of short-haul routes and a description of the applied index approach to assess and compare the short-haul services offered by the surveyed carriers along a common set of attributes.

Specifically, the aircraft heavy maintenance service provided by an independent maintenance service company alleviates airlines' fixed-asset investments and daily operations regarding maintenance. On the other hand, the fluctuations in MROs service capability, availability and service level also affect airlines' fleet management and daily operations if their maintenance demands cannot be met in a timely manner. In this regard, the impact of the collaborations between airlines and maintenance service company is investigated from the perspective of airline's operations, by studying the maintenance planning problem at operational level. Afterwards, to examine and investigate the impact of collaborations between the two parties have on airline's operational performance, aircraft maintenance ==== under ‘airlines-service company’ non-collaborative and collaborative contexts are investigated and formulated. The computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MRO collaboration under outsourcing mode, in view of airline company's overall operational revenue and flexibility while carrying out maintenance routing for individual aircraft in its fleet.","Professionalisation of the aviation industry leads to a rapid expansion of aircraft Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services worldwide, accelerating airline's MRO practice transition. Specifically, outsourcing airline's MRO operations to an independent maintenance service company has become an economical and attractive operating mode (Van den Bergh et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2020), as significant fixed-asset and operational investments on fleet maintenance management are alleviated. Aircraft MRO outsourcing mode enables airline company to focus more on fleet's strategic, tactical and operational commercial service planning, which yield major revenues for airlines (Eltoukhy et al., 2017a). When outsourcing maintenance demands during maintenance planning, airlines expect timely and high service quality, which is determined by the maintenance service company's responsiveness and professionalism. Nevertheless, mismatches between airline's maintenance demands and maintenance company's service level can lead to critical issues, affecting airline's daily commercial operations as well as maintenance company's service and customer satisfaction level (Ertogral and Öztürk, 2019; Dinis et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2017).====Appropriate operational planning strategies for both airline and maintenance service company become significant when establishing a mutually beneficial business mode under MRO outsourcing mode. Without collaborations between airlines and MRO company, conflicts between airline's maintenance planning/demand and maintenance company's service planning/supply usually occur (Qin et al., 2019, 2020a), as these two parties carry out their internally oriented operational plan according to their own needs. As a result, these internal plans usually become unfeasible after the preliminary decision-making stages and require further amendments to obtain a feasible maintenance and service plan. In this regard, to achieve ideal utilisation of transportation and maintenance resources in aviation industry, a cross-organization collaborative mechanism between two major stakeholders, namely airlines and MRO service companies, is indispensable under MRO outsourcing mode.====Within the current maintenance operations practice, mismatches between maintenance demands and maintenance service supply are common, even though airline and maintenance service company carry out and publish relevant schedules several months in advance. Fluctuations of individual aircraft's maintenance timings can occur due to the variations between flight timings and the maintenance service timings. Therefore, the actual maintenance schedule established using actual daily operational level usually deviates from the earlier published schedule, and such phenomes are also present in the maintenance service company, which can suffer from the effects of timing fluctuations at operational levels. Moreover, considering the maintenance resources required for conducting heavy maintenance checks, maintenance company needs to properly organize and utilise maintenance hangar parking space, qualified maintenance technician teams, maintenance components and respective supporting tooling for equipping service capability.====In recent years, researchers have focused on the maintenance planning problems under MRO outsourcing context from both airline company and maintenance service company's perspectives, considering both line maintenance and heavy maintenance check types (Dinis et al., 2019b; Sanchez et al., 2020). For line maintenance, the weekly aircraft maintenance routing problems were studied. It is usually assumed that maintenance service companies and airlines can synchronise their maintenance service supply and maintenance demands, such that the weekly plans can be implemented steadily and repeatedly unless changes in the operation plan occur. For heavy maintenance, airline company has to plan out specific maintenance route for each aircraft with heavy maintenance needs, and publish the relevant maintenance demands in advance for maintenance service company's service planning. Although recent studies investigated the aircraft maintenance planning problems under MRO outsourcing context, studies considering the maintenance planning operation collaboration between two major stakeholders (i.e. airline company and maintenance service company) are quite limited. Moreover, the impacts and benefits of collaboration between the two stakeholders are not yet fully understood. As such, the impacts of collaboration under MRO outsourcing context are addressed in this study, from the perspective of airline company. Specifically, this study aims to comprehend the impact of collaboration in a quantitative manner, by establishing aircraft heavy maintenance routing problem models under MRO outsourcing context; aircraft maintenance routing problem models with and without collaboration are formulated, with the subsequent comparisons, numerical analysis, and managerial insights derivations helping to comprehend the impacts of collaboration of MRO operations. The benefits and expected improvement of operational performance are therefore obtained afterwards.====The rest of this paper is divided into the following sections. Section 2 reviews some recent relative studies on aircraft maintenance under MRO outsourcing context. Section 3 presents the modelling of the proposed aircraft maintenance routing models from airline company's perspective, under non-collaborative and collaborative operations practice. Section 4 explains the computational experiments and numerical analysis on the performance evaluation, as well as impact comprehension of the collaborative MRO operation practice.

Airport operation increases flight routes and improves transport capacity. But airports bring environmental problems, such as noise and carbon dioxide. Building materials of airport architecture and burning fuels of aircraft contribute amounts of carbon dioxide. Given the environmental impact of the aviation industry, a phenomenon described as “flygskam” or flight shame was developed in Europe (Chiambaretto et al., 2021).====Prior research highlighted various factors, which might have an impact on the relationship between the aviation industry and CO==== emissions, such as building materials (Lee et al., 2021, Lee et al., 2021), oil fuels (Hu et al., 2018), technological progress (Turgut et al., 2018) and policy change (Fageda and Teixido, 2022). There is ample evidence to reveal the influence of aviation on carbon emissions at a micro level, while the operation of airports remains an underexplored topic. Motivated by this research gap, we aim to evaluate the impact of airport operations on cities’ carbon emissions. The development of the aviation industry involves two aspects: infrastructure like airport construction, and transportation like airport operation, both of which contribute significant amounts of carbon emissions.====China has been the largest emitter of total carbon emissions since2005,==== in which the aviation industry has also developed dramatically in the last few decades. Since China's first airport was built in 1907, the number of licensed civil aviation airports had reached 241 by the end of 2020. A significant expansion in airport construction is illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Besides the increase in the number and distribution range, the trend of aviation development also thrived. It was expected that by 2025 the number of civil transport airports would reach over 270, with 17 million guaranteed landings and take-offs, 175 billion ton-km of total transport turnover, and 930 million passengers transported. According to the Outline of the National Comprehensive Three-Dimensional Transport Network Plan, there will be 400 civil transport airports by2035.====To identify the effect of airport operation on carbon emissions, this study takes new airport operation as a quasi-natural experiment and uses the Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to examine the causality, based on the empirical evidence from new airport operations in Chinese cities during the period 1999–2017. We divided a sample of cities into two groups: if a city opens and then operates a new airport, it belongs to the treatment group; otherwise, it belongs to the control group.====The change in the control group before and after the new airport operation can be seen as a pure time effect. It is feasible to determine the actual outcome of the airport operation and assess its validity by comparing the differences between the control and treatment groups before and after the airport operation. We also explored the possible underlying mechanism and the city heterogeneity effect.====Two objectives of this study stand out. First, our study provides new evidence by presenting empirical results of the new airport operations’ influence on carbon emissions. Second, our findings can also benefit policymakers in shaping corresponding policy outcomes.====The remainders of this article are as follows. Section Two presents the literature review.

We conduct a spatial statistical analysis of the spatial context relationship using ==== models, and the interaction between the number of airport's on-time flights (OTFs) and flight connectivity. Using 2017 and 2018 data, we characterize the relationship between a European airport's air connectivity index (ACI) and the number of flights that depart or arrive at a gate within 15 min of schedule (OTFs). We also analyze the relationship between OTFs at a given airport and those of neighboring airports. As the distances between airports increase, autocorrelation shifts from a positive to a negative sign meaning that at greater distances, airports' on-time performance is less dissimilar. We find that before the pandemic and the ensuing global travel shutdown, a spatially lagged term of ACI improves the model's ability to account for variations in OTFs across airports. Flight delay propagation in the air transport system caused delays to occur due to the shared resources underlying an initially delayed flight and subsequent flights. This analysis offers a rational for increasing airport connectivity as a way of improving the share of on-time flights of European airports.","Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in the unprecedented decrease in passenger demand together with country-wide flight bans, flight delays were long a source of frustration at major airports worldwide. Delay is defined as the time lapse that occurs when a planned event does not happen at the planned time (====). It can be regarded as a representation of inefficiency or insufficient capacity for transport systems (====). Due to air traffic control capacity and staffing issues, on average, flights in the Middle East were delayed by 29 min, according to a 2015 assessment (====). Scheduled block times have been growing at a speed between 6.9 and 9.2 min per flight from 1986 to 2016 (====). On-time performance (OTP) is the percentage of completed flights that departed the gate within (less than) 15 min of a scheduled gate departure time (====; ====). A flight that departs the gate more than 15 min after the scheduled departure time is a delayed departure (====). Punctuality is a key determinant of passengers' preference for airlines. Having experienced flight delay, passengers are more likely to switch airlines (====; ====).====Airports Council International Europe's monthly Airport Traffic Report classifies passenger traffic and aircraft movements across the European airport network into four different categories, while also measuring the number of flights and available seats to a particular destination (====). It then weights the number of available seats by the size of destination airports in terms of the number of passengers handled each year. These weights reflect both the size and economic importance of destinations and the potential for convenient onward connections (====). Connectivity, which is roughly defined as the degree to which a network node (airport) is connected to the remainder of the network, has acquired widespread acceptance as a crucial concept among transportation policymakers (====). Increased connectivity can create more congestion at the origin airport, which increases the chance for passengers to bear the costs of flight delays. Any disturbance event that occurs at the airport is prone to reactionary or knock-on delays. These knock-on delays have been shown to be responsible for around 45 percent of all flight delays in Europe, and each 1-min primary delay resulted in a reactionary delay of 0.9 min (====).====Due to the economic benefits of air transport, policymakers use connectivity as a planning tool to promote regional development, trade, and tourism. The concept has been utilized in the studies of air transport networks, airline and airport competition, and airspace inefficiencies (====). Within the considerable body of research in the area of identifying and quantifying airport competitiveness determinants, the relationship between an airport's punctual flights and air connectivity has not received much attention. Without appropriate quantitative analysis, airport management practitioners would find it difficult to argue for corrective measures (====). Tobler's 1st law of geography (====) says that: “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” We ask: are the punctuality of the neighboring airports correlated with each airport's own punctuality or air connectivity? We posit that feedback among proximate airports may influence each other's OTFs and air connectivity and aim to address the following questions: Is higher air connectivity a requisite for punctuality, or conversely, does higher air connectivity reduce punctuality? What are the relevant distances of neighboring airports that can provide answers to these questions? How can the spatial lag of ACI contribute to specifying the spread of OTFs beyond what we would anticipate from an airport's air connectivity?====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the literature related to air connectivity and delay propagation for airports. Section three models the number of OTFs as a linear function of air connectivity, followed by a case study that, based on 2017–2018 data, measures spatial association and examines the correlation between on-time flights and air connectivity in Europe. We subsequently discuss the research findings and suggest how to improve the use of air connectivity to predict the number of OTFs.

As the first step, taking the mileage of China's high-speed rail (HSR) as an external variable, a three-stage DEA was employed to obtain the adjusted airport's PTE after eliminating the impact of HSR. As the second step, a single-logarithmic OLS model was used to analyze the influence of the ==== structure on deviations in airports' PTE before and after the adjustment, providing a clear and straightforward basis for formulating and testing policies. The essential findings included the following: (1) the development of HSR mainly inhibited the PTE of most airports due to their competition but also promoted PTE in a few airports for short periods due to their partnership; (2) various factors of the ==== structure had different impacts on the adjusted airport's PTE and determined the trend over time.","Most airports experienced an increase in air passenger transportation until the COVID-19 pandemic severely damaged the travel industry. Many factors may affect the variation in passenger flow in air transit, including the urban economic structure and the HSP effect. Evidence of the reduction in air passenger volume on short- and medium-haul flights within 800–1000 km facing intense competition from HSP has been widely reported in some countries, such as China and Japan (Chen, 2017; Chen and Jiang, 2020; Chen et al., 2020, 2022). Meanwhile, the study of correlations between urban economic structure and air traffic has also been well found in some countries, such as China (Chen et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022). With the development of HSR and the adjustment of the economic structure in a country, the passenger market at its different airports fluctuates over time. Hence, it is urgent to find the optimal dynamic relationship between airport passenger flow, urban economic structure, and the HSR effect, providing authorities with quantitative insights for developing rational strategies to meet the needs in both the short and long term (Güner and Cebeci, 2021; Suzuki et al., 2010).====Airport PTE values can be measured using the DEA approach to calculate the efficiency frontier based on the output level related to passenger flow, considering the available inputs to the urban economic structure (Baltazar and Silva, 2020; Neves et al., 2020). If any two airports are on the efficiency frontier, they have similar inputs; otherwise, the same inputs in an inefficient airport can obtain more outputs. To maximize the efficiency of the air passenger transportation market, airport PTE analysis is used as a diagnostic tool to answer the following questions: (i) are cities managing the inputs used to enlarge airport PTE? (ii) Which are the factors that promote airport PTE? To date, the primary attention has been focused only on the part of the influencing factors, neglecting all factor-specific contributions and their changes in the urban economic structure related to GDP, population, per disposable income, tourism industry, industrial structure, etc. (Chen et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022). Furthermore, existing studies have paid less attention to the positive and negative effects of HSR on airport PTE (if cooperation between HSR and civil aviation happens to increase passenger traffic on flights, the adjusted airport PTE will grow; otherwise, it will drop), resulting in the airport PTE assessed without considering the HSR effect not reflecting the actual situation (Liu et al., 2019, 2021; Li et al., 2019; Dobruszkes et al., 2014). To the best of the authors' knowledge, no comprehensive analysis of the above issues has been reported yet.====The main contribution of this paper was to present a two-step DEA-OLS method by integrating the three-stage DEA model with a single-logarithmic OLS model to reveal and tune off the HSR effect, as an external variable, on airport PTE from the perspective of urban economic structure. The most important tasks of this paper include the following: (1) development of a three-stage DEA (Chen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2020), as the first step, to initially calculate the airport PTE without considering HSR by using the Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC) model (Zhang et al., 2021); then, eliminate the influence of this external variable on this PTE using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) (Chen et al., 2020; Ngo and Tsui, 2022); finally, obtain the adjusted PTE by the repeated application of the BCC model; (2) create a single-logarithmic OLS model (Chen et al., 2021), as the second step, to find how the urban economic structure affects the revised airport PTE; and (3) perform a comparative analysis of the PTE dynamics in individual airports before and after the PTE adjustment, as well as determining the contributions of the remaining factors. Finally, an illustrative case study of nine airports in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China, from 2008 to 2019 was carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed operational framework.====The paper is further structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the methodology of the two-step DEA-OLS method and data preparation. Section 4 analyzes the evolution trends of the PTE of nine airports in China before and after the PTE adjustment.

The results also help the airport-lounge managers in lounge service design, customer segmentation, targeted communication, and customer relationship management.","Airport lounges are an integral part of the airline's customer satisfaction, enabling an airport to differentiate from other airports and get a cutting-edge competitive advantage over the latter (Han et al., 2012; Tsafarakis et al., 2018). Since airline customers pay a hefty amount for the premium seat/class, providing an experiential offering (airport lounge) is critical in developing and maintaining customer relationships (Chua et al., 2017). Although the importance of customer satisfaction of various airlines has been studied in great detail (Park et al., 2005; Akamavi et al., 2015), there need to be more studies on customer satisfaction of airport-lounges. An airport-lounge service offers a place to relax before and after a flight journey, benefiting customers. Apart from airport lounges, airline-specific lounges are also operated by the airlines for their customers only. There could be extended, innovative attributes that could lead to customer satisfaction on airport lounges. For example, airport-lounge facilities include fresh food, Wi-Fi, clean toilets, comfortable seating, shower suits, business centers, premium beverages, and personal assistance which can facilitiate to increase guest volume to the airport lounge (Tam and Lam, 2004).====Airports often face huge losses due to high infrastructure and running costs. In such a situation, the airport's exciting facilities in airport lounges may satisfy the visitors to pass through the airports and fascinate them to recommend these airports to their peers, which may lead to higher revenue generation. However, all the benefits or attributes come with a cost. Therefore, the relative importance of each attribute needs to be examined to use those accordingly and optimize customer satisfaction and subsequently lead to their recommendation behavior. To date, no study has examined the relative importance of the lounge attributes that can augment an airline customer's satisfaction and recommendation behavior. Our study addresses the above-mentioned research gap.====Furthermore, albeit limited, the literature focusing on customer satisfaction and recommendation behavior in airport-lounge has majorly focused on only one country-the USA (Chua et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Chua et al., 2019). However, customers who are visiting these airport-lounges belong to different nationalities. The literature mentions that the service consumer's satisfaction and loyalty vary with context (Lu and Ling, 2008; Messner, 2018). For example, equally satisfied consumers from collectivistic cultures are more likely to provide a positive recommendation than consumers from individualistic cultures (Messner, 2018). Also, the air service customers' expectations vary with their travel class (e.g., Business and Economy Class) (Crotts and Erdmann, 2000). Therefore, it is rational to expect that the relative importance of the lounge service attributes on the satisfaction and recommendation behavior will vary across the cultures and classes of travel. However, to date, no study examines how the relative importance of customer satisfaction and loyalty drivers varies depending on the cultural background or travel class. Our study addresses this research gap.====Grounded on the construal level theory (Trope and Liberman, 2003), this article incorporates the element of cultural differences (power distance,” “uncertainty avoidance,” “individualism/collectivism,” and “masculinity/femininity) proposed by Hofstede in his theory of cross-cultural difference. The study suggests the influence of cultural dimensions on customers' airport lounge satisfaction by considering low vs. high construal. The work also emphasizes the customer's preference for positive ratings and recommendations across cultural differences and construal levels (high vs. low). That said, this study can help airport authorities to provide targeted benefits to various cultural segments of air travelers.====In the next sections, we first discuss the literature gap and the hypotheses. Next, we have discussed the empirical study and the results. In the discussion section, we discussed the implications of the results from both theoretical and practical perspectives, followed by limitations and future scope.",What makes customers of airport lounges satisfied and more?

Iran Aseman Airlines (IAA)is one of the top airlines in Iran that has been able to occupy a significant share of the Iranian aviation market in recent years. In addition to this company, there are other powerful companies that have forced IAA to update the services and improve the quality of services provided to increase customer satisfaction in the existing competitive environment. There is an urgent call for large companies for optimizing resource allocation to enhance customer satisfaction to survive in the business environment. In this study, the most important factors affecting customer satisfaction in Aseman Airlines were identified and ranked by the Best-Worst Method to allocate resources to increase customer satisfaction optimally. Airline's resources were identified in four different categories: class holding, rewarding, human resource allocation, and direct costs to enhance customer satisfaction. According to the weight of the factors considered by customers and the airline's limitations, an Integer Linear Programming Model was developed, and finally, Practical solutions to improve performance were given to senior managers.","In recent years, the popularity of air travel has made the aviation industry an important and influential industry in the world economy and transportation management. Various statistics released by the International Civil Aviation Organization==== show that the aviation industry has been growing on average (Ganiyu, 2017). However, a brief review of the state of this industry in recent years shows that in addition to the progresses made, some problems (e.g., delays in the flight of planes, inappropriate seats, poor service to passengers, etc.) have caused dissatisfaction among passengers, which are the primary customers of this industry (Farooq et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2020). Failure to pay attention to these problems will cause the loss of customers over time.====Customer-centricity and addressing the customer needs are the essential principles of successful organizations and play a decisive role in their growth (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, organizations determine customer priorities and try to realize the most effective ones (Punel et al., 2019) and airlines are no exception to other organizations to survive in a competitive environment and keep their profits high (Stamolampros and Nikolaos, 2019). On the other hand, sensitive customers pay special attention to the quality of the airline's services (Woo, 2019). So, the slightest errors in service delivery have widespread reflections and negative consequences in cyberspace and media. Therefore, considering the existing competitive environment, paying attention to customer needs, and providing quality services are essential to maintain and increase customer satisfaction (Tahanisaz, 2020).====Perceived quality means judging the customer about the importance of the dimensions of brand and preference or superiority that ultimately forces the customer to choose to buy a good service or product, as well as costumer assessment of the overall superiority and preference of a product. Different factors such as the original product offered, convenience and brand image, the service quality and the way the services are delivered to the customer, among others, affect this perception (Solin and Curry, 2022). Nowadays, marketing managers and researchers have found that customer satisfaction directly leads to repeat purchasing and the possibility of increased word-of-mouth advertising (jin et al., 2018). As a result, more attention is paid to customer satisfaction than ever before (Fuchs et al., 2013). Evaluating customer satisfaction based on service quality is one of the most challenging issues in the aviation industry (Law et al., 2022).====Studies show that in today's competitive world, companies' success is related to retaining and maintaining customers and communicating with them. The concept of customer satisfaction plays an important role in the marketing literature. Almost all researchers agree that customer satisfaction is the source of repeated purchases of products and services, verbal advertising, and customer loyalty (Lin et al., 2020).====Satisfaction is a concept that has been widely discussed in the marketing literature and there are several definitions for it. Some of these definitions are as follows: Satisfaction is an emotional response that emphasizes the product's performance during or after consumption against to some set standards (Halstead et al., 1994); Satisfaction is a primary outcome of marketing activity and links processes culminating in purchase and consumption with post purchase phenomena such as attitude change, repeat purchases, and brand loyalty (Churchill and Surprenant, 1982); Customer satisfaction is the customer's overall perception that has been formed over time regarding the product or service (El-Adly, 2019). However, scholars are still looking for a common-sense definition for satisfaction. Oliver (2014) writes that ""everyone knows what satisfaction is, but still seeks to define it. So, no one seems to know what it is.""====In order to meet the predetermined goals and also enhance the customer satisfaction, in the service-oriented organizations, one of the most important challenges that managers of companies face is the issue of how to optimally allocate resources to different parts of the company and to different activities. Therefore, a mechanism must be designed to determine the actual amount of resources required for each activity, and the effect that those resources have on the advancement of a given activity. This way one assures that resources can be optimally allocated to different activities of the organization (Bhatnagar et al., 2008).====In this study, after identifying the factors affecting customer satisfaction and ranking these factors using the best-worst method (BWM) method, the resources of IAA were identified by interviewing the company's managers. Next, according to the ranking of criteria affecting customer satisfaction and the weight of each of these criteria, resources were optimally allocated to activities related to the most important of these criteria.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, a review of the relevant literature is presented. In section 3, the proposed method, which includes three parts, BWM method, the resource allocation and the mathematical model, is developed. Section 4 is dedicated to the numerical results and sensitivity analysis, and, finally, section 5 presents conclusions and future research directions.","Evaluating effective criteria on customer satisfaction using the best-worst method and optimizing resource allocation, case study Iran aseman airlines",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000182,4 March 2023,2023,Research Article,28.0

This study demonstrates that products whose value changes drastically over time could increase the air transport demand. This study represents that the shipper having products with enormous time sensitivity is more willing to endure the higher fare, indicating the possibility that time-sensitive products will drive the air cargo market's growth. This study also provides empirical evidence for the influence of time factors by showing that time-sensitive products are being transferred from sea to air transport based on ICN and South Korean data. The analysis results are as follows. First, an emerging type of cargo, not a traditional type of cargo, has a significant effect on increasing air transport share. The emerging type of items appeared before Covid-19, and Covid-19 has accelerated their growth. Second, even if airfares increase relatively, the proportion of air transportation does not decrease. It seems to be the result that an emerging type of cargo with higher time sensitivity significantly affects the recent increase in air freight volume. Demand increases in an emerging type of cargo, more sensitive to time, can affect the rise in the air transport share, restricting the negative effect from a relative increase in air freight rates. Last, Covid-19 significantly affects the increase in air transport share. In this regard, this study provides practical implications for the recent growth drivers of the air cargo market. Especially in addition to variables traditionally considered to impact air freight volumes, such as income and price, this study suggests changes in transport items as a growth driver for the recent air cargo market.","In recent decades, it seems that the protagonist of the aviation industry has been passengers rather than cargo. According to the World Bank, air freight tonne-kilometers (FTK) grew only about 18%, while the number of passengers carried nearly doubled from 2009 to 2019. In addition, the air cargo business has shown lower profitability than the passenger business from both the airline and airport perspectives (Boeing, 2018). In particular, since passengers spend at duty-free shops and food and beverage outlets, they are more advantageous to increase profits than air freight. This is why the aviation industry pays more attention to the passenger sector by focusing on non-aeronautical revenue (Choi and Park, 2020a).====However, there are signs of change in the air cargo market. The Covid-19 pandemic seems a catalyst for this change. The Covid-19 pandemic severely damaged the global economy. As a result, passenger traffic in 2020 fell by 66% compared to the previous year of 2019, by far the sharpest traffic decline in aviation history (International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2021). But the air cargo market has remained stable (Choi and Park, 2020b). In 2020, FTK declined around 11% year on year, much better than the case of air passengers. In the case of Incheon Airport (ICN) in South Korea, which has handled more than 70 million international passengers annually, the number of passengers decreased by 83% year on year in 2020, but the cargo volume increased by 2%.====This study starts by examining where the recent growth in the air cargo market originates. We aim to raise the question of whether such growth will be a temporary or sustainable trend in the air cargo market. This study focuses on time as a key driver for growth. Many previous studies have also considered ‘time’ as a crucial criterion determining differences in air transportation and other transportation modes (Park et al., 2009; Mitra and Leon, 2014; Demir et al., 2015). This means that time has been one of the dominant paradigms in the air cargo market. Air transport has been the optimized mean of transport to preserve the value of time because of its excellence in delivery speed and punctuality. A significant risk in transporting time-sensitive products is the damage or deterioration of the product (Bemeleit et al., 2005). There is a significant possibility of product damage in the transportation process, such as exposure to ambient air during loading and unloading procedures. According to IATA (2017), about 20% of time-sensitive goods are damaged or discarded due to incomplete supply chain management.====However, developing cold chain technology, equipment advancements such as a “cool dolly”, and cutting-edge logistics facilities reduce the damaged or lost risk of time-sensitive goods during the transporting process. For example, according to Choi and Park (2020a), ICN can reduce the outdoor exposure time by 60% and maximum exposure time by 50% by supplying a cold chain facility in the passenger apron area. Importantly, this contributes to expanding the consumer base of the market by enlarging the transport items or scope of time-sensitive products. It indicates that the expansion of time-sensitive transport items can significantly affect the recent increase in air cargo volume. Therefore, this study designs an empirical model to identify the growth drivers of the air cargo market, focusing on the expansion of time-sensitive items based on empirical data from ICN and South Korea. This study hypothesizes that an emerging type of cargo with more time-sensitive characteristics than a traditional type of cargo would drive air cargo volume growth. In addition, we assume that the increase in the air transportation share means the air cargo market's growth. Through this, this study determines which type of cargo, between traditional and emerging cargo, has a more significant impact on the air cargo market's growth.====The rest of our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly overviews of the air cargo market in recent years. Next, we discuss the theoretical and empirical approaches to exploring how the time factor affects this market. Section 4 presents an empirical strategy and analysis results to analyze the impact of the expansion of time-sensitive items on the air cargo market's growth.

However, in addition to the safe design of vehicles, efficient operation must also be achieved by matching passenger requests to unoccupied and suitable vehicles. In the agent-based transportation simulation MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation), a rule-based approach has been followed by assigning the nearest available vehicle to each passenger request. Sophisticated considerations such as pooling multiple passengers with identical trip requests in terms of time and location or the urgency of a request were only partially considered or not considered at all. To decrease operating costs, especially by reducing the number of passenger flights and avoiding relocation flights, appropriate dispatching is essential for efficient assignment of available vehicles to trip requests. For this purpose, the suitability of the Bipartite Matching Dispatcher (BMD), already proven for ground-based on-demand mobility concepts, was investigated for application to UAM systems by demonstrating its performance on an existing data set using a mock-up simulation and comparing it to the initial dispatcher in MATSim. Studies have not only shown the similarity between UAM and ground-based on-demand operations, but also the compatibility of BMD for high load traffic scenarios with undersized fleets. Insights on the impact of available information, for example, the prioritization of early-submitted requests over urgent requests, on the operator’s point of view can be concluded. For an efficient vehicle assignment, the consideration of passengers’ attitude towards possible comfort restrictions due to longer waiting times and incentives through price adjustments is of crucial importance.","Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is the idea of safe and efficient air traffic operation in metropolitan areas for human-crewed or autonomous aircraft transportation systems (Thipphavong et al., 2018). In addition to improving access to mobility in region underserved by existing transportation infrastructure, the concept is intended to bring fast, silent and affordable transportation to highly congested urban and suburban areas (Rothfeld et al., 2020b). Although small passenger-carrying air vehicles have been discussed since the fifties, they have recently received more attention due to the advancement of power and propulsion systems (Bacchini and Cestino, 2019). Advantages over conventional helicopters are quieter operation, increased safety, reduced maintenance, and higher energy efficiency (Rothfeld et al., 2020b, Uber Elevate, 2016). These improvements are achieved primarily through electrification (Uber Elevate, 2016), accordingly such concepts are also referred to as electrified Vertical Take-off and Landing Vehicles (eVTOLs). In the long run, VTOLs are expected to become exclusively autonomous, which further decreases operational cost (Straubinger et al., 2020, Uber Elevate, 2016).====Current transportation services, such as in São Paul (Brazil), offer on-demand rides by allowing passengers to book helicopter flights via mobile applications (Rothfeld et al., 2020b). Mobility-on-Demand (MOD) is considered the dominant mode of operation, as opposed to conventional schedule-based operation. To gain insights into demand patterns and potential challenges during UAM operation, researchers conducted studies for VTOL-based MOD services by developing and deploying an extension for the multi-agent transportation simulation framework MATSim (Horni et al., 2016, Balać et al., 2019, Plötner et al., 2020) and analyzed potential time savings achieved by UAM trips compared to ground-based transportation systems (Rothfeld et al., 2020a). This MATSim-UAM extension includes a simple rule-based dispatcher for VTOL vehicles that follows a myopic decision logic and therefore does not necessarily assign vehicles to trip requests in the most efficient way (Rothfeld et al., 2018a). However, efficient dispatching strategies are essential to keep the number of VTOL vehicles needed and the total energy consumption low while maintaining high quality of service, e.g., low waiting times for customers, as dispatching logic significantly affects vehicle availability across the network depending on fleet size.====Dispatching policies are often based on heuristics, i.e., they follow a sequential algorithm to determine feasible matches between requests and vehicles (Vazifeh et al., 2018, Gendreau and Potvin, 1998). Rule-based heuristic decision-making requires little computational effort, but does not necessarily lead to a high-quality solution. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model-based dispatcher has a well-defined objective function, and the branch-and-bound algorithm – as a common solution algorithm for this type of problem – allows comparison of solutions to their theoretical optimum. However, such optimal solution algorithms are usually more computationally intensive and this additional computational effort often hinders their applicability in real-time operational scenarios. Whether good or even optimal solutions are available depends on the model structure and model size. Solution speed also depends on the heuristics included in the pre-solution procedures of MIP solvers, with some performing better than others on different problem types (Folkestad et al., 2020).====Optimal assignment algorithms are preferred when the problem size is small enough for the computational effort to be reasonable. The problem size depends on the number of open requests and the size of the vehicle fleet. Since UAM will most probably serve significantly fewer passengers than ground-based transportation (Balać et al., 2019), there is reason to believe that exact solution methods are computationally feasible. Although the computation time of exact approaches is too slow for real-time operations, a proven optimal solution can serve as a baseline compared to heuristic approaches. However, solutions can only be found within their planning horizon and the available information of the planning scenario. In an online setting, for instance, not all information is available at the beginning of operations, i.e., a previously optimal solution may become suboptimal if spontaneous requests arise in the meantime. The lack of complete knowledge limits the theoretical performance of exact solution approaches, though not more than it also impedes heuristic approaches (Maciejewski, 2014).====With this in mind, this paper aims to analyze the impact of the chosen dispatching logic on the UAM fleet performance, assuming that a suitable dispatching algorithm is identified and implemented in the simulation. This online dispatcher is expected to outperform the existing rule-based dispatcher in MATSim-UAM in terms of passenger waiting times and required relocation for a given demand scenario. With a state-of-the-art algorithm, MATSim-UAM can provide more convincing results about the potential performance of a UAM transportation system. Findings from this paper can also be incorporated into the open-source MATSim project. Using a stand-alone simulation environment following MATSim-UAM, this research will then investigate whether the rule-based dispatcher in MATSim-UAM could benefit from a MIP approach.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: First, a literature review of related research on ground-based fleet dispatch in Section 2 provides insights into existing optimization models that will serve as a template for developing a suitable online dispatcher for UAM transportation systems. Subsequently, the main features of the optimization problem and the modified optimization model based on the Bipartite Matching Dispatcher (BMD) are introduced, specifying the objective function and constraints (Section 3). Section 4 introduces the agent-based transportation simulation framework MATSim and the approach to apply the online dispatcher. Finally, comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of dispatching behavior in different scenarios of UAM fleet operations (Section 5).

"Yu Ming-Miin,Rakshit Ipsita","Department of Transportation Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, 202-24, Taiwan, ROC","Received 18 October 2022, Revised 18 January 2023, Accepted 27 January 2023, Available online 13 February 2023, Version of Record 13 February 2023.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2023.102376,Cited by (2),Long-term sustainability in airline transportation entails mitigating the detrimental impact of CO,"Air travel, which is swift, simple, and expensive, along with its role in the creation of jobs and wealth in today's globe, plays a crucial part in the communication and development of civilizations. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that in 2017, aviation supported 58 million jobs and $2.4 trillion in GDP, and that number is predicted to rise to 105 million jobs and $6 trillion by 2034. As of 2022, the value of air freight globally accounts for nearly 35% of the total value of commodities.====Enhancing the performance and organisation management becomes relevant for airlines to sustain and grow in the continuously changing milieu (Shirazi and Mohammadi, 2019). This can be undertaken by either assessing the relative efficiency of the airline under study or by computing the efficient projection/benchmark utilising the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method under the non-parametric approach. In the case of the latter, benchmark targets for inputs and outputs that are obtained from DEA models implicitly show the maximum possible improvement that an observed decision making unit (DMU) can attain to become efficient. However, these targets might be very far from the observed DMU and would appear to be ambitious (Lozano et al., 2019). To overcome this, several methods, such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming, Bilevel Linear Programming, etc., have been suggested in the literature that estimates the least distance to the efficient frontier (Aparicio et al., 2007, 2017; Fukuyama et al., 2014). Lozano et al. (2019) follow an alternative approach by assessing the DEA targets from the point of view of bargaining problems. Under this approach, the input and output targets are obtained by means of a process of bargaining between different inputs and outputs, wherein the observed values are used as the disagreement point. Hence, this approach calculates the target from below that is brought about by the intercession of various inputs and outputs instead of from above as is carried out under the overall projection approach. The overall projection approach entails globally determining the input and output targets from a system perspective (Lozano et al., 2019). Following the bargaining approach, it is possible to obtain a more reasonable and optimal combination of inputs and outputs as compared to traditional DEA benchmark methods. Hence, the determination and effective execution of transportation policies can benefit greatly from the computation of input and output targets.====Challenges such as carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions, noise pollution, labour discrimination, and water usage (to clean the engines) to name a few, exist in the aviation industry and, thus, form a part of the industry's agenda in order to move towards sustainability. However, CO==== emissions from the airline industry have become one of the major issues in recent years. According to IATA, air transport accounts for around 2–3% of global carbon emissions each year. Without the mitigation measures, it is expected to be around 400–600% higher in 2050 compared to 2010 levels, as per the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) 2010 report. Hence, relevant steps are necessary to be undertaken so as to mitigate the detrimental impact on the environment and achieve long-term sustainability. Various measures have been implemented globally in this regard. For instance, in 2008, it was decided by the European Union (EU) that international aviation operations would be incorporated into the EU Emissions Trading System. In 2016, the adoption of the “Carbon Neutral Growth from 2020″ resolution by the 39th Session of the ICAO in Montreal put in place a series of industry-specific market-based emission reduction instruments that include taxes, emissions trading systems, carbon offsets, etc. Furthermore, numerous airlines have put in place policies like Singapore Airlines' Aspire program, Air Portugal's CO==== emissions offset program, and Delta's carbon emissions policy to control emissions. Most recently, the EU is planning to implement the carbon border tax, Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), by 2026 and achieve the twin objectives of repayment of €750 billion in pandemic recovery debt and aid in meeting the target of decreasing the average EU CO==== emissions by 55 percent in 2030, compared to 1990 levels.====The mitigation of CO==== emissions is costly and complex. Characterised by high asset intensity and low profitability, reducing CO==== emissions would entail the curtailment of the production of the desirable output. Hence, to overcome these limitations, it becomes necessary to reach the optimal level of CO==== emissions by way of reaching an agreement between inputs, good outputs, and CO==== emissions. This would serve the twin objectives of improving the efficiency of the inputs and outputs as well as the environmental performance. In the case of airlines where good outputs are yielded along with bad output (that is, CO==== emissions), it becomes crucial to scale down the production of CO==== emissions to boost airlines' performance. It would ensure the long-term sustainability of airlines' transportation by mitigating the detrimental impact of CO==== emissions on the environment without affecting the performance of airlines. However, the DEA bargaining approach proposed by Lozano et al. (2019) would only technically compute a projection for the observed input and good output and not for the bad output on the benchmark frontier. In the case where the total amount of variables corresponding to all units in the sample is fixed, it does not make sense to increase the sum of targets beyond a fixed total. Lozano (2023) considers undesirable outputs in the recently proposed DEA Nash Bargaining approach, albeit, in a fixed-sum variables context. The difference between Lozano (2023) and Lozano et al. (2019) lie in the fact that the former jointly projects the DMUs because of the fixed-sum restrictions whereas the latter solves a particular bargaining problem for projecting individual DMU. Since this study is based on a sample of international airlines, there are no cases where the total number of variables corresponding to all units in the sample is fixed. Hence, the innovation of this paper is the introduction of a DEA bargaining model with undesirable outputs to calculate the efficient target for each DMU separately. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has computed input and output targets using the bargaining approach in the case of airlines. Hence, a modified DEA bargaining model that includes handling of undesirable output needs to be developed in the context of airlines.====The key questions then the current study attempts to answer encompass the following: Keeping in view with the goal to attain sustainability, how can a bargaining model be formulated to assess airlines' environmental performance? How can reasonable and optimal targets for airlines be obtained from an unbiased, rational negotiation between the inputs, desirable, and undesirable outputs? By addressing these questions, the present study contributes in the following ways. Firstly, a DEA bargaining model, particularly the Nash bargaining model, will be presented that would, for the first time to the best of the authors’ knowledge, consider the weak disposability of undesirable output to obtain the input-output targets in the case of airlines. Secondly, the undesirable output will be modelled in such a way that the abatement factor is non-uniform. This incorporation of the non-uniform abatement factor of bad output has been carried out for the first time to compute input and output targets. In contrast to the situation where all the airlines apply uniform abatement factors, the non-uniform abatement factor helps to undertake cost-effectiveness in abating CO==== emissions in those airlines that display the lowest costs of marginal abatement (Kuosmanen, 2005). To this end, this paper extends the approach proposed by Lozano et al. (2019) and applies it empirically to airlines. The advantages of this approach are that it is able to compute reasonable and optimal targets and also incorporate undesirable output along with the desirable ones while obtaining the input-output targets. In addition, the Nash bargaining solution is the only bargaining solution which fulfils the four axioms namely Pareto efficiency, symmetry, scale invariance, and independence of irrelevant alternatives (Lozano et al., 2019). Unlike other linear bargaining models (Kalai–Smorodinsky, weighted egalitarian, normalised utilitarian, etc.), the Nash bargaining model is a nonlinear target setting model consisting of a nonlinear objective function and linear constraints that pose less computational complexities. However, because the Nash bargaining model is the only bargaining solution which fulfils the four axioms within the class of bargaining problems having a convex, compact, and comprehensive bargaining set, this study uses the Nash bargaining model as the research method.==== Hence, the outcome of the study would enrich the literature to obtain insightful suggestions that would help enhance the performance of airlines.====The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the review of the existing literature has been undertaken. In Section 3, the Nash bargaining model based on weakly disposable technology is described. Section 4 shows the data descriptions.

In order to fill the gap in the research of GSE scheduling problem with mixed fleet of fuel vehicles and electric vehicles, this paper establishes a mixed operation model of fuel and electric vehicles with time window with the objective function of minimizing the sum of time cost, energy cost and emission cost, and considers the energy consumption of a new type of electric aircraft towing tractor which have APU substitution function. Then solve it by using a reliable adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm, which improves the quality of the solution through the simulated annealing principle and expansion of the applicability of the adaptive mechanism. Furthermore, 2 scenarios with different characteristics of ==== scale, the terminal configuration and flight were constructed on the basis of Nanjing Lukou international airport data, and each scenario have 5 different proportions of fleets in order to reflect the operation characteristics along with the change of electric vehicles proportion. The results show that: (1) Scenario characteristics will affect the optimal fleet allocation strategy; (2) Compared with large airports, small airports have higher emission reduction efficiency and lower energy saving efficiency; (3) Airport ground electrification increases flight delays, especially at smaller airports with a more inflexible network. This study can provide data reference for the optimal fleet configuration in airports with mixed operation with fuel and electric vehicles.","In recent years, the problem of global warming caused by large-scale emissions of greenhouse gases has become more and more serious, and the issue of carbon dioxide emission reduction has received widespread international attention. For the air transport industry, the ICAO pushed back the CORSIA in 2016, which sets targets for global aviation to be ""peak carbon"" by 2035 and ""carbon neutral"" by 2050, with an expected stabilization of net emissions from global aviation at 580 million tons. Therefore, many countries are under tremendous pressure to reduce its carbon emissions as the demand for air transportation continues to grow, so reducing carbon emissions from airports has been an essential task for airports in recent years. Airport ground support equipment (GSE) is one of the main sources of carbon emissions, consuming about 13% of the total airport energy consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel (Yu, J., 2017) and about 15% of the total airport carbon emissions. Therefore, many countries are introducing more electric GSE at airports. For example, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has promulgated several policies to replace fuel vehicles with electric vehicles at airports gradually. In 2015, a unique pilot project was pushed back to convert aviation ground equipment from oil to electricity. In the ""Three-Year Action Plan for Winning the Blue Sky"" issued in 2018, a detailed implementation plan was proposed for the introduction of electric tractors, platform tractors, ferries, passenger lift tractors and baggage tractors in airports. By the end of 2021, 5% of airports have completed the process of vehicle electrification, 75% of airports are accelerating the implementation of pure electric vehicle replacement programs. The total number of pure electric vehicles in all airports is close to 20,000, with 3600 recharging posts and over 30% of electric vehicles. However, most airports are still in the mixed operation stage of fuel and electric vehicles. How to scientifically allocate different types of vehicles and develop a dispatch plan for mixed vehicles has become a major problem for airports.====In order to improve the efficiency of airport vehicle service and reduce pollution emissions, scholars have conducted in-depth research on airport GSE scheduling methods. For a single kind of GSE scheduling problem, the shortest total travel distance(Norin et al., 2012), the least operating cost (Du et al., 2014) or the most minor delay (Xin et al., 2020) are generally taken as the objective functions, and a vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is established, which is usually designed as a heuristic (Fan, 2009) or an exact solution algorithm (Diepen et al., 2009) to perform the solution. The main research objects are pure fuel fleet (Du et al., 2014) or pure electric fleet (Brevoord, 2021; Van Baaren, 2019), such as solving the scheduling problem of pure fuel passenger lift tractor by genetic algorithm (GA) (Xin et al., 2020) and solving the scheduling problem of pure electric aircraft tractor by branch-and-bound algorithm (Brevoord, 2021). The above research results are not fully applicable to the mixed operation environment of fuel and electric vehicles. The mixed vehicle path problem faces the difficulties of complex vehicle energy consumption and the difficulty of ignoring the recharging process of electric vehicles, so more constraints need to be considered in the modelling process, which also brings difficulty to the model solution. The adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS)algorithm is commonly used as one of the heuristic algorithms to solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP) (Alinaghian and Shokouhi, 2018; Avci and Avci, 2019; Liu and Jiang, 2019) and the electric vehicle routing problem (E-VRP) (Keskin and Çatay, 2016). However, the traditional ALNS algorithm is difficult to achieve a balance between solution time and solution accuracy because the mixed fleet operation model with both fuel and electric vehicle s take into account more constraints. GSE usually need to obtain the optimal solution in a shorter time, so the time and accuracy of the solution process are more demanding, and a faster and more accurate algorithm needs to be designed to solve this problem.====On the other hand, electrified GSE is different from normal electric vehicles. Under normal circumstances, normal electric vehicles only need to consider the power consumption during the travel process, but since electric support vehicles have their specific services function, they need to consider the power consumption during the service process. Due to the policies promotion, pure electric tractors have been the major objects to be introduced and developed, gradually replacing conventional tractors. A pure electric tractor has been developed with a power supply function, which can replace the aircraft APU to provide power for the aircraft's air conditioning system, on-board systems system and engine starter in addition to providing aircraft push-back services. We chose this new aircraft tractor in a fleet with conventional fuel-consumed tractors for our study mainly because this tractor is the most power-consuming and has the most complex energy consumption model among all types of electric GSE, while the hybrid-electric vehicles are not considered because they are less energy efficient. The vehicle energy consumption determines the cost of electricity on the one hand and the travel distance on the other. The traditional energy consumption model (Brevoord, 2021), which assumes a linear relationship between electricity and travel distance, cannot accurately reflect the energy consumption process of this type of tractor, so a new energy consumption model needs to be established and applied to this type of vehicle to achieve an accurate measurement of vehicle operating costs.====The main contributions of this paper are reflected in the following aspects: first, it establishes a complex energy consumption model that integrates the energy consumption of travelling, towing and power supply of electric towing tractors (ETTs), and constructs a mixed fleet dispatching model of conventional towing tractors (CTTs) and ETTs with the objective of minimizing the sum of time cost, energy cost and emission cost, and with the planned push-back service time window and ETT power as constraints. Second, an improved ALNS algorithm that evaluates infeasible solutions by adding a penalty function and accepts infeasible solutions with certain probability based on a simulated annealing (SA) criterion, thus improving the speed and accuracy of the algorithm. Third, the model is applied to two different scenarios to evaluate the effects of flight size and stand on the dispatching results, as well as the degree of differences in operating costs, delays, and other indicators under different vehicle allocation structures.====This paper is organized as follows: section II reviews the relevant literature; section III describes the problem and develops a mixed integer model for mixed fleet path planning; section IV designs the algorithm for the model solution; section V presents the parameter settings for two scenarios and analyzes and evaluates the computational results; section VI concludes the whole paper.",Mixed fleet scheduling method for airport ground service vehicles under the trend of electrification,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000224,11 February 2023,2023,Research Article,32.0

The impacts of airport efficiency on bilateral passenger traffic and freight volume are then assessed by developing a novel robust gravity model incorporating multilateral resistance (MR) terms and the Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) method to address heteroscedasticity. We collected air route data using Incheon airport with a sample of 50 airports in 28 countries for 2006–2015. The results from all the applied models revealed a significant and positive effect of airport efficiency on passenger traffic and freight volume.,"Today, as the aviation industry has developed rapidly, new demands for air traffic have emerged. Increasing international collaboration and growth of e-commerce and high value-added product have accelerated the increase of air passenger traffic and freight volume. The improving living standards worldwide and growing the middle class in developing countries are also crucial factors boosting the growth of aviation industry (Zhang and Zhang, 2016). The total number of air passengers carried on scheduled services increased by 7.2% from 3.8 billion in 2016 to 4.1 billion in 2017 (ICAO International Civil Aviation Organization, 2018) and the global air freight measured in freight ton kilometers increased by 9.0% from 2016 to 2017 year (IATA International Air Transport Association, 2018). Therefore, many airports are now suffering from severe congestions such as delay at airport and these congestions have become a major problem worldwide (Rupp, 2009; Santos and Robin, 2010). To solve these congestions and accommodate increasing air traffic, many countries in the world are striving to develop their airport by expanding airport facilities and making the airport more efficient.====Since expanding airport facilities needs a huge amount of money and long time, governments and airport authorities have focused on enhancing the airport efficiency. The increase of airport efficiency will bring cost and time reduction for both airport and its users. Or increased airport efficiency can solve some congestions and, in turn, enhance the service qualities which customers experience. In these ways, the cost and time reductions and enhanced customer satisfaction ultimately can make a bigger passenger traffic and freight volume. Also, cost reductions in terms of airports caused from the increased efficiency allow the airports to establish a competitive price policy to attract bigger air traffics. However, the relationship between airport's efficiency and air traffics is not investigated yet. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to empirically measure the impact of airport's efficiency on both passenger traffics and freight volume.====Numerous studies have assessed the impact of transport infrastructure performance on bilateral passenger and cargo traffic (Sánchez et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 2005; Blonigen and Wilson, 2008; Márquez-Ramos et al., 2011; Portugal-Perez and Wilson, 2012; Hausman et al., 2013; Bensassi et al., 2015; Bottasso et al., 2018). Efficiency literature, however, points out that most efficiency studies are biased, mainly due to sampling problems, implying that those studies on airport efficiency are not an exception (Simar and Wilson 1998, 2000). Moreover, the international trade literature also mentions other types of serious biases in extant studies.====The typical methodologies used to measure the efficiency and bilateral trade are data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the gravity model, respectively. DEA literature reveals an inherent bias of efficiency score caused by the data sampling process (Simar and Wilson, 1998, 2000). The data sampling bias lies in the presumption or research practice that the collected sample represents a population. In the air transport management field, there have also been numerous DEA studies that examine airport's efficiency without consideration for the sampling bias. Because the ignorance of this bias can expose stakeholders to wrong information about benchmark points and cause wrong investments, correcting these biases in the methodology is important. Further detail/corroboration on this shortcoming is provided below in the literature and methodology sections. The international trade literature shows that numerous studies using gravity models are biased due to the neglect of multilateral resistance (MR) or heteroscedasticity problems, or both (McCallum, 1995; Anderson and Van Wincoop, 2003; Silva and Tenreyro, 2006). The application of a biased regression model can cause serious biases in the estimation and, in turn, offer wrong implications to the industry and stakeholders such as policy makers. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted yet to examine the impact of airport efficiency on air freight volume and passenger traffic with a robust methodology. Even the numerous existing studies on airport efficiency or international trade are deemed to be not free from the biases mentioned above.====Our research makes the following contributions. First, this research is the first of its kind to investigate the impact of airport efficiency on both air passenger traffic and air freight volume using empirical data. Since there only have been qualitative studies investigating the relationship between airport efficiency and bilateral trade, it is important to empirically measure the sign and magnitude of impact of environment variable on air traffics. To address the impact of airport efficiency on bilateral trade and passenger flow, this study develops testing models at two stages. In the first stage, airport efficiency from 2006 to 2015 is analyzed using the bootstrapping SBM-DEA model. In the second stage, the impact of airport efficiency on the air passenger traffic and freight volume is examined by including the airport efficiency analyzed in the first stage into the gravity model.====Second, this research employed novel and robust models to estimate the impact of airport efficiency on air passengers and freight. Since the application of biased methodology can offer wrong signals to the air market and stakeholders, it is crucial to adopt robust models. We correct the sampling bias of DEA by combining SBM-DEA models with the bootstrapping technique. We solve the infeasible problems arising when combining the SBM-DEA models with subsample-based bootstrapping technique by applying the super-efficiency model approach. Also, this is the first study to apply a technical rule for selecting a sub-sample size when conducting empirical bootstrapped DEA. Finally, to eliminate inherent biases in the gravity model, we adopt the MR term and Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) method while controlling for other variables, including macroeconomic factors and aviation demand-related factors found in the literature. By eliminating the biases in the methodology, we expect that this model can estimate the impact of airport efficiency on air passengers and freight precisely and in turn, offer correct field information to stakeholders such as airport, its users, and policy makers.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The following section reviews the literature on airport efficiency and bilateral trade. Section 3 explains the methodology and section 4 presents the dataset and results. Finally, section 5 concludes and states the limitations of this study with a view to suggesting areas worthy of further research.","The effect of airport efficiency on air traffic, using DEA and multilateral resistance terms gravity models",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699723000078,11 February 2023,2023,Research Article,33.0

It is also a formidable challenge for economic reform and transformation. Since the reform and opening up in 1978, the gap in the level of development between the eastern and western regions has increased. Benefiting from a location closer to overseas markets and the preference policy implemented earlier as an experiment,==== the eastern region has a level of economic development that gradually exceeded that of the central and western areas. At the same time, the gap between the northern and southern regions has become a new manifestation of regional imbalance in China. Shanxi was the only northern province included in the top 10 for economic growth at the province level in 2018, while the bottom five are all located in the north. By 2021, the 10 provinces with the lowest growth rate were in the north. One focus of China's current economic development strategy is on solving the problem of unbalanced regional development. This can be seen in the report of the 19th National Congress of the CPC in 2017, which expressly referred to efforts to implement a system of harmonious regional development. In 2021, the Central Economic Work Conference stressed that the government should further implement a strategy of coordinated regional development designed to promote the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions. At this time, China has completed the historic task of building a moderately prosperous society and is prepared to enter a new stage of building a modern socialist country. With that objective, coordinated regional development will be a critical factor in the effort.====Since the 1990s, the construction of transportation infrastructure has expanded rapidly and played an essential role in the growth of China's economy. This has involved investment in a transportation infrastructure network that covers almost the whole country, and airports have been an essential part of this development. As a result, both the quantity and scale of civil airports have expanded rapidly. Between 1990 and 2020, 243 airports in 207 administrative regions were built at the prefecture level, which is 62% of the total,==== covering most cities in China (Fig. 1). Notably, the areas with new airports include cities on the east coast and many cities in the central and western regions.====Furthermore, high-speed railway (HSR) and expressways have been built in remote regions under the national strategy of picking up speed and forming a network of ground transport that can become a substitute for airport transport. Therefore, it seems that little effort is being made to construct airports in these regions. However, according to airport statistics, the largest number of airports in China are in Xinjiang (21), Inner Mongolia (19), Sichuan (15), Yunnan (15), and Heilongjiang (13) Provinces. Most of these airports were built in recent years, even though these central and western provinces have high proportions of poverty-stricken counties. Why do the local governments devote themselves to airport construction? Does it have a positive effect on the local economy? These questions provide a foundation to explore the relationship and mechanisms linking airport construction and regional economic disparities.====Academics have focused on theoretically and empirically exploring the relationship between transportation infrastructure and China's economic development against the background of rapid expansion of transportation construction in the country. Some studies found that the transportation infrastructure network significantly boosted China's economic growth (Charles et al., 2006). Other studies pointed out that poor infrastructure in poor regions was an important reason for widening regional disparities (Démurger, 2001; Banerjee et al., 2012). Most studies have acknowledged that transportation infrastructure is a critical factor in economic growth; backward regions can achieve great strides in development and even catch up by vigorously developing such projects. Given China's regional disparities, we were interested in whether the rapid expansion of airports has narrowed the economic gap in different areas in recent years.====We regarded airport construction in China as a quasi-natural experiment to study the effect and mechanism of airport infrastructure on regional economic disparities by the difference-in-differences method. We collected a long-term dataset of airport construction and economic development in 289 cities from 1994 to 2018 and subjected it to an empirical test. The results show that airport construction reduced regional economic disparities in China. Further, the heterogeneity test shows that airport construction in eastern, central, and northern cities reduced disparities in nearby cities compared to the national level. At the same time, the effect is limited to the interior of western region. Few relationships were found between airport size and regional disparities. However, we find that only medium-size airports reduce regional economic gaps. Moreover, we found that the effect of airports on regional economic gaps became apparent after the airport localization reform in 2003. Finally, we identified the mechanism in capital allocation, which reveals that regional gaps were reduced by increasing the attraction of local investment sourced from airport construction, which improved the investment environment, particularly under the positive policy shock of airport localization reform.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The second part summarizes the literature review. The third part describes the institutional background and theoretical hypothesis. The fourth part provides the methodology and data sources. The fifth part describes the benchmark and heterogeneity test.

Evaluating services in these areas will help identify gaps that need to be closed to improve passenger experience. As an ideal connection point for passengers flying to Europe from East Asia, Urumqi Airport has been approved as an international hub at North west of China. This paper investigates the airport's facilities and services and assess how to develop it into a passenger-centered airport. A questionnaire survey is conducted concerning airport departure, arrival and transfer services. The cloud model is used to evaluate service satisfaction and the extended contributive rule (ECR) method is used to determine the degree of importance of each service item. Results show that passengers have great concerns over the safety, baggage and flight delay services. Services for catering, shopping, airport traffic, flight delay, and Internet need to be improved, among which catering, shopping and flight delay services need to be given priority. The overall satisfaction for Terminal 1 is lower than Terminals 2 and 3.","Outstanding service level has been acknowledged as a key factor for airports to increase their competitive advantages, in terms of achieving higher operating efficiency and attracting more passengers (Allen et al., 2021; Kramer et al., 2013). Hence, it is essential to understand passengers' satisfaction on an airport's service from a systematic perspective. The evaluation of passenger satisfaction level has become an important issue in airport operation and management, and has also been systematically surveyed by airport operators, international agencies and other organizations (Bezerra and Gomes, 2016). However, Wiredja et al. (2019) pointed out most research on airport service performance pays close attention to the departing passengers, only limited research has focused on arrival and transfer passengers or the complete passenger activities in the terminals (Park and Jung, 2011; Chao et al., 2013; Wiredja, 2017). This limitation results in the unbalanced and biased recognition of passengers' perception and evaluation on airport service. This research addresses this literature gap by investigating the airport service performance covering the areas of departure, arrival, and transfer in the terminals.====Customer satisfaction is a post-consumer response, which reflects the overall feelings of like or dislike after the consuming behaviors (Oliver, 1980; Athanassopoulos et al., 2001). Customers will feel satisfied if the actual performance outcomes meet or exceed their expectation, otherwise, they will feel dissatisfied (Falk et al., 2010). Therefore, satisfaction with the same product varies from person to person. In the process of satisfaction evaluation, the selection of satisfaction indicators should be carried out according to specific circumstances.====In order to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, this paper takes Urumqi Airport as an example to investigate the airport's landside facilities and services in departure, arrival, and transfer domains, and assess how to develop it into a passenger-centered airport. Urumqi is the capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, an important point in the Silk Road Economic Belt, and an ideal connection point for passengers flying to Europe from East Asia. Urumqi Airport is located in the northwest suburbs of Urumqi, 16.8 km away from the urban area of the city. It has 3 terminals and one runway, handling 24 million passengers and 170,000 tonnes of cargo and mail in 2019. Statistics from Xinjiang Airport Group show that in 2018 and 2019, the number of transfer passengers at Urumqi Airport exceeded 2 million, and the transfer ratio in 2019 reached 8.5%, an increase of 3.5 percentage points from 2015. And in recent years, Urumqi Airport is accelerating the construction of the transfer system, optimizing the transfer process, shortening the MCT time, and improving the transfer service experience.====This research first builds a satisfaction evaluation indictor system through literature review. A survey is then conducted to collect the passengers' judgment on their satisfaction and perceived importance level of airport services. The cloud model is used to evaluate the satisfaction of airport services. The model results can reveal the degree of dispersion and distribution range of the evaluation data to reflect passengers' heterogeneity in the evaluation process. Due to the heterogeneity of passenger's personal attributes and travel attributes, the extended contributive rule (ECR) method is used to determine the degree of importance of each service item. And the satisfaction and importance evaluation results are finally combined to determine the services that need to be improved first. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that applies these two approaches in the evaluation of service satisfaction in air transport. This study will serve as a useful guidance and reference for air transport service evaluation that wish to capture the heterogeneity of the evaluation results.====The reminder of the paper is organized as below.

A novel domain-knowledge driven topic (DDT) model is proposed to explore the embedded patterns and hidden connections in ATC incident reports. Seventeen-year ATC incident records are collected from Local Air Traffic Management Branch of ==== Administration of China to illustrate the procedure. First, a total of twenty topics are identified from the collected reports, including aircraft-flight-operation related topics, crew-activities related topics, airspace-control-transfer related topics and others. Then, the topic evolution trend over years is explored, which identifies four hot topics and four cold topics over the study period. The results reveal that in general the contributing factors of ATC incidents are gradually shifting from external factors (e.g., radar equipment or aircraft components) to human related factors (e.g., instruction communication or handover of airspace control) due to the improved quality of communication equipment and some adjustments of ATC rules over the past two decades. Finally, the topic evolution analyses across different ATC areas and flight phases are further conducted. The findings indicate that the potential causes of ATC incidents are different across various ATC areas and flight phases due to the variation in geographical environment and local policies. The results of this research can help local ATC authorities conduct efficient safety performance assessment, implement proactive countermeasures for specific areas to enhance air traffic safety, and provide aviation authorities with insightful suggestions for ATC process optimization and design.","Unsafe air traffic control (ATC) operations have been recognized as one of the major contributors to increase the accident rate in civil aviation, resulting in reduced air transportation efficiency and safety performance (Andersen and Bove, 2000; Olsen, 2011; Mosier et al., 2013; Leonhardt, 2016; Olsen and Williamson, 2017; Kuhn, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Boyd et al., 2021). Over the past two decades, the number of ATC incidents in China has increased dramatically, arousing great public concerns about civil aviation safety (CAAC, 2021). Aiming to understand the occurrence mechanism and main causes of ATC incidents, over the past two decades a surge of studies have attempted to explore the embedded patterns and hidden connections in numerous historical ATC incident reports (Olsen, 2011; Cui and Li, 2015; Olsen and Williamson, 2017; Ni et al., 2019; Lyu et al., 2019; Kelly and Efthymiou, 2019). The identified contributing factors and general trends over time in incident reports is a crucial tool for safety performance assessment, providing aviation authorities with insightful suggestions for ATC process optimization and redesign (Olsen, 2011; Leonhardt, 2016; Lyu et al., 2019).====To date, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring the influencing factors of ATC incidents (Cui and Li, 2015), assessing the safety implications of ATC operations (Ni et al., 2019) and classifying the ATC incident reports (Olsen, 2011; Olsen and Williamson, 2017). For example, Cui and Li (2015) employed the panel regression model to identify influencing factors of civil aviation safety efficiency of ten Chinese airline companies from 2008 to 2012. They found that investments in training and developing aviation security staff had a greater impact on civil aviation safety than technology development (Cui and Li, 2015). Olsen (2011) attempted to investigate the causes of ATC incidents through coding and classifying incident records. A trial between ATC operators and human factor specialists was conducted to determine the reliability of ATC data classification system (Olsen, 2011). Ni et al. (2019) applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to select seven main factors from 68 kinds of aviation unsafe events for evaluating aviation safety performance. The seven principal components and weights from PCA were further input into deep belief network for the prediction of flight incident rate (Ni et al., 2019).====Although numerous researchers have examined the safety performance of ATC operation and explored potential causes of incidents, the limitations of previous studies are still prominent, mainly threefold. ====, statistical regression is a prevalent method to investigate the factors influencing ATC incidents. However, ATC incident reports are in textual form and inherently unstructured data, requiring manual extraction of candidate variables from each incident report during the initial stage of statistical modeling. This time-consuming process often suffers from cognitive subjectivity and lack of integrity data issues, leading to potentially biased estimation of the determinants (Washington et al., 2020). ====, most existing studies concentrate on the static assessment of ATC safety, and cannot fully reveal the evolution trend of contributing factors to ATC incidents. The temporal trend analyses could uncover the latent patterns of ATC incidents and their hidden correlations with air traffic rules and transportation policies over that period, which could also provide proactive and effective suggestions for future ATC operation. ====, the categorization and coding of ATC incident reports in previous studies were performed by providing each incident report a specific label from domain experts. The process is laborious and cannot automatically infer the incident patterns based only on the collected reports.====More recently, the advances in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning have greatly promoted the development of text data mining and semantic analyses (Mavridis and Symeonidis, 2014; Sun and Yin, 2017; Amplayo et al., 2018; Kuhn, 2018). Topic model, one of the NLP approaches, has emerged as a powerful technique for automatically discovering hidden topics from a large corpus of documents (Blei et al., 2003). The hidden topic here indicates the latent patterns that cannot be directly statistically observed in the dataset (Blei et al., 2003). Topic model is a data-driven unsupervised learning method and has exhibited robust performance in text data mining (Hasan and Ukkusuri, 2014; Bao et al., 2017). Nowadays, topic model has also attracted an increased attention in the field of transportation researches. Pereira et al. (2013) employed topic model to extract important features from two-year traffic accident cases, which were further fed into machine learning models for incident duration prediction. The result verifies that textual features from topic model have great potential to improve the prediction accuracy of traffic incident duration (Pereira et al., 2013). Sun and Yin (2017) applied topic model to identify fifty key topics from the published articles in leading transportation journals during the past twenty-five years. The result reveals that research communities in different regions tend to concentrate on different sub-fields (Sun and Yin, 2017). Wang et al. (2021) proposed a hybrid topic model to excavate hidden crash patterns from a large-scale motor crash records in Manhattan borough of New York City. The semantic topics could identify the hidden spatial-temporal patterns on motor vehicle crashes (Wang et al., 2021b).====Topic model has achieved great success in traffic incident analyses. However, it still suffers from some critical limitations when exploring the hidden topics and trends in ATC incident reports. ====, basic topic model only identifies some general topics from text reports, ignoring the temporal variation and trend evolution of ATC incident topics. ====, some known concurrences and inherent connections among the influencing factors of ATC may serve as prior information, guiding the model to identify more informative and predictive topics from ATC incident reports (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012). Such valuable information from domain experts have been largely ignored in basic topic models.====To fill the research gaps, we propose a ====omain-knowledge ====riven ====opic (DDT) model for investigating embedded topics and trends in ATC incident reports, which incorporates domain knowledge of ATC experts into basic topic model. To the best knowledge of the authors, this paper is one of the first attempts to employ a topic-model-based approach in the ATC incident reports analyses. The primary contributions of this study can be summarized as follows.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data source and text preprocessing work. Section 3 discusses the methodology of Latent Dirichlet Allocation and the proposed DDT model.

The CCs with CDA should update the air cargo business model to reflect current trends. Collaboration is recommended to balance supply and demand and reduce the dissimilarities between passenger and cargo transport businesses.","Before 2012, the air cargo growth rate was higher than air passenger transport (see Table 1). However, the growth rate of air cargo worldwide has decreased since 2010 to around 4.2%, compared to 6% decades ago (Boeing, 2000 to 2019). The weak growth trend of air cargo is ongoing and more observable for combination carriers (CCs) than all-cargo carriers and integrators (==== ====). The critical reasons for the lower growth rate of the air cargo business are the transition of product characteristics (Fisher, 2003), dissimilarities between the passenger and cargo business, and the absence of economies of scale between the passenger and cargo service networks (Johnston and Ozment, 2013; Reis and Silva, 2016), mainly for CCs employing cargo-dedicated aircraft (CDA) [Hong et al., 2018]. The cargo business of CCs has struggled due to changes in the international trade and competitive environment. Unlike the ﬁxed and known capacity of passenger seats, cargo space for CDA has more significant uncertainty regarding allocation and demand (Kasilingam, 1996; Morrell, 2011).====Cargo and passengers cannot be reasonably separated in the analysis because most of the inputs of CCs cannot be clearly attributed to either passenger or cargo alone (e.g., pilots, aircraft, majority of the fuel consumption, etc.). Besides, many of the core decisions made for cargo can be affected by the passenger volume; that is why dissimilarities exist and significantly damaged cargo business caused by passenger-oriented route networks for CCs. Air cargo has become an important revenue source for airlines (Feng et al., 2015). In recent years, many researchers have focused on the efficiency measures for all-cargo carriers (Balliauw et al., 2018) or integrators (Baxter and Srisaeng, 2018). The research on the cargo business of CCs has not received significant attention (Lange, 2019). This study focuses on the air cargo business of CCs that use the belly space of passenger aircraft and the main deck and belly space of CDAs for their air cargo business.====We use a stochastic frontier production approach (Kumbhakar et al., 2015) and estimate its unknown parameters using maximum likelihood. We assume that the environmental variables influence the implementation of the technology, and these variables should be influenced directly by the production function (Good et al., 1993) and the efficiency (Battese and Coelli, 1988). We measure the efficiency and the total factor productivity (TFP) of the CCs, focusing specifically on the air cargo business. In contrast, the environmental variables directly affect production and are assumed to influence efficiency directly. These measures allow us to estimate the expected impacts on efficiency, which changes in the environmental context when this environment is under control by the airline itself (the first-tier environmental variables), and other environment variables are under the control of national or international trends that are indirectly modifiable by the airline itself (the second-tier environmental variables).====Even though the role of the air cargo business for CCs that operate passenger and cargo operations jointly is significant, minimal research has been done on operational input and output data. Thus, this study fills the gap by applying operational data along with first- and second-tier environmental variables. Since the coronavirus pandemic began in January 2020, cargo flights surged with increased cargo-only missions for CCs, which contrasts to the reduction in passenger traffic (ICAO, 2020; Pasztor, 2020). There is limited passenger traffic and less belly space for passenger aircraft to haul air cargo, which means that the air cargo supply has consistently shrunk, as well as demand (Asiana Airlines, 2007 to 2020; Boeing, 2000 to 2019; Korean Airlines, 2007 to 2020). Thus, this study examines the yield, economies of scale and density, technical efficiency, and TFP for the cargo business of two Korean combination carriers. This article is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the previous literature on the air cargo business and the air cargo business of two Korean CCs—Korean Airlines (KE) and Asiana Airlines (OZ)—and measures production efficiency. Section 3 provides a methodology of stochastic frontier analysis using panel data. Section 4 handles the data, variables, and model specifications.

In addition, all around the world, the airport sector has been struck by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and 2021. Using a broad sample of data taken from Airport Service Quality (ASQ) surveys and robust econometric methodology, specifically, an Ordered Logit model with ====, this paper seeks to cover the gap in the academic literature regarding the effect of a worldwide pandemic on passenger satisfaction at airports during the 2015–2021 period, while taking into consideration the passenger profile and journey and airport attributes. It takes as its reference a Spanish regional airport, which had been experiencing a strong expansion process prior to the pandemic. With respect to the variables linked to the passenger profile, a differential behavior is observed in satisfaction depending on nationality, motive for travel, and destination. In addition, the four facility- and airport process-related dimensions are significant, with cleanliness and comfort standing out above all others. These are even more important in a health emergency scenario such as is currently being experienced. Lastly, 2021 is shown to cause a downturn in the positive passenger satisfaction with the airport that had been observed during the first year of the pandemic. Therefore, more long-term management is required alongside the initial rapid and efficient action taken by airports, with up-to-date information for passengers to internalize the inconveniences associated with this long-drawn-out period of uncertainty.",") and had a drastic impact on the airport experience all around the world (====).====Along with the changes for airlines and airports brought about by the emergence of the low-cost phenomenon (====; ====), rapid implementation of technological advances has led to the rollout of new automated systems for check-in, security checks, and boarding without the need for any external personnel to intervene (====; ====; ====), resulting in time savings but also possibly generating a certain degree of rejection among more elderly passengers (====; ====). In other respects, since the 9/11 attacks, security procedures have required passengers to arrive at the airport much earlier, exposed them to long delays at checkpoints, and even, in some extreme cases, seeing their airport closed (====). Airport operators can take advantage of these longer stays at the airport to turn waiting time into consumption time, thus directly affecting the passengers’ experiences and their purchasing intention and also benefiting non-aeronautical revenues (====).====), with Ultra Long-Haul point-to-point flights even being proposed to bypass crowded and potentially infected international hubs (====). Health authorities have laid down protocols at airports to afford passengers greater safety and guarantees in the face of COVID-19. Some limitations were also placed on air travel to reduce transmission of the virus between several regions and countries, which even led to airport closures. In figures, in 2020, demand (revenue passenger kilometers) fell by 65.9% compared to the full year of 2019, considered to be the steepest fall in air traffic in the history of aviation (====). However, air travel has picked up over 2021 despite interruptions due to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Notwithstanding, demand in 2021 was 58.4% down on 2019 (====).====Faced with these changes in airport morphology and an uncertain environment due to COVID-19, managers in the aeronautical market must adapt and prepare for future crises by developing more resistant organizations with a greater learning capacity (====). In this sense, one of the greatest challenges that airport operators face is the measurement, analysis, and mining of relevant information for passengers' perception of the service quality of their airport service. This information is required to improve the airport's operating indicators and to raise the quality of the services offered to passengers (====) to make their passage through the airport as stress-free as possible (====). Moreover, collecting information about these experiences at this particular time, during the pandemic, is crucial. Following ====, airports should be regarded in the same way as education centers, with the experience of all the users that come together in them used to achieve more agile and flexible management that benefits their recovery and prepares them for adapting to any future crises.====Passengers' perceptions of airport service attributes can be analyzed using data from airport review websites such as Skytrax (====; ====) or through a quantitative survey given to passengers during their passage through the airport. One example of the latter is the Airports Council International's (ACI) Airport Service Quality (ASQ) surveys (====), which will be used in this study. ACI ASQ surveys are currently carried out at 386 airports worldwide and over 75% of the 100 top airports in the world are ASQ survey members (====).====In this context, this paper's objective is to analyze global passenger satisfaction at Seville Airport (Spain) over a broad 7-year time period from 2015 to 2021, which includes the months after the state of alarm was declared in Spain (March 14, 2020) due to the COVID-19 pandemic to the end of 2021, to cover the gap in the academic literature regarding the effect of a worldwide pandemic on passenger satisfaction. Our broad sample spans 84 months, 22 of which were during the declared COVID-19 pandemic, and covers the successive waves of the virus (six waves in Spain up to February 2022), which enabled us to differentiate between 2020 and 2021. The inclusion of these months allows an analysis of whether this health and mobility crisis has resulted in any changes in passenger satisfaction compared to the previous normality context, with important implications for airport management. Other factors that traditionally might influence satisfaction have also been included, such as passenger sociodemographic profiles, the flight and airport characteristics, and the facilities and services offered. For this, a broad database of ASQ surveys administered to passengers at Seville Airport was used and a discrete demand level-based methodology with ==== was applied.====The choice of Seville Airport as the case study is justified by its status as a regional airport under expansion in recent years. Specifically, the airport experienced 75% growth in passenger numbers in the last five years (2015–2019), reaching 7,544,473 travelers in 2019, the highest figure for the third consecutive year and the highest in its history. However, as in other airports, the current situation regarding the international COVID-19 pandemic has put a brake on the growth that it had been experiencing since 2015. Specifically, in 2020, the total number of passengers fell by 69.3% compared to the previous year, with only 2,315,610 passengers passing through the airport facilities, while a slight recovery was noted in 2021 with a total of 3,444,459 passengers, which equates to a 48.7% increase over 2020 and almost half the number of passengers reached in 2019 (====). So, this airport's experience of a continual growth trend at the beginning of the period and a fall at the end due to COVID-19 can serve as an example to identify the factors that influence passengers' global ratings of an airport and help airport managers to adapt their facilities to their customers' needs in times of uncertainty around health due to the pandemic.====To meet this objective, this paper is organized as follows. After the Introduction, Section ==== analyzes the academic literature on passenger satisfaction at airports.

To close this gap, this study explored the spatial heterogeneity and determinants of flight seasonality from a supply-side perspective, using the monthly flights of 222 airports in China during 2018 as a sample. The following conclusions were drawn. First, domestic flights in China face seasonality due to the country's vast ==== and diverse natural environment. Second, from an airport perspective, seasonality is high in small airports serving remote places and in cities that are tourism destinations. Third, from a route perspective, feeder routes in the air transport network of China face higher seasonality when compared to trunk routes. Finally, airport size and a mix of natural landscape factors shape domestic flight seasonality at the national level. At the local level, most factors (e.g., airport size and temperature) are more evident in the northwest region.","While the spatial patterns of air transport have widely been investigated, its temporal dimension has remained largely unexplored despite the key implications of seasonality in flows. Yet as flight schedules are commonly characterized by daily temporal imbalances (Barnhart et al., 2003), air services might change across months. There are several reasons for this. First, demand for medium- and long-distance travel varies throughout the year (Xu et al., 2017), resulting in seasonal demand for air travel. Second, the operating seasons of some airports are time inconstant. For example, Burqin Kanasi Airport (KJI) and Xinyuan Nalati Airport (NLT) in Xinjiang, China, close as tourists disappear in winter. Third, some countries use different flight schedules according to the season. For instance, China's air passenger timetable (for regular flights) is divided into the summer and autumn timetable and the winter and spring timetable. However, most studies related to the (spatial) development of air transport are limited to using comprehensive data for one year (Guimera et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2011, 2014), or data for a “typical” period, such as one day, week, or month (Huang and Wang, 2017), which might bias their estimates. Recognizing seasonality can help reduce such bias (e.g., using data from different seasons). Thus, it is essential to explore seasonality.====Seasonality in the airline industry has long been reported by scholars from both air transport and tourism fields. However, most publications have focused on specific case studies, although Dobruszkes et al. (2022) recently proposed a global analysis of passenger air service seasonality at the airport level. Air transport seasonality focusing on the domestic market, route level, or local associating factors is still unknown. As a result, we still lack enough global knowledge about the geography and the determinants of this phenomenon. As a first step toward a more comprehensive understanding of seasonality in air traffic, this paper investigates the temporality of domestic air services in the whole of China. Indeed, China's heterogeneous natural, economic, and institutional landscape provides an excellent case to discuss the spatial heterogeneity and determinants of flight seasonality. On the one hand, China has a vast territory and a complex and diverse natural environment. For example, China is 5,500 km from north to south and 5,200 km from east to west, with Mount Everest 8,849 m above sea level and Turpan Basin 155 m below sea level. The same airport has various attractions (comparative advantage) for tourists in different periods (Suau-Sanchez and Voltes-Dorta, 2019); Hainan, located in China's tropical region, becomes the hottest destination for “refuge from the cold” in winter. On the other hand, enormous spatial variations in China's economic and institutional landscape (Zhu et al., 2018) shape heterogeneous sensitivity to season. For instance, airports in tourist cities have significantly reduced flights during the off-season.====Our approach is twofold. In the first step, we computed the well-known Gini index to measure and map flight seasonality from a supply-side perspective. Then we analyzed its determinants through geo-econometric models (i.e., multiscale geographically weighted regression, MGWR). By doing so, we hope to contribute to previous studies in the following aspects. First, considering most existing studies lack discussion on air transport changing across months, we systematically proposed and discussed the seasonality issue for the early time. Second, as stable seat capacity at the airport level might hide seasonality at the route level (Dobruszkes et al., 2022), we tried to map flight seasonality at the route level in this paper. Third, an in-depth understanding of flight seasonality's geographical characteristics allows air transport policy-makers to schedule the air routes rationally from a national perspective. The remaining parts of this paper are as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review. Section 3 details data and methods.

Finally, the fuzzy BWM is adopted to rank the identified criteria with respect to the relative importance of these criteria, it is found that the physical situation of the aircraft is the most important criterion for used aircraft acquisition. The results presented in this paper could assist decision-makers to focus on the crucial criteria for used aircraft acquisition.","Aircraft acquisition is one of the most important challenges for airline companies, even more so for cargo airlines (Deveci et al., 2022, Sanchez-Lozano and Rodriguez, 2020, Sanchez-Lozano et al., 2015). In fact, as new aircraft often cost quite a significant amount of money, many cargo airlines rely on used aircraft, i.e., retired passenger aircraft. Though these aircraft may not be suitable for passenger airlines, they could be used for cargo transportation after certain maintenance. Thus, used aircraft acquisition has become one of the main focuses of cargo airlines. However, it is a complex issue that involves many factors, and an aircraft with the best technical quality may not necessarily be the best option as many other factors could also play a role (Bi et al., 2021, Gao et al., 2020, Sun et al., 2011, Wang and Chang, 2007). As most aircraft could fulfill the technical requirement, it is unlike that any specific aircraft would stand out simply because of its superior technical quality, other factors such as price and the global economy would also significantly affect the decision-making process of the used aircraft acquisition (Ozdemir et al., 2011, Gomes et al., 2014, Dozic et al., 2018, Kiraci and Akan, 2020). Therefore, it is essential for airline companies to have a reliable and comprehensive mechanism to properly determine used aircrafts for acquisition.====With the rapid development of the civil aviation industry, especially the development of airlines that focus on short-range passenger and cargo transport, there is an increasing need for aircraft acquisition. Big airline companies tend to acquire new aircrafts as they could maximize their profit by employing these aircrafts on many of the highly profitable routes. However, some of the small airline companies may not be able to afford to prefer not to acquire new aircrafts due to the high price. Instead, used aircrafts have become an alternative option as they tend the acquire and renovate used aircrafts to fulfill their purposes, especially for cargo transportation.====Like other problems in the aviation industry, the aircraft acquisition problem can be viewed as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and there have been several studies (Hu and Zhang, 2015, Chao et al., 2017, Bimo et al., 2022). For instance, Yeh and Chang (2009) proposed a fuzzy MCDM method combining pairwise comparison, hierarchical weighting for aircraft selection. Sun et al. (2011) adopted ELimination and Choice Expressing REality, simple additive weighting and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution for aircraft concept selection, and introduced robustness to consider the uncertainty. Ozdemir and Basligil (2016) integrated fuzzy ANP and Choquet integral method for aircraft evaluation and selection, and applied the proposed method to the purchase of aircraft in a Turkish airline company. Dozic et al. (2018) proposed an aircraft selection method based on the fuzzy AHP and logarithmic fuzzy preference programming, and ten criteria are considered to select appropriate aircraft types for regional airlines. However, despite these advances, the used aircraft acquisition problem has not been properly studied, most of these studies only consider a few factors and ignore the different aspects of aircraft acquisition. Moreover, most current studies focus on the assessment and selection method, but there have been very few studies on which criteria and to what degree should be considered in used aircraft acquisition, which limits the reliability and effectiveness of the aircraft acquisition decision. Since there are multiple factors that affect the used aircraft acquisition operation, it is necessary to properly identify these factors and prioritize these factors to support the used aircraft acquisition.====For criteria prioritization, there have been several studies in different fields. For instance, Méxas et al. (2012) analyzed criteria affecting the selection of enterprise resource planning systems, and prioritized the criteria based on 79 respondents from industry experts. Jafarzadeh et al. (2022) studied criteria prioritization in project management, and proposed a criteria prioritization method based on the z-number best–worst method and z-number quality function deployment. Ogundoyin and Kamil (2020) studied the problem of fog computing by identifying and prioritizing trust parameters in fog computing using fuzzy AHP, and determined the most important criteria based on the prioritization results.

(2018) proposed an extended stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis for criteria prioritization, and applied the proposed method to prioritizing investment in high-tech industries. Akbar et al. (2020) identified and prioritized 21 challenges that impact cloud-based outsourcing software development using fuzzy AHP. However, there have not been studies that focus on the criteria prioritization problem for used aircraft acquisition. To this end, the identification and prioritization of criteria for used aircraft acquisition are studied in this paper.====For this problem, there are two challenges. One is how to properly identify these numerous criteria based on different kinds of documents, especially when previous research on this issue has been very limited. The other is how to compare and rank these criteria given the uncertain and interconnected nature of these criteria. Hence, how to properly represent the preference of the criteria under uncertainty is an urgent issue.====For the first challenge, grounded theory and empirical analysis are adopted in this paper. Since there is limited research on used aircraft acquisition, we further gathered documents from both aircraft manufacturers and airline companies. In order to properly identify all the criteria for used aircraft acquisition from this somewhat orderless information, we used the grounded theory, which is a systematic method of conducting research that shapes collecting data and provides explicit strategies for analyzing them (Chun Tie et al., 2019, Charmaz and Belgrave, 2019, Bryant and Charmaz, 2019, Belgrave and Seide, 2019), to sort and analyze this information. Furthermore, concerned about the possibility that the identified may not be completely reliable as they are not confirmed by industry experts, we conducted an empirical analysis based on a questionnaire survey to gather information from the experts. By analyzing the judgments provided by the experts, the identified criteria could be further improved.====For the second challenge, the fuzzy set theory and best–worst method (BWM) are employed in this paper. In order to determine the priority of the identified criteria, the judgments of experts are collected. Since it is impractical for the experts to provide their judgments in terms of precise values because of the uncertainty in the real world, linguistic terms are utilized to model the judgments of the experts, and the fuzzy set theory, which has been widely used to represent assessments under uncertainty (Hao et al., 2017, Tyagi and Akram, 2013, Karakose et al., 2018, Ping et al., 2020, Jing et al., 2021, Gao et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2020), is adopted to represent the uncertain judgments of the experts by transforming linguistic terms into triangular fuzzy numbers in the sake of simplifying the computation. In order to prioritize the criteria while considering their relative importance, an extension of the BWM, namely, fuzzy BWM, is used. Serving as an extension of the BWM, which itself has been widely used for the ability to reduce the number of pairwise comparisons by only comparing all other objects with the best and worst objects (Maghsoodi et al., 2019, Mi et al., 2019, Mi and Liao, 2019, Rezaei, 2015), the fuzzy BWM could properly deal with uncertainty in the BWM process (Guo and Zhao, 2017, Hafezalkotob and Hafezalkotob, 2017, Dong et al., 2021, Mostafaeipour et al., 2021), and could provide reliable and accurate results for the prioritization of the criteria for used aircraft acquisition.====By integrating grounded theory, empirical analysis and fuzzy BWM, a novel and effective approach for used aircraft acquisition criteria prioritization is presented, and 40 criteria are identified to be important to used aircraft acquisition. Furthermore, these criteria are prioritized according to their relative importance given by the experts, it is found that physical situation of the aircraft is believed to be the most important criterion for used aircraft acquisition. The main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows:====(1) Through grounded theory analysis and empirical analysis, a total of 40 criteria, corresponding to 4 different aspects, are identified in this paper, which could provide standard and support for comprehensive used aircraft acquisition.====(2) Based on the knowledge of the experts, the fuzzy BWM is used to rank all 40 criteria for used aircraft acquisition according to their relative importance and weights. All 40 criteria are ranked, and the most important criteria are determined, which allows the decision-makers to prioritize the more important factors during used aircraft acquisition.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces the fuzzy set theory and best–worst method. Section 3 describes the proposed criteria prioritization approach. The results are presented in Section 4 with some discussions.

The contractor evaluates two options: a usage-based contract (considering a rate per hour) and an availability-based contract (considering a fixed monthly rate). We study the contractor’s decision-making process in which it chooses the type of contract and the number of customers to be served, while prices are negotiated.====The negotiation price is determined keeping into account the options available for the airlines given that they may choose other market alternatives (in case of disagreement) such as aircraft purchase instead of leasing and performing maintenance in-house instead of subcontracting. The main objective of the research is to investigate how these alternative market options influence on the contractor’s decision.====The importance of considering leasing and maintenance services in a single contract offer, known as PSS (Product–Service Systems), is that other relevant stakeholders of the aviation industry, such as independent MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) organizations or lessors, may adopt additional means to compete with OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers). Indeed, PSS can be viewed as a “servitization” business model of a product seller/lessor (Visnjic Kastalli and Van Looy, 2013) or as a “productisation” business model of a service provider (Harkonen et al., 2015). For example, aircraft lessors bundling maintenance services to the leased aircraft corresponds to the first approach, while non-OEM MROs offering rental of spare engines for the period in which airline-owned one is being maintained illustrates the latter situation.====In addition, maintenance outsourcing has reached around 65% of airlines’ maintenance budget (Al-Kaabi et al., 2007) and global expenses on MRO is expected to grow from ====90 Billion in 2020 to ====130 Billion by 2030 (Cooper et al., 2020). Also, market evidence shows that more than half of commercial aircraft are under a lease contract (Gavazza, 2010).

The profit inefficiency of airlines is then decomposed into two stages: cost inefficiency in the production stage and revenue inefficiency in the consumption stage. Both cost inefficiency and revenue inefficiency are further decomposed into three sub-inefficiencies: technical inefficiency, price inefficiency, and allocation inefficiency. The empirical results show that all airlines are profit inefficient and their profit inefficiency is due to different sub-inefficiency components. In terms of overall profit inefficiency, the revenue inefficiency at the consumption stage is the main cause, and price inefficiency is a major component of revenue inefficiency on average.","With the continuous advancement of world economic integration, the importance of the airline industry in the development and prosperity of the world economy has become increasingly prominent. According to statistics from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in 2018, about 850 billion US dollars (USD) were spent on international travel by air, and the value of air cargo was estimated to be 6.7 trillion USD, which accounted for 33% of the world trade by value but less than 1% of world trade by volume (IATA, 2019). However, more challenges in this market come with aviation deregulation advancement, participation of low-cost carriers, high-speed rail competition on the same routes (Manello et al., 2022), rising labor costs and fluctuating fuel prices, global economic slowdown, and unstable international politics. In such environment, with operation characteristics of high risk and high investment, airlines are faced with the crisis of survival and development. Thus, they urgently need to improve their profit efficiency. Moreover, due to the non-storable nature of air transport (Yu, 2012), exploring the decomposition of profit efficiency has become increasingly important, which the profit efficiency of airlines comes from the production and consumption stage.====In the data envelopment analysis (DEA) literature, the profit efficiency of a firm is usually decomposed into technical and allocation efficiency (Cooper et al., 2011). Allocation efficiency measures the loss due to an inappropriate mix of inputs and outputs at a given market price. This concept of profit efficiency can be traced back to Farrell (1957). However, traditional DEA models treat airlines' operating process as a black box and do not consider the internal structure of airlines' operating process. It is not only reflected in airline technical efficiency study(e.g., Schefczyk, 1993; Bhadra, 2009; Barros and Peypoch, 2009), but also in cost efficiency (e.g., Ouellette et al., 2010; Merkert and Hensher, 2011) and profit efficiency study (e.g., Coelli et al., 2002). In addition, to meet the typical airline's goal of maximizing traffic output, customer satisfaction and profitability, Merkert and Pearson (2015) estimated a single technical efficiency indicator that combines traffic outputs with service quality and profit margins into a DEA model. However, airline operations are characterized by intermediate outputs (i.e., available seat miles and available ton miles) that cannot be stored. This means that their business involves how to efficiently produce intermediate output and efficiently attract more demand to achieve maximum utilization of intermediate output. The ‘black box’ model makes airline efficiency evaluation easier, but it does not quite fit with the airlines. In such case, Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) has enabled Decision Making Units (DMUs) to gain insight into inefficient processes within the system. By considering the internal structure of airlines, an increasing number of airlines technical efficiency studies are using the NDEA approach (e.g., Lozano and Gutiérrez, 2014; Li et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2019). But few attempts have been made to develop a decomposition of their profit efficiencies.====The imperfectly competitive market environment in which airlines operate adds to the complexity of studying their profit efficiency. Most of countries or regions do not have a large number of airlines because of the capital-, technology- and labor-intensive nature of air transport and its important role in national sovereignty and defence security. It is also difficult for airlines to enter or exit the market. In this context, the imperfectly competitive market environment gives airlines the ability to be a price maker. For the input segment, airlines have controls over staff salaries and fuel prices. With the progress of deregulation in the air transport industry, airlines also have a large degree of control over the prices of their passenger and cargo transport services. In perfectly competitive markets, the law of one price (LoOP) simplifies the study of economic efficiency (Camanho and Dyson, 2008), but LoOP is a theoretical property that does not hold in real life in the imperfectly competitive markets.====Since the intermediate outputs of airlines cannot be stored, they are usually fixed in the short term as outputs in the production stage and as inputs in the consumption stage. Note that for a given intermediate output, the production stage seeks to achieve the lowest cost (Cost Efficiency, CE) while the consumption stage seeks to achieve the maximum revenue (Revenue Efficiency, RE). CE evaluates the ability of a DMU to produce the current outputs at the lowest cost given the price of its inputs. RE also evaluates the ability of a DMU to produce the maximum revenue given its current input and output prices, respectively. For managers are making decisions with inperfectly competitive and non-storable intermediate outputs, the use of LoOP assumption and ‘black box’ model may distort the profit efficiencies of airlines.====Being particularly interested in ensuring that the methodology we propose provides information that is meaningful to managers. For example, when we tell a manager that the short-term profit he/she has observed is below the maximum possible, given the existing fixed intermediate output volumes, we would like to show what percentage of this profit inefficiency is due to cost inefficiency in the production stage and what percentage is due to income inefficiency in the consumption stage. Furthermore, we can explain the reasons for the inefficiencies based on the technical inefficiencies, price or allocation inefficiencies. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to measure the extent to which the profits of a multi-input, multi-output airline with a network production structure deviate from maximum short-term profits, and then to decompose this profit inefficiency into components that are practically meaningful to managers. In particular, we are interested in measuring price inefficiency due to an imperfectly competitive market, and in measuring the contribution of technical inefficiency and allocation inefficiency to this profit inefficiency.====In this paper, we show that all these problems can be solved. First, we propose a new two-stage NDEA-based profit efficiency decomposition. It involves maximizing short-run profits while intermediate output is held constant. Second, by using the profit efficiency analysis of imperfectly competitive markets advocated by Yu (2020), we show how overall profit efficiency can be estimated and decomposed.====The contribution of this study is twofold. Firstly, based on the internal network operational structure of the airlines, a network DEA approach for profit efficiency analysis is used to open up the 'black box' and explores the operation of the airlines’ production and consumption stages. Secondly, based on the imperfectly competitive market environment in which airlines operate, input and output prices are adjustable characteristics. The contribution of price efficiency to profit efficiency is also explored in addition to technical and allocation efficiency.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the previous DEA research literature associated with technical efficiency, cost efficiency and profit efficiency of airlines. Section 3 introduces the new model developed in this study. Section 4 presents the samples, variables, and data sources. The Non-Competitive Nerlovian profit inefficiencies, two-stage inefficiencies, and sub-efficiencies scores of the sample airlines are analyzed in Section 5.

Data comes from the U.S. aviation ","It has long been believed that a firm's financing can affect its product market strategies. Although the vast majority of literature focuses on the consequences of financial shortfalls for pricing decisions, the basic idea can be extended to quality. If maintaining high quality is costly, a firm with financial difficulty may compromise quality in order to cut costs and preserve current cash flows (e.g., Maksimovic and Titman [1991], Shen [2003], Bazzoli et al., [2007], Bazzoli et al., [2008], Matsa [2011], Adelino et al., [2015], Kini et al., [2017], Maksimovic and Titman [1991], Shen [2003], Bazzoli et al., [2007], Bazzoli et al., [2008], Matsa [2011], Adelino et al., [2015], and Kini et al., [2017]).====This paper tests this hypothesis empirically using data from the U.S. aviation industry. I ask how an airline's quality of service, proxied by on-time performance (OTP), is affected by its financial conditions, represented by the probability of default. Establishing a link between financial variables and product market behaviours constitutes a well-known challenge for empirical research in this field, as the two can be mutually endogenous. In this paper, following the spirit of Goolsbee and Syverson [2008], Prince and Simon [2015], and Ma [2019], I use the staggered entry of Southwest Airlines, a leading low-cost carrier (LCC) which has expanded rapidly in the past few decades, as an exogenous increase in competition in the U.S. air travel market. The purpose is to investigate whether incumbent airlines with different financial conditions react differently to the variation in the market, and if so, how?====Based on a panel data from the first quarter of 1993 through to the last quarter of 2018, I estimate a set of models similar to an event study, where the interaction terms between the Merton default probability and a series of time dummies surrounding Southwest's entry are included. Regression results unveil that default probability plays an important role in determining the quality provisions of incumbents. High probability is not only related to poor quality performance in general, but also to a degradation of quality following the entry event.====To obtain a clearer interpretation of the latter result, I slice the sample according to the probability of default and perform subsample analysis. Specifically, I partition the sample based on the 30th-70th percentile of the default probability.==== Observations whose default probability during the last quarter of the reference period is below the 30th percentile in that quarter are denoted as financially healthy, and observations with a default probability above the 70th percentile in that quarter are denoted as financially distressed.==== Results indicate that the financially healthy group and the distressed group reacts very differently to Southwest's entry. Following the entry event, the former significantly improves OTP, whereas the latter behaves in the opposite manner and worsens OTP. These findings further highlight the role of financial conditions.====Although the primary aim of this article is to study quality responses, I also take a look at incumbent price responses since these decisions are likely to be interrelated (Forbes [2008], Yimga [2017], Gayle and Yimga [2018], Forbes [2008]; Yimga [2017]; Gayle and Yimga [2018]). I find that financial pressure has a clear impact on price responses, with incumbents under higher pressure reducing prices much more aggressively upon Southwest's entry. Overall, these conclusions are consistent with firms in poor financial situation being more impatient, which gives managers incentives to cut down quality-related investments and compete on prices in order to boost short-run cash flows.====After demonstrating the effect of financial health on incumbent responses, I undertake a series of robustness tests. I check whether Southwest's decision to enter a route is related to the default probability of incumbents, with the results providing no evidence to support such a correlation. I also attempt shortening the time span of the sample, including more incumbents, and using unweighted models. The results are qualitatively similar to the benchmark.====This article contributes to two strands of literature. It adds to the literature that examines the effect of financing on product market decisions. Very little research in this area focuses on incumbent quality responses to entry, and none provides evidence that the direction of these responses, improvement or deterioration, may vary with the financial status of incumbents. The findings also complement the literature regarding the effect of competition on airline delays. Prior studies on this issue have reached varying conclusions. Some scholars suggest that competition drives quality levels up (e.g, Mazzeo [2003], Greenfield [2014], Cao et al., [2017], Mazzeo [2003], Greenfield [2014], and Cao et al., [2017]), whereas others find it does not (e.g., Ater [2012], Prince and Simon [2015], Ater [2012]; Prince and Simon [2015]). This study demonstrates that the connection between competition and quality is influenced by the financial health of carriers, which is in line with, and potentially explain, the ambiguous empirical evidence.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Nowadays, air travel has become an important transportation in life. Travel by airline helps to save time and shorter the distance to travel from one place to another. Offering a better service to airline customers is extremely crucial in the existing competing environment for the development of airlines. Service providers necessitate comprehending customers' expectations from the services with the aim of better dealing with their wants and expectations. When service quality (SQ) does not fulfill the customers’ expectations, they become discontented (Kau and Loh, 2006). Hence, measuring airline SQ based on the views of the customers becomes imperative for comprehending the needs of the users and subsequently enhancing the service.====Connectivity is an indicator of a country's development. All the state affairs like administration, commerce, industry, tourism, medical evacuation etc. are dependent on the communication system of a country. Good communication means traveling distance with less effort. With the growth of population and economic development of the country the load on each type of transportation system is increasing. Bangladesh has turn out to be a low-cost production center and industries from adjacent countries are moved to Bangladesh for low-cost labor and moderately secured environment, (Ahsan et al., 2014). The export processing zones are located at different districts of the country and hundreds of economic zones are coming up at different places all over the country where besides the natives' many foreigners are being employed. For the fast movement of personal, raw materials and products to and from these zones, fast transport system is essential. Bangladesh is also a growing tourist destination where domestic tourism is growing very fast. For all these reasons air traffic demand in Bangladesh has undergone very rapid development the in last two decades. To meet this demand a number of domestic airline operators have come up and operating in Bangladesh and it is the fastest growing transportation mode in Bangladesh (Rahman et al., 2010).====Whether people travel for work, recreation or treatment they want comfortable and short duration journey. Domestic airlines can fulfill both if they can provide satisfactory service as supplied by many providers. When people choose airlines as a mode of communication with higher expenditure, they expect a better service. The enhancement in delivered SQ can draw the attention of more customers and thus can contribute to the development of the whole system. This research endeavors to evaluate the service quality provided by the domestic airlines service in Bangladesh.====Both public and private airline operators are providing service in Bangladesh. In domestic routes 80% of total number of passengers is carried by private airlines. Out of four operators providing service in domestic routes, Biman Bangladesh Airlines is the country's national airline. Rests three are US-Bangla, Novo Air and Regent Airways. Although the share of domestic airlines in the overall transportation system of Bangladesh was very small (1%) till 2010 (Rahman et al., 2010) but a rising trend of airlines users in the country can be observed from Fig. 1. By addressing this demand, the government can improve the overall communication standard of the country. The percentage of passengers on domestic flights was 22.8% in 1999 as estimated by Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB). The average annual growth of the number of domestic air passengers from 2010 to 2017 was 6.4% (CAAB, 2018). .====Several researches investigate on the evaluations of airline customers in Western nations (e.g. Gursoy et al., 2005 2005; Blaise et al., 2014), little research has been done on the airline customers’ perceptions in Asian countries, like Bangladesh.

Understanding the basic factors affecting airline performance has become even more critical since the unexpected crisis that occurred during the pandemic. There is a need to conduct multidimensional performance measurements that consider both financial and non-financial perspectives to improve the performance of an airline company. However, existing studies have only focused on the financial aspects of this issue. One main contribution of the current research is the use of a sustainability balanced score card (SBSC) approach of evaluating airline companies based on multidimensional analysis. The balanced score card (BSC) analyzes the performance of companies from finance, customers, internal processes, and learning and growth perspectives. Financial efficiency analyses are based on financial ratios and are revealed in financial statistics. Performance analyses from the perspective of the customers evaluate perceptions and satisfaction of customers. The internal perspective evaluates the efficiency of the processes used by the company, and learning and growth efficiency highlights the company tendency to use new projects and qualified employees (Kaplan and Norton, 1996).====In this study, as a new contribution, the sustainability score card, which also includes the environmental dimension, was added to the four original dimensions. In recent years, social responsibility and sustainable growth have become major issues for business organizations. These circumstances have resulted in SBSC as a new approach, which addresses the shortcomings of the traditional BSC with its fifth dimension called the “environmental” perspective. This dimension utilizes indicators related to social responsibility and sustainability to evaluate decision-making units (DMUs). Sarraf and Nejad (2020), Dolasinski et al. (2019), Basso et al. (2018), Tan et al. (2017), and Vitezić et al. (2019) integrated the BSC and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate efficiency. Aydın et al. (2020) and Amado et al. (2012) merged the BSC with network-based super-efficient DEA. In this way, they attempted to more clearly highlight the real differences in the efficiencies of DMUs.====The main motivation and contribution of this research is the performance evaluation of airline companies based on all five dimensions of SBSC to reveal the basic driving forces behind these efficiencies. Such an evaluation will provide a good road map for airline managers to prepare a plan to compete and survive in the future. For this purpose, an integrated two-stage super-efficiency model and SBSC approach were initially developed. Subsequently, the Simar–Wilson model was used to highlight the basic driving forces behind these efficiencies.====Traditional DEA methods suffer from poor discrimination between efficient and inefficient DMUs, which can result in their incorrect classification. To overcome this problem, a two-stage super-efficiency DEA approach was proposed. This approach considers the relationships between the different efficiency models. The overall efficiency scores of the decision units are equal to the product of the efficiencies of its two sub-processes. In other words, the efficiency of the decision unit is defined as the product of its subprocesses. For an airline to be efficient in the two-stage DEA model, both its subprocesses must perform efficiently. If one of the subprocesses is inefficient, the overall efficiency score of the relevant airline will decrease. Further, the source(s) of inefficiency in the general process can be determined more accurately and specifically (Kao and Hwang, 2008). More importantly, a two-stage super-efficiency model also allows for the ranking efficient DMUs with efficiency scores higher than one (Zhou et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020).====To the best of our knowledge, no studies have integrated two-stage super-efficiency SBM and SBSC approaches to evaluate the performance of DMUs. This is the first study to evaluate the performance of 35 international airlines using this integrated framework, which also highlights the basic explanatory variable behind the performance using the Simar–Wilson approach.====The framework of this study can be summarized as follows: In Section 2, research focusing on the performance evaluation of airlines is analyzed. A detailed discussion related to DEA-based evaluations is provided, including their major findings and selection of input and output indicators. Section 3 provides a flowchart of the proposed methodology as well as the inputs and outputs selected to evaluate the efficiency of the airline companies in terms of each of the five dimensions. Brief information about the theories of the two-stage super-efficiency DEA model and Simar–Wilson analysis are also provided.

This research concludes that brand love partially mediates the relationship between brand experience and brand satisfaction in the aviation sector. Airline managers need to focus their strategies on event marketing and marketing communication as they have a significant effect on brand experience.

Expectations of the customers can be understood by interacting with them (====; ====). At times the direct interactions are difficult to manage (====; ====). Now the climacteric in which the airline industry stands after the disruption in the economy caused by the spread of coronavirus is wreaking havoc on the aviation sector. Still, it is expected that the aviation industry would find a solution to the problem faced by airlines in connecting with the passengers and providing them better experiences in the future (====).====The International Air Transport Association (IATA) stated that the passengers carried by airlines during 2020 reduced as against the passengers who travelled during the corresponding period of the previous year, the reduction is due to the spread of COVID which has caused great financial loss to the aviation sector. Accordingly, ==== stated as the pandemic has resulted in massive changes to the passenger experience, improving or preserving the services is a critical issue for airline managers. According to the study by ====, the global air transport sector was knocked down severely by the effects of the pandemic when travel restrictions were implemented. ==== found that Twitter is an effective platform for direct communication between passengers and airlines in the US air transportation industry. Likewise, ====, ==== conducted a study that revealed several insights into how airlines use social media to meet their target audiences. In a developing experience economy the customer is considered as a guest, seeking a highly personalised and memorable interaction with the brand (====). Corresponding to it, this study assits airline management to take decisions and formulate communication strategies to face competition.====Customers not only acquire, utilize and dispose of products and services that meet their desires, they also purchase brands for the experience of certain interactions (B. H. ====). ====). ==== provides marketing managers with a useful theoretical foundation for conceptualizing brand experience by the use of experiential marketing strategies. Airline brands conduct international exhibitions and conferences intending to connect with the customers for example; Indian airline, ‘====’ launched a brand campaign called ‘IndiGo Abroad: Happy to be your first’. The airline endeavored to tug the passenger's emotions when they travel. Royal Dutch Airlines – launched a program in which the airline agreed to follow people who announced their plans to fly with the airlines on social media, the airlines then gave them gifts as they waited at the airport. They published videos of these campaigns with passengers enjoying music and seeming very happy. In such experiential marketing events, all the customers' senses are mobilized towards the airline brand experience. Perks like offering goodies, upgrading the tickets, or a free trip at an experiential marketing event shall bring benefit by allowing customers to remember their airline experience (====).====A plethora of research has explored brand experience from different perspectives. ==== proposed four dimensions for brand experiences: sensory, affective, intellectual and behavioral. Scant empirical research exists relating to experiential marketing theory in the aviation sector. This study aims to contribute by bridging the branding divide by examining interactions through the lens of airline brands. The airline service is chosen as the study's subject because it belongs to a sector where due to intense competition, airlines throughout the globe have been compelled to abandon their old strategies (====) and airlines can confront opposition by enhancing the overall experience of their passengers.====Traditional marketing campaigns centred on discounts and loyalty programmes are less successful since rivals may readily copy and outperform the services (====). Therefore, knowing marketing communication protocols and event marketing may facilitate the development of more streamlined and safe passenger experiences.

So, the unique character of the airline services, which differs significantly from other service industries, necessitates more research to investigate techniques that might be developed based on experiences. Passengers have greater expectations as a result of increased airline rivalry. Considering the priority that literature places on customer satisfaction, airlines often fall short of satisfying their customers. The airline sector has been rated worse than the tobacco industry in terms of customer happiness (====); thus, it is of the highest significance to comprehend the function that passenger experience plays in generating customer satisfaction.

The implementation of internationally-accepted criteria is required to integrate and strengthen an MRO safety oversight system. This study attempts to identify and analyze the relevant safety indicators to evaluate an MRO oversight system. It does so by applying the IPA and Kano model with 182 expert surveys from Korea. We identify twelve key safety indicators for the safety oversight system. The importance of the selected indicators is confirmed, but performance scores are significantly lower. The results suggest that the management and training of technical personnel should be prioritized to improve the Korean MRO ====. Identified indicators all show must-be attributes, indicating they are mandatory to safety. Oversight inspectors and inspectees are confirmed to have similar levels of safety awareness. It appears that safety standards increase as the years of experience accumulate, but this is not statistically confirmed. This study improves upon the existing safety oversight system literature with a focus on maintenance. As such, it will help solve maintenance outsourcing safety issues by standardizing and providing benchmarks for MRO safety oversight.","The aviation industry has been undergoing qualitative as well as quantitative changes as it reacts to the COVID-19 pandemic (International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), 2020a). Aviation safety is no exception. ICAO has endeavored to fill gaps in safety oversights caused by the pandemic (ICAO, 2020b). Traditional on-site safety oversight cannot be conducted during the pandemic, requiring a switch to a new virtual oversight method (Aviation Week, 2021).====From the start of the pandemic in March 2020, air travel demands plummeted significantly impacting profitability of all air transport industry participants (IATA, 2022). Airlines, posted losses of over $118 billion and return on invested capital of −17.7% in 2020 (IATA, 2020b), deferred or cancelled aircraft maintenance and modifications to preserve cash to survive (Aviation Week, 2021; Oliver Wyman, 2021b). The maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) industry was expected to lose more than $60 billion from spending cuts in 2020 and 2021 (Oliver Wyman, 2021a). MRO businesses responded by cutting back investment, increasing operational efficiency, reducing headcounts, downsizing inventories, and shutting down facilities. However, the negative impacts on MRO demand would continue post-pandemic: airlines retired older aircrafts prematurely during the slowdown to save on expensive major overhaul and later-life maintenance, resulting in a lucrative business lost for MRO providers (ICF, 2020; Oliver Wyman, 2021a; Oliver Wyman, 2021b; Satair, 2021; Lufthansa Technik, 2020; SIA Engineering Company, 2020; IATA, 2022). Reduction in MRO industry as a result of COVID-19, especially the shortage of skilled labor, is likely to influence the caliber of MRO works linked to safety (Adrienne et al., 2020; Aviation Week, 2021; Oliver Wyman, 2021b; Satair, 2021).====To ensure aviation safety, MRO is critical (Kraus and Gramopadhye, 2001; Sit et al., 2013). With that in mind, each state performs safety oversights according to its own MRO system. An MRO organization can have multiple certifications issued by different states, and the organization can be under multiple oversight jurisdictions. This can cause redundant oversight, which would waste the limited resources (e.g., time and expertise) designated for safety management. ICAO proposed a roadmap to integrate and reinforce an MRO safety oversight program at the regional/international level (ICAO, 2015). The U.S. has already attempted to minimize overlaps in oversight with partner countries by signing bilateral aviation safety agreements (which are titled Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement – Maintenance Implementation Procedures (BASA-MIP)) to establish an effective and systematic approach to its MRO (Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), 2020a). Singapore, whose MRO industry has the largest presence in Asia, has proposed the implementation of mutual recognition agreements, the division of oversight responsibilities, or the drafting of joint reviews by sharing information to reduce inefficiencies (ICAO, 2010). A bilateral supervision delegation or co-execution assumes that there are systems with the same level of aviation safety oversight, guaranteeing accountable supervision and credible safety results. To achieve systematic consensus, ICAO has provided eight standards (primary aviation legislation, specific operating regulations, state civil aviation system and safety oversight functions, technical personnel qualification and training, technical guidance, tools and the provision of safety-critical information, authorization and approval obligations, surveillance obligations, and the resolution of safety concerns) to analyze safety oversight (ICAO, 2006). The U.S. also checks for equivalent levels of safety oversight by drawing up checklists (FAA, 2020b).====According to Oliver Wyman (2022), the total MRO market size was estimated to increase 2.6% annually from 2019 pre-pandemic levels to reach $126.6 billion by 2032. The recovery is expected to start in the second half of 2022 but not to pre-COVID levels of long-term growth projections (Oliver Wyman, 2021a). Growth is still forecasted to be faster in the Asia Pacific region. In fact, Asian Sky Media (2020) reported that Asian MRO businesses had not been seriously hit by COVID-19. In this region, which includes China and India, the MRO market has been forecasted to reach $47.4 billion by 2032, growing 4.6% annually from 2019 levels (Oliver Wyman, 2022). With that potential for growth, many governments are attempting to seize opportunities in the high-value niches of the MRO market (Hampson et al., 2015; Vieira and Loures, 2016). Korea, which ranks seventh globally in terms of air transport traffic volume (ICAO, 2019a), has been implementing policies to help promote the still nascent Korean MRO industry. The Korean MRO industry has not been competitive with the outflow of domestic demand overseas until recently, when the government saw an opportunity to expand its MRO market with the nation's high quality human resources. The government instituted regulations on maintenance technician training. These regulations extended from programs to facilities in an effort to achieve international standards of quality and safety (Ministry of Land, 2020). Korea also successfully underwent ICAO's Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program – Continuous Monitoring Approach (USOAP-CMA) and the FAA's International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA), thereby confirming that the nation had achieved a high degree of aviation safety. However, USOAP-CMA, IASA, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) do not encompass all areas of maintenance safety. Therefore, ICAO has separately mandated maintenance safety through two additional documents – Annex 8 and Doc 9760 – to better address systematic and effective airworthiness.====Establishing an oversight system is required to secure maintenance safety and reliability. As the importance of maintenance oversight has grown (for integration, multilateral agreements, and the absence of face-to-face demand due to COVID-19), the need for close scrutiny over each state's maintenance oversight has arisen. However, there is a dearth of literature on maintenance oversight systems and no consensus on how to evaluate them. Therefore, this study uses interviews with experts to identify indicators that constitute an MRO safety oversight system. We analyze whether these indicators represent appropriate criteria for the evaluation of safety supervision. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) and Kano model are applied to Korean expert survey data to access the quality of the safety oversight system in Korea. Korea has been actively seeking global recognition in the area of approved maintenance organization (AMO) starting from the Asia-Pacific region (ICAO, 2019b). As Korea prepares itself to foster the MRO industry, it is only proper to examine Korea's maintenance oversight system for possible improvements as a stepping stone for the global recognition the country seeks. While ICAO's USOAP-CAM secures the minimum level of safety by demanding effective implementation, IPA evaluates both the importance and performance of indicators, and it is designed to provide strategic alternatives considering input and time limitations. The Kano model helps clarify the characteristics of the indicators in addition to importance. This allows us to assign the improvement priorities of the indicators with the same importance for efficiency and effectiveness. Lastly, this study diagnoses the current aviation safety oversight in Korea based on the results and proposes a plan to secure an international level oversight system to expand international cooperation. We discuss the potential of expanding the conclusions to other states for MRO safety oversight program integration.","An maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) safety oversight system analysis: A case in Korea",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001685,12 December 2022,2022,Research Article,48.0

It is therefore challenging to maximize the number of aircraft performing CDOs for an airport, especially in busy terminal maneuvering areas.

Using the UAM-AUM scale we apply ==== analysis for model validation based on data collected from 348 participants and the results strongly support the proposed model. Perceived usefulness is found to be the strongest determinant of user behavioural intention and mediates the effects of UAM acceptance, influencing the intention to use the system along with other variables.

The findings provide practical guidance for designing strategic interventions to improve public acceptance of UAM systems.","The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is a new attractive scholarly and professional research consideration for researchers and the sectors and institutions trying to adapt to accelerated technological transformation. Industry 4.0 refers to the accelerated digitalisation and technological transformation process in all sectors, and the transportation sector undoubtedly has the intention and obligation to keep pace with this trend. In the process of the innovative transformation in the transportation sector, electric vehicles will increase dominance in all modes of transportation. Electric vehicles are expected to significantly impact future transportation systems with substantial appeal for reducing energy consumption and emissions through combining high efficiency with low energy use in comparison to traditional methods (Xu et al., 2020, p. 2). Ongoing research and the transformation of road transportation will inevitably reflect other modes and approaches to transport. Given its high energy consumption and emissions, the air transport system, with its existing infrastructure, is not an efficient option compared to other transport modes, particularly for short distances (Liu et al., 2016, p. 280). The new paradigm of UAM has emerged in air transport to address this demand, an innovative concept referencing safe and efficient passenger or cargo transportation activities in urban areas using electric vertical take-off and landing (e-VTOL) aircraft (Kleinbekman et al., 2018, p. 1).====Autonomous and electric vehicles are projected to be an important future transportation choice and will particularly benefit those who have previously been at a disadvantage, such as the disabled and elderly. It is estimated that the demand for UAM systems and autonomous vehicles will increase over time and could achieve use similar to the heavy vehicle traffic experienced on highways today (Wang et al., 2020a, p. 298). Although consumers’ acceptance and use of new transportation is thought to be in high demand for road transport, the question of how much or when this transformation will be in the sky remains. The arising queries and uncertainties encountered during this new and exciting advancement towards low-flying air-based transport for both suppliers and passengers are another research interest. Although the economic potential of UAM is revitalising, it faces obstacles for security, safety and community acceptance. From privacy violations to affordability concerns, many elements of public acceptance that need to be addressed also stand out (Thipphavong et al., 2018).====The factors affecting the acceptance of users of urban air mobility (UAM) systems will be presented by creating a theoretical urban air mobility acceptance and use model (UAM-AUM) proposed in the study.

To mitigate these negative consequences, the airline industry and air traffic control (ATC) have made significant efforts. For example, it is common practice for airlines to adjust flight schedules to absorb and prevent delays from being propagated. Integrated disruption management with flight planning has also been considered to help with schedule recovery once delay occurs (e.g., Clausen et al., 2010; Marla et al., 2016). On the ATC side, many traffic management procedures including Ground Delay Programs (GDP), Airspace Flow Programs (AFP), and Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) have been developed to balance flight demand with terminal and en-route airspace capacity and stream air traffic. The goal of these efforts is to minimize delays and maximize the extent to which aircraft fly according to schedule. Along with these efforts, understanding the behavior of actual airborne time (AAT), i.e., the time between the wheels-off at the departure airport and the wheels-on at the arrival airport, which is the most expensive part of a flight, is also of critical importance.====The behavior of AAT is intertwined with other time components related to a flight. As shown in Fig. 1, AAT is part of the actual block time (====) of a flight which consists of AAT and taxi-out and taxi-in times. For a typical flight, taxi times are a small proportion compared to AAT suggesting a high correlation between AAT and ABT. In an ideal situation, ABT exactly coincides with the scheduled block time (====) of a flight and the actual and scheduled departure times match. However, in reality, ABT, which is influenced by taxi, en-route, and terminal delays, usually deviates from SBT. In some cases, flight operators may also try to reduce ABT below SBT to make up for departure delays. The difference between AAT and ABT stems from taxi-out time and taxi-in time. Gate-out delay is treated as the ground delay at the departure airport (====), neglecting the taxi-out delay. After arrival at the gate, the extent of after-flight turnaround time (====) plus arrival delay relative to the needed time for turnaround determines whether delay will incur to the gate departure of the next flight.====The time components involved in a flight described above provide some useful perspectives on what to consider when modeling AAT. The first important aspect is the extent to which AAT is in line with the flight schedule (OAG), which in turn is influenced by historic ABT of flights operating on the same OD and designed by airline according to their policy and schedule management. A closely related issue is how AAT is aligned with flight physical distance flown and its optimal distance path – great circle distance (GCD) route. Secondly, as on-time performance is a primary concern for airlines, an important factor to consider is the amount of time a flight spends before takeoff and whether pre-gate delay, i.e., the difference between the actual and schedule gate-out time, leads a flight to speed up or take a more direct route to make up for the delay within certain limits. Similarly, the amount of turnaround time between the actual gate arrival of a flight and the scheduled gate departure of the next flight may affect AAT of the flight. Anticipating a small turnaround time, the ability of a flight to shorten AAT to reduce arrival delay should be explored. Apart from the above, other flight operation-related factors such as aircraft heading direction (i.e., eastward and westward), hub status of departure/arrival airports, enroute and terminal congestion levels, and convective weather are also expected to exert some influence on AAT. In addition, AAT is likely to be further influenced by time-of-a-day, day-of-a-week, seasonal, and airport-specific factors.====To our knowledge, no prior research has looked into the behavior of AAT. Even the existing efforts to model ABT and SBT are limited. For ABT, Coy (2006) employed a two-stage statistical model with one-year flight records to estimate the block time of U.S. commercial flights. Factors chosen for ABT estimation include historical ABT, flight arrival time, airport utilization, ice, and the interaction of poor weather conditions with traffic. Deshpande and Mazhar (2012) used Ordinary Least Square (OLS) to estimate truncated block time, defined as ABT minus delay caused by late arrival at the origin of the departing aircraft, as a function of route, carrier, airports, airport congestion, and aircraft-specific variables. In a series of studies, the question of how the ABT distribution affects airline SBT setting considering flight on-time performance has been examined (Mayer and Sinai, 2003a, Mayer and Sinai, 2003b; Hao and Hansen, 2014; Kang and Hansen, 2017, 2018). Further research also looked into a related issue of whether delay as part of ABT is/can be internalized (Brueckner, 2002a; b, 2005; Brueckner and Van Dender, 2008). More recently, Fan (2019) investigated the variation of SBT over the past three decades using quantile and OLS regressions with air traffic condition, flight delays, aircraft type, flight heading, airports slot policy, airport-specific anomalies, airline-specific policies, and changes in crude oil price as explanatory variables. It is found that worldwide, SBT has grown by 0.21–0.33 min per year. Belkoura et al. (2016) discusses a computational framework to detect whether the actual trajectory is deviated from the planned trajectory. The airborne delay, the difference between ABT and SBT, can be calculated by the deviations with a hypothesis of a constant velocity.====In view of the existing literature, this paper aims to make two major contributions. The first one is the explicit modeling of AAT and testing of its relationship with a range of operation-, time-, weather-related and fixed-effect factors. In particular, we are interested in the extent to which AAT adheres to its OD-pair great circle distance (GCD) and which factors lead to more excess airborne time. Also of interest to us is the interactions of AAT with predeparture delay and after-landing turnaround time, given that the three-time components together determine delay propagation downstream. Large predeparture delay may pressure a flight to reduce AAT to catch up with the schedule within certain limits. Knowing that the turnaround time is small after landing, a flight may also try to reduce AAT to minimize arrival delay and its propagation to connected operations. These conjectures, which are unexplored previously, are part of the hypotheses to be tested in our study. Besides characteristics of OD pairs and delay prorogation, we have developed a great variety of variables from multiple datasets to include the impacts of traffic congestion levels and weather conditions at the terminals and en-route. Furthermore, how the AAT behavior evolves as a flight flies longer and as an aircraft flies more legs in a day is explored as well through sensitivity analysis.====For the second major contribution, our investigation of AAT behavior is conducted in a comparative manner for flights in the U.S. and China. From a management theory point of view, this paper is a benchmarking study that compares an important aspect of performance of the U.S. and Chinese aviation systems. Specifically, econometric analysis is performed to model the behavior of AAT of flights with focus on flight route efficiency, enroute and terminal congestion, convective weather and delay management. The air traffic systems of the two countries are the two largest in the world. The two countries are also similar in territory size, are both located in the belts of prevailing westerlies, and have significant flight delays (Ren and Li, 2018). Yet significant differences exist in their air traffic systems in terms of geographical distributions of air travel demand, airspace availability, air traffic flow management (ATFM), delay management policies by the respective civil aviation authorities, and airline scheduling practices. For the geographical distributions of air travel demand, most of the economic centers in China are concentrated in the eastern part of the country, resulting in the majority of flights being short- and medium-haul. In contrast, the economic centers in the U.S. are more evenly distributed throughout the country, with particular focus on the east and west coasts, leading to longer flight lengths (Fig. 2). In terms of airspace availability, only 20% of the national airspace in China is made available for civil aviation use while in the U.S. the percentage is 80%. This stark discrepancy means more limited airspace capacity and flight routing flexibility in China (Hsu, 2014). These differences make the comparison between the two countries worthwhile, so we developed the multivariate models for these two counties with the same specifications, the same feature engineering methodologies and the same or similar data sources to enable a counterfactual experiment. The results can roughly estimate consequence if China adopted the same air traffic control, airspace policies and procedures as the U.S. and thus possibly inform future flight scheduling and operation strategies in China to improve its system efficiency.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present model development and variable specifications. Section 3 describes the data sources and the data filtering process. Estimation results of the base models are reported and discussed in Section 4. Further sensitivity analysis of the estimation results to flight length and aircraft utilization is performed in Section 5. As we conjecture a more efficient flying environment in the U.S., Section 6 conducts a counterfactual analysis to assess the potential efficiency gains if the Chinese air traffic system adopted the AAT behavior in the U.S. Findings of the paper are summarized in Section 7 along with suggestions for future research.",Airborne flight time: A comparative analysis between the U.S. and China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001600,1 December 2022,2022,Research Article,51.0

ICAO (2021), however, forecasts a return to 2019 revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) by the year 2023 based on an optimistic (high) passenger assumption matrix, with the likely (mid) scenario being in 2024 while the pessimistic (low) level being at the year 2027. Despite the significant growth in passenger numbers pre -COVID-19 period, most airlines had difficulty having a profitable operation due to stiff and fierce competition in attracting and luring customers (Khan et al., 2019). Khudhair et al. (2019) reported that over 270 international airlines ferried over 3.8 billion people in 2019. With the pandemic, CAPA-Centre for aviation (2020) estimated almost half of the global airline companies would cease operations. To survive, such as in the current harsh environment, commercial airline operators must re-strategize and rethink repositioning their airline brands to mitigate the challenges (Thakshak, 2018).====As airline companies re-strategize, airline passengers are also increasingly becoming more aware of their rights towards their specific needs and tend to switch to other airline brands if one brand fails to satisfy their needs (Gupta, 2018). Given that air transport is a derived demand and highly perishable, airline companies must continuously align their services to the needs of both current and potential customers by going beyond the customers' expectations. Airline companies must constantly differentiate from the competition to enhance their competitive advantage (Khudhair et al., 2019). One way determined is to prioritize the development of a positive brand image and provide superior services that are not intended only to attract prospective passengers but also to retain the current set of existing passengers (Korkut and Arslan, 2010; Chow, 2014). To enable this, the presence of airline ==== is essential. These schemes provide reassurance from a financial standpoint in times of prosperity and also present airlines with a captive audience to reinvigorate travel interest that may assist in thrusting the airline brand out of times of uncertainty (Pascual and Cain, 2021) such as the pandemic. Therefore, it is more advantageous for an airline company to develop, sustain, and preserve long-term relationships with their customers through brand ==== than merely acquiring new ones as these passengers become emotionally attached to the airline company (Rafiq et al., 2013). Marketing statisticians term the cost of acquiring a new customer to be far much greater than that of maintaining an existing one, and a loss of customer base can damage the long-term development of a company as well as decrease its profits (Zhang et al., 2018).====Although competition by airline companies offers air travelers more choice options, the services offered, in essence, are the same: transporting passengers from one point to another. The only variability is in product/service, such as in; aircraft type, the number of stops/connections, departure, and arrival time, amongst others (Gao and Choy, 2019). Passenger airline companies should therefore position themselves to identify sustainable competitive advantages, deliver superior brand value to customers, and establish profitable customer relationships (Chen et al., 2019). Nonetheless, the understanding of a travelers' purchase decision and selection journey has been dictated as a challenge by commercial passenger airliners (Pels et al., 2009; Wu and Hanson So, 2018). It is, therefore, imperative to gain insight into a passengers’ travel preferences. Understanding the determinants of choice for air travel is critical in supporting airline planning decisions such as brand awareness, the brand perceived quality, and the drivers of the attitudes towards an airline ==== as passengers are deemed to make decisions based on these attributes. Consequently, passenger airline companies, air transport policymakers, and travel agencies need to understand passenger behavior vis-a-vis air travel clearly.====Grounded on Homans (1958) social exchange theory (SET) that asserts that, when ones are presented with choices, individuals will undergo subjective cost-benefit analysis and weigh available alternatives before making the final decision (Emerson, 1976). And following the SET principle, it is reasonable enough to assume that when travelers are contemplating and weighing to make a decision, a series of exchanges may ensue betwixt consumers and service providers that may lead to creating an opportunity for relationship building. The applicability of SET in choice behavior can be a valuable instrument, especially when analyzing traveller-airline relationships. The study's premise is the service industry, specifically commercial passenger airlines, given the intensive competitive environment in this market and the need to maintain close and long-term relationships. To remain relevant, branding is essential as it enables the airline's voice to be heard. Building brand awareness even before the end consumer boards the plane through advertising and word of mouth enhances the airline's reputation and recognition, leading to choice (Choe and Zhao, 2013). Additionally, having a better quality perception of an airline brand by a traveller improves the chances of the airline brand being selected (Chen et al., 2019; Shih-Ping, 2016) and may enhance the travelers' attitude towards the airline ====.====Despite the number of empirical studies that have been done on airline consumers' purchase decision, little, however, has be done to explicate and develop a theoretical understanding of the attitudes towards airline ====. This present study develops and tests a moderated conceptual model that investigates travelers’ attitudes toward ==== (====) as a regressand, regressor and a moderator in airline brand decision-making. The study contributes to brand equity and consumer purchase behavior literature by addressing critical potential research gaps. Two focal objectives are identified. The first objective specifics looks at the causal relationship that explores;====The second objective investigates the conditional effect of attitudes towards ==== In this case, the study objectizes that the attitudes towards ==== have a moderating effect on the link between;====The current literature does not explore the conditional effect of ==== in influencing airline choice. In response to this scenario, the present paper focuses on a single moderator effect, as depicted in Fig. 1 model II.",Airline brand awareness and perceived quality effect on the attitudes towards frequent-flyer programs and airline brand choice - Moderating effect of frequent-flyer programs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001612,29 November 2022,2022,Research Article,52.0

The models rely only on explanatory variables that airlines would know when they were planning their schedules several months prior to the actual flight. Historical Actual Block Time (ABT) data is collected for one-way flights in seven airport pairs in the domestic U.S. market for 2019. The variability of the ABT and its components for these airport pairs is presented. The main features that affect this variability are investigated. The results confirm that seasonality, aircraft type, departure/arrival hour, and airport congestion are significant variables in partially explaining ABT variations. Overall, the results show that the considered ML models have limited capability in predicting the ABT. The prediction accuracy of these ML models is compared against a benchmarking scenario, where the median value of the historical ABT is used as an estimate for the block time. It is found that the median-based approach provides better performance compared to the ML models. A sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the risk of flight delay against different levels of block time padding. The possible trade-off between the block time padding and the expected flight delays is presented. Finally, the study evaluates and compares different airlines' block time padding strategies in the different airport pairs. Results show significant discrepancies among airlines concerning setting the scheduled block time (SBT) in the same airport pair. However, it is difficult to confirm whether airlines are purposely adopting padding strategies, or they lack the ability to optimize their block time padding against expected on-time performance.","One core objective of airline schedule planning, besides maximizing profitability, is to develop a robust schedule that provides the best punctuality performance during operations (Zou and Hansen, 2012). The schedule of the airline includes the schedule of the flights and the schedule of the resources that support these flights (e.g., aircraft rotations, crew schedules, gate assignments, slots, ground operations, etc.). Flight schedule planning is typically performed several months ahead of its execution. At that time, schedulers typically lack information on many factors that would possibly impact the operational conditions of this schedule (Abdelghany and Abdelghany, 2018). One component of developing the flight schedule is to determine the scheduled block time (SBT) for each flight. The flight's SBT is the difference between its scheduled arrival and scheduled departure times. After its execution, each flight will have an actual block time (ABT) (also known as the gate-to-gate time), which is the total time the flight takes from pushing back from the departure gate to arriving at the destination gate. As shown in Fig. 1, the ABT is composed of the aircraft taxi-out time, airborne time, and taxi-in time (Deshpande and Arıkan, 2012). Taxi-out time is defined as the time between the aircraft pushback from the departure gate and its wheels-off time at the departure runway. The aircraft's airborne time is when the aircraft is in the air, which is the time elapsed from its take-off (wheels-off time) at the departure runway to the landing time (wheels-on time) on the arrival runway. The taxi-in time is the difference between the gate-in time and the wheels-on time. The taxi-out/taxi-in times depend primarily on the locations of the flight departure/arrival gate and departure/arrival runway, the congestion levels at the airport, and aircraft type (weight) (Lee et al., 2016). The airborne time depends on aircraft type, congestion in the air transportation system, and seasonality, which affects wind and other weather conditions.====The flight block time is crucial for setting up the flight schedule, aircraft rotations, crew schedules, gate assignment, airline fuel consumption and sustainability, and many other important decisions in schedule planning (Belobaba et al., 2015; Abdelghany and Abdelghany, 2016). The estimation of the flights' block time for the future schedule is a grueling stochastic problem. The error in estimating the ABT results in considerable costs to the airline. Overestimating the ABT represents an unexploited time for the resources of the flight (e.g., aircraft and crew). It also results in the early arrival of flights before their scheduled arrival time. In many cases, at congested airports, the gate and the ground crew are not ready to support the aircraft turn when the aircraft arrives before its scheduled arrival time. On the other hand, underestimating the ABT might lead to late arrivals (i.e., flight arrival delay). This late arrival might lead to passenger misconnections, poor on-time performance, and crew/aircraft schedule disruptions. Flight delays typically propagate in the network and cause additional downline flights to be delayed (Abdelghany et al., 2004a; Ahmadbeygi et al., 2010; Wong and Tsai, 2012; and Kafle and Zou, 2016).====Accurate predictability of ABT is difficult to achieve as the airline industry typically encounters several sources of uncertainty on the day of operation that, in many cases, disrupt and deviate the schedule from its planned version. These sources include irregular weather conditions, air traffic control constraints, and other unanticipated events. For example, heavy adverse wind on the day of operation may extend the airborne time of the flight. Also, the air traffic control authority can induce delays in case of unexpected heavy traffic volume while an aircraft is on the ground or in the air (Abdelghany et al., 2004b, 2007). Airline schedule planners typically have no information on these stochastic events when setting block times for future schedules several months ahead of their execution. Regardless, airlines seek out the best estimate for the SBT for each flight in their future schedule.====The process of estimating the SBT for future scheduled flights is almost consistent among most major airlines (Sohoni et al., 2011; Hao and Hansen, 2013a). The process relies on historical ABT data (or its components, including taxi-out, airborne, and taxi-in data). For each origin-destination pair, the data is clustered into similar flights based on several factors that might affect variability in historical ABT (or its components), including seasonality, aircraft type, and time of day. The way that these variables are used to cluster ABT observations may vary among airlines. The data elements that represent possible outliers are excluded based on standard deviation estimates. Then, the clustered data is used to set SBT while considering its associated reliability. The reliability of a selected value for the SBT represents the proportion of realized historical flights that has an ABT that is shorter than or equal to the selected SBT, which is known as ==== (Kang and Hansen, 2017). It is reported that airlines adopt an SBT that has a reliability of about 65%–75% (Hao and Hansen, 2013a). While this technique is widely adopted by most airlines, Sohoni et al. (2011) indicated that such techniques have not resulted in a significantly improved on-time performance of the schedule during operations. Thus, further analysis is needed to understand the relationship between the selected SBT and the expected on-time performance of the schedule for the different flights.====This study presents three different machine learning (ML) models to estimate the flight block time for commercial airlines. The models rely only on explanatory variables that airlines would know when they were planning their schedules several months prior to the actual flight. Historical ABT data (including taxi-out, airborne, and taxi-in times) is collected for one-way flights in seven routes in the domestic U.S. market for the year 2019. First, the variability of the ABT and its components for these routes is presented. Next, the main features that seem to cause this variability are investigated. Based on these models, the relative importance of these features in explaining ABT variations is confirmed. The prediction accuracy of these ML models is compared against a benchmarking scenario. The benchmarking scenario represents the case where the median value of the historical ABT is used as an estimate for the ABT. Next, the risk of having a flight delay is evaluated. Flight delay occurs when the ABT of the flight exceeds its SBT. The risk of a flight delay is evaluated against different levels of block time padding, where a few minutes can be added to the SBT to reduce the risk of having a flight delay (Fan, 2019; Forbes et al., 2019). The trade-off between the block time padding and the expected flight delay is presented. Finally, the historical SBTs for the different airlines are compared on each route. The goal is to assess the efficiency of the airline's schedule padding structure and its impact on their on-time performance.",The limitation of machine-learning based models in predicting airline flight block time,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001582,28 November 2022,2022,Research Article,53.0

On the one hand, time-critical and highly valuable goods need to be delivered as quickly as possible. On the other hand, cities are facing multiple problems regarding their transportation system, such as increasing congestion on the roads, and air pollution. To serve the demand of express parcels and at the same time oppose these emerging challenges, an airborne “green” ","Due to increasing urbanization and rising transport performance, road transport networks in metropolitan regions and cities all over the world are operating at their limits. This leads to a loss of air quality and quality of life in cities (World Health Organization, 2021), which partially result from road traffic (European Environment Agency, 2013). Meanwhile, the demand for goods to be delivered as quickly as possible is growing massively. Between 2013 and 2019, the number of global parcel deliveries worldwide has risen by almost 290% (Pitney Bowes, 2020). This trend is expected to continue and to pose growing problems for the logistics industry and the existing transport infrastructure.====Meanwhile, current research in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and corresponding new vehicle concepts capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) are driven by the technological progress regarding distributed electric propulsion (DES) and improved battery performance. VTOL aircraft might serve different use cases such as transportation of passengers, inspection services and transportation of goods. While passenger-carrying missions are expected to require an on-board pilot in a preliminary phase, inspection services and transportation of goods are intended to be carried out by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as “drones”. The transportation of goods by cargo drones is discussed to hold a great market potential, benefiting from the growing cargo and express cargo volumes (Baur and Hader, 2020). Cargo drones can serve different purposes including parcel delivery on the first or last mile, and long-range cargo transportation. The company Volocopter expects a market opportunity of $ 120 billion for their VoloDrone by 2035 (Autonomous Transport and Open Systems Association, 2021).====Looking at ground-based cargo delivery, last-mile delivery by cargo pedelecs is a concept that is already operated. Several cities installed city hubs as transshipment points to reload the parcels and goods from transporters to cargo pedelecs for the last mile. Additionally, these city hubs can be used as a parcel station for the final customer. In Western Europe, the projects “CITYLOG”, “SoWAS” and “Smarter Together10” represent new city hub concepts that were tested in large cities such as Berlin, Lyon or Wien within the last decade (Die Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, 2022; LNC LogisticNetwork Consultants, 2022; Smarter Together, 2022). In these concepts, the transporters still have to drive into the cities to deliver their parcels to the city hubs. To reduce the traffic on the road and still serve the demand, an airborne-supplied city hub can be a solution (Baur and Hader, 2020). In this case, city hubs need to fulfill several requirements to satisfy the needs of ground-based connection and urban planning on the one hand and flight operations on the other hand.====In this study, we outline the conceptual requirements of an airborne-supplied city hub that are related to ====, ==== and ==== Fig. 1. The requirements in this study are based on German law and have been generated by a document analysis as well as expert interviews. Appropriate conclusions were drawn from these analyses. However, the requirements for flight operations in particular can easily be transferred to other countries. Such requirements are based on international standards and regulations. For urban planning and road access, the respective applicable national law should be used as a basis. We establish the logistics concept in line with the following objectives: time- and resource-efficiency, appropriate dimensioning, compliance with aviation standards as well as the possibility for expansion.====This paper is organized as follows: After giving a brief introduction in this section, section 2 provides an overview of our literature findings regarding city hubs and drone delivery concepts. The third section presents our research context and the definition of an airborne-supplied city hub. Section 4 refers to the resulting urban planning requirements.

This paper explore causal nexus between air transportation and economic growth in BRICS countries by using balanced panel date for the period 1993–2019. Numbers of air passengers and air freight are used as measures of air transportation. Panel ,"Air transportation is one of the most significant inventions in transportation sector and is the fastest mode of movement of goods and people from one destination to others which help to save the time and enhance economic activities. Recent past several decades witness the tremendous evolution in aviation sector and air transportation infrastructure as well as services. Air transportation enhances the pace of economic growth through the development of different sub-sectors (Mehmood et al., 2015). Küçükönal and Sedefoğlu (2017) argued that air transportation sector boosts economic growth through direct and indirect effects. This system creates new employment opportunities, increase number of tourists, transfer goods through air cargo with rapid pace, improve international business opportunities and foreign direct investment. According to ATAG (2020), Aviation sector generated 3.5 trillion US dollar equivalent to 4.1 percent of the world’ gross domestic product (GDP) and provided 88.7 million jobs across the world in 2018. Around 58 percent tours traveled by air and 6.5 trillion US dollars trade occurred through air transport which is 35 percent of total world trade by value. However, like other services industry, seasonality prevail in air transport business (Merkert and Webber, 2018).====There are two important modes of air transportation such as; commercial air flights carrying passengers and air cargo services which used for transferring of goods. Commercial air flights help to open the new opportunities of investments, employments, tourism development and time saving mode for businessmen for expansions of international business and finding new avenues for business opportunities. Air cargo services help to shift high valued and short time span based perishable goods to distant markets and increase global supply chain (Kasarda and Green, 2005). Moreover, shipments of goods through air cargo services increase foreign exchange revenue which boosts economic growth (Chang and Chang 2009).====It is generally considered that there is significant correlation in economic growth and air transportation (Green, 2007; Zhang and Graham, 2020). However, literature on the causal nexus in air transportation and economic growth is limited and few studies are available out of which most of studies are on developed countries (Chang and Chang, 2009; Beyzatlar et al., 2014; Brida et al., 2016; Hakim and Merkert, 2016; Küçükönal and Sedefoğlu, 2017, among others). Some studies found unidirectional causality from air transport to growth (Brida et al., 2016; Tolcha et al., 2020). Whereas few researchers found one way causality from economic growth to air transportation and some found bidirectional causal linkage (Beyzatlar et al., 2014; Fernandes and Pacheco 2010; Chang and Chang, 2009; Hakim and Merkert, 2016). It is evident from literature that no census prevails in this causal nexus and directional of causality varied in different countries and regions.====A renowned block; BRICS consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. More than 25 percent surface of world covered by these countries whereas around 40 percent population of the world resides in these countries (Nassani et al., 2017; Doğanalp et al., 2021). Nassani et al. (2017) argued that these countries contributed more than 20 percent in the world's GDP. Recent past witnessed impressive economic development and growth in these countries (Hassan et al., 2020). Table 1 depicts the annual growth of air cargo, air passengers, air flights and GDP in BRICS countries and in whole block during 1993–2019. As far as individual countries is concerned, the highest annual air cargo growth rate exists in China and the lowest in Brazil during the same period. On the other side, the lowest annual growth rate in air passengers and air flights are observed in South Africa and Brazil and the highest annual growth in air passengers and air flights are seen in China and India. China enjoyed the highest and Russia faced the lowest annual GDP growth among BRICS countries. It is evident from this table that the highest annual growth is in air passengers followed by air cargo and air flights in these countries during 1993–2019 whereas annual GDP growth rate around five percent which can be called as an impressive growth rate during 25 years.====Considering hefty geographic, demographic and economic shares of BRICS countries in the world, the aim of this research is to examine long run and short run causality linkage between air transportation on economic growth in BRICS using panel data. The contributions of this study in the literature are as follows. Firstly, previous studies on the causal relation are mostly based on individual country level. Baltagi (2005) argues that panel data analysis provides more efficient and reliable results by controlling multicollinearity and individual heterogeneity in the data and providing more degree of freedom, thus panel data findings may be robust than time series results. There is no and or little evidence available on causal linkage between air transport and economic growth in BRICS countries using panel data, therefore, this is a novel study on this topic Secondly, individual country level studies e.g. Marazzo et al. (2010), Fernandes and Pacheco (2010), Yao and Yang (2012) used annual data up to 2006 whereas Hu et al. (2015) used quarterly data up to 2012. World air travelling has increased tremendously from 2.5 billion in 2008 to 4.6 billion in 2019 showing an increase of 84 percent (ICAO, 2020). Technological changes in air industry, entrance of new airlines and promotion of tourism have emerged significantly (Le & Nguyen, 2021). Maparu, and Mazumder (2017) argues that change in causality direction may occur with the change of economic reforms and political policies over the time. Thus there is a need of a fresh study employing the latest data. We used the latest available panel data (1993–2019) to explore whether causal relationship remains the same or not. Thirdly, this study applied two distinct panel causality; Vector Error Correction Mechanism (VECM) and Dumitrescu Hurlin tests approach for robust results.====The remaining parts of this study as follows. Significant literature is reviews in section 2 while methodology, variables and source of data are discussed in section 3.

Liberalization in the airline industry initially started in the U.S. in 1978 with the Airline Deregulation Act and then continued to proceed in Europe through different liberalization packages. As a result of the increasing competitive pressure, airlines started leveraging economies of density and network economies through consolidations and strategic alliances (Zhang and Czerny, 2012). The number of active carriers in Europe initially increased after the introduction of the first liberalization package, but then slowly started decreasing as the other packages were introduced. Driven by bankruptcies, take-overs, mergers, alliances, and code-sharing agreements, this became what is referred to as the “consolidation of the European airline industry” (Burghouwt and de Wit, 2015).====The introduction of the low-cost business model in the European airline industry contributed to this changing airline market structure. Initially, mostly regional airports were used as secondary airports in the low-cost carrier's (LCC) network. This typically resulted in these airports being dominated by one or several LCCs with significant market power (Červinka, 2017). However, more recently, LCCs are also becoming more interested in larger, primary airports, entering the battle area of the classical full-service carriers (FSCs) (Dziedzic and Warnock-Smith, 2016). This will in turn influence the airline market structures at these airports.====More recently the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is also affecting airline market structures. The pandemic has led to a sudden collapse in air travel, which has made a lot of airlines vulnerable to bankruptcies. In Europe, several airlines have already mentioned the COVID-19 pandemic as a contributory factor in their bankruptcy, such as LEVEL Europe, SunExpress Deutschland and Air Antwerp (CAPA, 2020; De Wolf, 2021). Since most airlines' survival mostly depends on state aid and growing debt, it is likely that more changes in the European airline market will follow. In this sense, COVID-19 could be a catalyst for further consolidation in the airline market.====Consequently, also European airports are facing a changing environment. Regional airports face fierce competition due to the more flexible point-to-point network strategies of the LCCs operating on them, while primary airports are strongly competing to attract the lucrative transit passenger. This is especially the case in Europe where the distances between airports are rather small, the presence of LCCs is increasing and alternative (and more sustainable) transport modes (e.g., high-speed railways) are becoming more popular (Bush and Starkie, 2014; Thelle and Sonne, 2018).====Besides, European airports are facing congestion problems. Eurocontrol stated (before the COVID-19 outbreak) that each summer about six European airports were operating near capacity for much of the day (Eurocontrol, 2018). They even estimate that this number will increase to between 16 and 28 airports in 2040, leading to an increase in flight delays from 12 min to 20 min on average per flight. Although the pandemic has caused a collapse in air transport demand in the short term, this remains a long-term threat for the air transport industry. Firstly, social distancing is becoming a standard in Europe, and this means that in airports, more capacity is necessary to transport the same number of passengers (Serrano and Kazda, 2020). Secondly, given the relationship between air transport and economic growth (Baker et al., 2015; Chi and Baek, 2013), it can be expected that once European economies are recovering from the pandemic, air transport demand will increase as well.====Given the vertical relationship in which airports and airlines cooperate (Ha et al., 2013; Hidalgo-Gallego and Mateo-Mantecón, 2019), the question arises how the market dynamics that take place in the airline industry will impact the airport's operations and vice versa. The trends taking place in the airline market are expected to change market structures: some airlines are increasing their market share and are becoming more dominant, while others are disappearing. For airports, it is becoming more important to make efficient use of their scarce infrastructure to cope with congestion and survive in the competitive environment. Therefore, this paper empirically examines the effect of airline dominance on the airport's technical efficiency. By gaining more insight into this matter, air transport policymakers can better assess the impacts of increased consolidation in the airline market on airports. For airline managers, this will help to determine whether their bargaining power will increase or decrease when they decide to organize (or expand) their operations on a specific airport.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review on the vertical relationship between airlines and airports, airline market structures and airport technical efficiency. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy used in the analysis. In section 4, more information is given on the data used in this research. Section 5 describes the results of the empirical model and section 6 summarizes the contributions of this paper, along with policy and future-research recommendations.",The effect of airline dominance on airport performance: Empirical evidence from medium-sized European airports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001363,11 November 2022,2022,Research Article,57.0

With condensed airline schedules and less options, air travelers must rely on making flight connections and manage layover times to arrive at their final destination on time. In an era with readily available information, passengers expect accurate and transparent reliability information to help improve decision making for multi-leg itineraries. However, often for reliability in air travel, this information is incomplete or not useful. In this paper we utilize historical probability distributions of flight arrival and departure times using publicly available data to give an intuitive and predictive flight itinerary reliability metric. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected air-travel in the US and this uncertainty is still being felt with cancellations and delays due to staff shortages and reduced demand. Therefore, we extend the stochastic network model from our previous research to air travel during COVID-19 to see the effects on flight reliability. Using this model, we conduct computational experiments to evaluate air travel through multiple reliability metrics. We show that during periods of high uncertainty, predictive historical distributions of flight data considering recency and seasonal effects are less accurate given many cancellations and a reduced flight schedule.","). Flight activity hit a record on July 25, 2019 with over 225,296 daily flights (====). However, the Spring of 2020 saw that record-setting pace halt in its tracks with projected industry losses of over half of its 2019 revenue and a drop of over 2.7 million passengers worldwide, a 60% reduction (====). However, passengers value risk-free and stress-free travel especially during times of great uncertainty. Strains on the airline flight network, staffing shortages, extreme weather, and regulations continue to hamper airlines and generate negative perceptions among travelers (====). As airlines attempt to rebuild customer trust when travel opens more in the upcoming years, it is important to highlight travel reliability from a traveler perspective that focuses on the entire passenger’s itinerary, including delays and the probability of a missed connection.====Research on the role that travel time reliability plays in transportation networks was popularized at the turn of the century with many researchers using probability distributions of travel legs to estimate network path travel time (====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Most developments in flight reliability research focus on the impact delays have on entire networks or airline schedules (====, ====). Recently, researchers have examined the impacts that a less busy flight schedule has had on reducing average flight delays in some countries during the COVID-19 pandemic (====, ====, ====). Our research extends this pandemic flight disruption investigation by looking at the entire passenger itinerary and the effect highly uncertain travel has on the reliability of that itinerary.====This paper examines the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on flight reliability. Specifically, we compare 2020 (rise of the pandemic in the US) and 2021 with 2019 flight reliability in the United States. We define reliability as the probability that a passenger is able to make it to their destination within a time budget and make all their connections along the itinerary. This reliability metric is further defined and calculated in Section ====. We show that in trying to find the most reliable flight itinerary (====), one can perform a network search algorithm whose objective is to maximize the aforementioned reliability metric.====Using this definition of reliability, we begin by comparing cancellations and delays between 2019 and 2020 for various itinerary characteristics, such as time of day and airport chosen. We show the large effect of cancellations in Spring 2020 and how the reduction in the flights scheduled caused less delays throughout the rest of the year. We then explore the effect that more cancellations and less available flights have had on itinerary travel time as well as reliability of that itinerary. Itineraries are more reliable, but some give up considerable travel time to achieve this reliability. Finally, we propose what amount of data to use for prescriptive analytics of itinerary decision-making based on reliability to give the passenger the most accurate measures possible. This predictive comparison between 2019 and 2020 show that using historically predictive distributions may give large errors during times of high uncertainty.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section ==== demonstrates how this reliability measure is calculated and the algorithm to find the most reliable flight itinerary (====). Section ==== outlines how we varied parameters and airports to design our experiments. Section ==== shows that the reliability results for different itineraries behaved differently during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous ratings.

This study proposes a model to explain a taxi time in an airport with influential factors such as airport weather (wind direction, wind speed, visibility, air pressure, precipitation), number of take-off and landing flights, number of aircraft moving in the moving area, runway occupation time for arrival, runway occupation time for departure, take-off and landing direction, and terminal location. In this study, the factors influencing aircraft movement are analyzed using data from Gimpo Airport and Jeju Airport in 2019. Result shows that taxi-in-time and taxi-out time are affected by wind speed, air pressure, and precipitation, especially among weather variables, the number of arrival flights by time, and departure flights before takeoff. The runway occupancy time, the take-off and landing direction, and the terminal location shows a significant factor to taxi hours. Gimpo Airport and Jeju Airport show a significant difference in taxi in and taxi out time. It is expected that these results can contribute to systematically and scientifically calculating aircraft flow while considering moving areas and weather.

Given rising air fuel costs, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to develop strategies to reduce fuel consumption at airports. It is necessary to study the factors affecting the operation of aircraft in the moving area. Factors affecting aircraft flow in airport areas may include airport weather (wind direction, wind speed, visibility, air pressure, precipitation), aircraft taking off and landing, the number of aircraft in moving areas, runway occupation time for arrival (ROTA), runway occupation time for departure (ROTD), and terminal location.====, CO, PM, and NOx emissions. For this reason, concerns about an increase in delays are growing.====The aircraft route refers to the route in the airport moving area using aircraft trajectory data recorded with airport surface detection equipment (====). Aircraft operating in airport moving areas contribute greatly to the combustion and emission of fuel at the airport (====). Taxi-in time refers to the time ranging from the landing time to the block-in time. Taxi-out time is the time obtained by subtracting the active off-block time from the actual take-off time.====Airport moving areas are divided into a maneuvering area and a movement area. The maneuvering area refers to the runway and taxiway area used for takeoff, landing, and ground movement of aircraft except for the apron. The movement area includes the apron and the aircraft station. All aircraft in the airport moving area move along a taxiway and a taxi line for movement, and all roads commonly used for aircraft movement are collectively referred to as taxiways.

Many strategies are currently being studied to reduce air pollution emissions in moving areas through departure and arrival plans and optimization of operations in moving areas. However, this strategy relies on accurate estimation of taxi-in and taxi-out times and understanding of the factors affecting taxi delays.====An airport is an important element of the air transport system in terms of traffic flow management. The continued increase in aviation demand is increasing the importance of reducing aircraft travel time at airports while maintaining aviation safety levels (====). As air traffic to passengers and cargo increases, flight delays continue to increase (====). Aircraft delays have a significant impact on air transport performance in terms of efficiency, cost, safety, and operation (====). Flight delays can lead to cancellation of flights or reduction in the number of available flights and can also reduce airline profits. Delays or cancellations of aircraft result in significant manpower time and cost at many airports (====). Due to increased demand for air transport and environmental disruption, on-time operations are becoming difficult.====It is necessary to calculate the slots systematically and scientifically. Slot refers to the total amount of operating time for an individual aircraft to arrive or depart, that is, the total amount of operating time. Airport capacity referrals to the minimum capacity among runway capacity, apron capacity, terminal capacity, and control capacity. Slot calculation based on the total number of aircraft that can depart or arrive per hour may vary depending on taxi time, weather, etc. However, the time traveled from the airport moving area due to restrictions caused by weather in addition to congestion of takeoff and landing areas, are not considered.====The efficient operation of the airport's aircraft moving area has a significant impact on the airport's profits as well as the efficiency of the entire airport operation. Although many studies have dealt with the efficiency of airport operations, few studies have analyzed the efficiency of airport operations from the perspective of ground moving areas. To improve the efficiency of airport operation, this study aims to propose a methodology for optimal solutions from the perspective of the ground moving area. Due to the poor flow of aircraft in the airport moving area, delays occur in the time from the main station to takeoff or the time to arrive at the main station after landing, causing problems such as increased fuel costs, passenger waiting time, and congestion in the airport moving area.====By applying taxi time to A-CDM(Airport Collaborative Decision Making), airport operators can improve on-time operation, improve gate and apron planning and management, passenger handling, reduce noise and carbon emissions, and ensure better traffic predictability, reduce workload.

Further, the formulation is inflexible enough to incorporate peculiarities of each real-world problem. Towards decreasing the problem complexity, allowing to incorporate several real features, a two-phase method is proposed.

To provide safe and efficient aviation, the International ==== Organization (ICAO) foresees that states’ members adopt several rules to standardize and guarantee civil aviation safety. To this end, it is incumbent on each nation to institute an Aeronautical Authority responsible for implementing and complying with international standards.====In Brazil, the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC, from the Portuguese “Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil”) is the ==== responsible for the regulation and oversight of civil aviation. Inspection within the scope of ANAC occurs through planned audits or activities on demand, such as continuous safety oversight and ramp inspection. The objective of audits is to verify the compliance of aviation service providers with regulatory requirements.====ANAC has approximately 1350 employees, including ====, contracted and outsourced. Of these, around 350 work directly in inspection. Regarding the universe of regulated organizations, there are over 234 airports, 450 maintenance offices, 10 regular air transport companies, 150 non-scheduled air transport companies, 240 aero-agricultural companies, and 325 approved training organizations. Most inspectors are based in the cities of Brasília, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, while service providers are located throughout the country in over 460 cities.====Considering that continental-sized Brazil has one of the largest aviation markets in the world, ANAC has a limited staff. Further, the Brazilian government’s budgetary constraints in recent years call for severe cuts in the expenditure of public organizations. In 2019, ANAC spent over 700,000 USD on daily allowance and air tickets to carry out inspection activities. Thus, considering the universe of regulated organizations and ANAC’s workforce, efficient inspection planning becomes necessary. Therefore, the challenge is to allocate resources for such an activity, reducing costs without affecting the quality of public services offered to society.====Staff scheduling consists of allocating employees to certain tasks over time (====). According to ====). Audit Scheduling consists of an optimization problem in which audit tasks are allocated to groups of auditors. Generally, the goal is to minimize the total assignment cost, considering constraints such as auditors’ time availability and the deadline for carrying out the audits (====).====In this paper, we develop an optimization approach for the Approved Training Organization (ATO) auditing, by considering both auditors’ assignment and aviation organizations’ arrangement to minimize the total cost of staff traveling. ATOs are pilot/crew schools spread across Brazil that are audited to verify whether they comply with national and international standards for aviation training. Each ATO should be audited by two multi-skilled inspectors ====. Due to the number and geographical locations of the ATOs to be inspected, it is one of the most time-consuming auditing tasks performed by ANAC. A model is proposed with a solution method, allowing its use during the audit planning phase. Modeling the problem of audit scheduling within the scope of ANAC allows us to analyze the business implications regarding the allocation of resources. From scenario analysis, it is possible to identify, for example, idle resources and more efficient ways to use the workforce. A case study was used to validate the model and to analyze the business implications of using the optimization approach. ANAC managers responded to the developed optimization approach positively, praising its flexibility and ability to capture different scenarios and parameters efficiently.====The main contributions of this work are (i) to propose a new formulation of the problem based on the Multi-Depot ==== problem (MDVSP); and (ii) to propose an efficient and effective algorithm that breaks the complex auditing personnel problem into simpler and easier to solve inter-connected sub-problems by capturing the problem peculiarities.

Several different types of ADD concepts have been defined, such as aerotropolis and airport city, but there are often substantial differences between authors about definitions. Such differences can potentially create confusion when ADD concepts are used by airport planners in their planning documents (e.g., master plans) and the marketing materials (e.g., brochures and airport websites). Given that large amounts of investment can often depend upon the marketing of a particular ADD concept, such confusion is highly problematic for the air transport ====. However, previous research has not explicitly addressed this issue. To help fill this research gap, the current paper has four different purposes, to: (1) compare definitions of the airport-driven development concepts in the academic literature, (2) compare definitions with real-life examples given by researchers; (3) compare academic definitions and examples with industry usage, as found on airport websites and in airport planning documents; and (4) investigate aspects of the transferability of the ADD concepts (from one region to another and from the academic literature to the industry and vice-versa). Using information from airport websites and master plans, it was found that the terms aerotropolis and airport city are used interchangeably by researchers but not by the industry. However, the use of terms by the industry depends heavily upon the (continental) location of airports, with the analysis presented in the paper distinguishing between airports in North America, Latin America, South and East Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Such analysis enables conclusions to be made about the transferability of ADD concepts, originating in the Global North, to the Global South.","Since the beginning of the 21st Century, airports have increased their relevance, particularly as a potential tool for fostering economic development on a local, regional, and metropolitan scales. As mentioned by ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In particular (====; ====; R. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), described that list of six concepts Airfront, Decoplex, Airport City, Airport Corridor, Aerotropolis and Airea. According to ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Among these ADD concepts, the aerotropolis (ATP) and airport city (AC) concepts are the most common terms presented and discussed in academic literature (====). “Airport city is associated with the growth of economic activities around airports because of their dependence upon airports (see ====; ====; ====) […]” (====, ====). A common definition developed by Kasarda is the airport city as the core of the aerotropolis and followed by other authors (====; ====; ====; ====). However, this idea appears not to be the same as for others. When defining the aerotropolis concept, authors sometimes do not even mention the airport city concept and vice-versa (====; ====; ====; ====). Even so, there is no consensus about their definition in academic literature (====, p.8; Fernandes ====, Liou et al. (2018p. 11)), or they are used indiscriminately (====. This is confirmed within this paper (i.e. one author's is an aerotropolis, and one author's is an airport city). ==== has a list of 84 airports defined by him as airport cities or aerotropoli (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====If there is a lack of clarity in the academic world, there is likely to be a lack of clarity in the non-academic world (e.g., airport strategy documents or on airport websites). The hypothesis was “the conceptual confusion of the ADD concepts in academic literature would influence industry airport planning”. This could be a problem because ADD schemes need a huge amount of money (====; ====), and if it is poorly conceptualized, it could be wasted. Furthermore, ADD concepts arose from North America and Europe (====; ====; ====; ====), and it is likely to be a particular issue when they travel to the Global South (GS). The way the ADD concepts travel is still in its infancy, particularly regarding Latin American & the Caribbean regions. One example of travelling concepts from the GN to GS is mentioned by ====: “the international diffusion of the aerotropolis concept and its application for planning airports and urban development” spread to the African continent.====Therefore, there are four different purposes of the paper: (1) to compare definitions of the airport-driven development concepts in the academic literature, (2) compare definitions with real-life examples given by researchers; (3) compare academic definitions and examples with industry usage, as found on airport websites and in airport planning documents; and (4) To find out aspects of the transferability of the ADD concepts (from one region to another and from the academic literature to the industry and vice-versa). By reaching each aim as mentioned above, this paper contributes to academic terms because it demonstrates the existence of the conceptual confusion and flexibility of the ADD concepts, particularly about the airport city and aerotropolis concepts, in academic literature. Additionally, this paper shows a gap between the way researchers classify airports and how airport planners elaborate their strategic plans. It suggests that the academy does not interfere in planners' planning their airports and surroundings since it seems they plan according to their will and interests. Further, in terms of management implications for the industry, mapping where airports are located and how they classify themselves can generate an idea of clusterization and give them ways to try to stand out from other airports and regions.====This paper is organized into six sections: it starts with this Introduction, followed by Section ==== Methodology, which explain how the research was undertaken by each aim.

","From a global point of view, various researchers evaluate travel and tourism in different countries. Tourism is a leading economic growth factor for developed and developing countries. According to growth theory, economic growth is related to (1) high intensity of R&D and high productivity; on ==== large scale. In general, countries with high tourism do not share these characteristics. Contrarily, the tourist industry does not require much technological advancement, and countries specializing in tourism are typically small (====). Tourism booms trade, which increases growth and welfare. Tourism involves the trade of goods and services between countries. Tourism exports have increased 11 percent in recent decades (====). Trade links with the transport sector because it creates opportunities for an increasing mode of transportation and shifts goods and services, promoting people-to-people connectivity (====). A well-designed transportation system promotes economic growth and transportation at a low cost, reducing production costs. Tourism arrival is one of the country's significant drivers of economic growth (====).====However, there is a significant need to focus on other transportation modes closely related to tourism, such as railway transportation, travel, transportation systems, etc. The tourism sector's contribution to global GDP is up to 10.3% through direct and indirect activities. It also improves market integration and raw materials logistics and facilitates tourism. Improvement in transportation infrastructure will lead to efficient resource allocation, a better business environment, and efficient international trade (====). Government spending on transportation infrastructure is advantageous for foreign direct investment, generating employment and tourism (====). However, the connection between transportation infrastructure and economic growth is vice versa (====). There are gains from the agreement over infrastructural developments among the nations; these developments lead to enhancement in technology and trade liberalization. Trade liberalization will lead to cost-effective production among nations and, ultimately, economic growth in the country (====). Employment opportunities get towering with the construction of highways, tunnels and, railways etc. (====).====At the inception of the Belt and Road initiative in 2013, 65 counties joined the BRI; after passing the years, these countries expanded (====). As of January 2021, 140 countries are listed on the online portal of the BRI. China plans to develop a network of infrastructure projects connecting Asia, Africa, and Europe through the BRI countries to foster a global trade system. Connectivity, including infrastructure, is a critical component of the global economic transition (====). By 2018, Chinese companies had invested more than $90 billion (in 2018 dollars) in countries along the BRI and had completed more than $400 billion in foreign planned projects for countries along the route (====). Only a few latest studies, such as ====, examined whether BRI promotes the tourism economy. BRI has increased 17.2% inbound tourists and generated inbound tourism revenue by 8% in the Belt & Road countries. However, this study ignored transportation. So, I fill this gap with more economic variables. Although the BRI has had a considerable influence on the regional travel and tourism industry, few systematic empirical studies have evaluated the impact of the BRI on tourism and transport development. As a result, this study fills a research gap by assessing the extent to which BRI influences tourism development and contributes to the elements that influence transportation development.====), such as international tourism arrivals, tourism receipts from passengers, tourism receipts from travel items, tourism receipts from current US dollars, and tourism receipts percentage of exports for the inbound tourism index, and the outbound tourism index included international tourism expenditures, international tourism expenditures from passengers, international tourism expenditures from transport items, and tourism expenditures from travel items. In addition, this study included air transportation, railways transportation, travel services, transport services, and trade openness to estimate the impact on international tourism in 140 BRI countries from 1996 to 2020.====This work's main contribution is finding a relationship between inbound and outbound tourism, transportation, and trade in BRI countries. In previous studies, there is a gap in investigating the relationship between inbound and outbound tourism with transportation infrastructure in BRI countries. The deficiency in the previous study motivates further analysis. The research questions are; what is the impact of air and railway transportation on inbound and outbound tourism? Does the long-run relationship exist between tourism, transportation, and trade openness in BRI countries? Is there causality between inbound and outbound tourism, transportation, and trade openness in BRI countries? We utilized principle component analysis (PCA) (====) to find the inbound and outbound tourism indexes to achieve the first goal. To achieve the second goal, we utilized fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) analysis. For robustness, we utilized dynamic common correlated effects (DCCE) (====Our paper related to the broad empirical literature on air transportation, railway transportation travel services, transport service, and trade openness (====; ====). In particular, some studies have looked at the effect of transportation and economic growth (====; ====). This literature mainly focuses on tourism and transportation growth with the effect of trade openness; as such, it is mainly on the country and cross-country levels. In contrast, we divide tourism into inbound and outbound and link our study with air transport and railway transport. By doing so, we also have a substantial debate on trade openness. In comparison, air transportation and railway transport impact economic development in the region (====). Such as transport links with economic growth and trade openness (====). We differ in that group. Our approach allows a causal relationship between air and railway transportation and trade openness on inbound and outbound tourism. Our results highlight the potential effect of inbound and outbound tourism in BRI countries. In the first step, we estimate the air and railway transportation variables separately with dependent variables of inbound and outbound tourism to check the long-run relationship between the variables. We estimate all these variables together. It shows a positive long-run linkage between inbound and outbound tourism with air transportation, railway transportation, and trade openness.

However, due to the inherent spatial and temporal dependencies of air traffic flow and the irregular sector structure in which flow operates in, it is still a challenging problem. To solve this problem, numerous methods are proposed considering airspace adjacency, while flight routes and the origin-destination dependency are not taken into account. In this paper, we propose a temporal attention aware dual-graph convolution network (TAaDGCN) to predict air traffic flow, in which the airspace structure and routes of flow are both included. Firstly, a complementary spatial dual graph convolution module is constructed to capture the dependencies of adjacent sectors and origin-destination (OD) sectors. Then, to include long path information, a spatial embedding (SE) block is adopted to represent potential related sectors of flight traversal. Furthermore, to characterize temporal evolution pattern, a temporal attention (TA) module is applied to access past features of input sequence. Based on the blocks stated above, a spatio-temporal block is constructed in which multiple spatial and temporal dependencies are covered. The experimental results on real-world flight data demonstrate the proposed method can achieve a better prediction performance than other state-of-the-art comparison methods, especially superior to the methods that ignore the sector spatial structure.","With the rapid economic development, the demand for air traffic in many fields has greatly increased (====; ====). However, there is a growing conflict between the rapid growth of air traffic demand and the limited capacity of the air traffic management (ATM) system, which further contributes to airspace congestion and flight delays. (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). These problems give rise to higher requirements for air traffic flow management (ATFM) (====; ====). Efficient air traffic management decisions are dependent on accurate air traffic flow prediction. Air traffic flow prediction (ATFP), as the core technology of ATFM, can provide decision-making basis to formulate effective management strategies, which has received increasing worldwide attention (====). Accurate ATFP enables air traffic controllers to be aware of the trend of air traffic flow, which is significant to flight safety assurance (==== et al., 2020).====Air traffic flow prediction can be divided into four levels from the perspective of the prediction area: sector, route, route points and airport (====). Since air traffic controllers manage flight in units of sectors, we mainly focus on the flow of sectors in this paper. In the recent years, massive efforts have been made to solve the problem (====; ====; ====). Related ATFP studies can be roughly divided into two categories: the model-driven approach and the data-driven approach (====; ====; ====). The model-driven approach formulates traffic problems by constructing a model, which requires complex system programming and high computational complexity, especially when the number of aircrafts has increased significantly (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, these methods neglect the complex actual environment in air traffic, which can not capture spatial correlation of different regions, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance. Considering the air traffic flow of different regions is closely related, some researchers attempt to encode the air traffic flow into a traffic flow matrix (TFM), and model the spatial and temporal dependencies by convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) (====; ====). Although spatial dependencies are considered in these methods by modelling air traffic as a grid matrix, it is not suitable for flow prediction of airspace sectors which have irregular topology. In addition, there are still shortcomings in modelling the long-term temporal dependencies.====In summary, the ATFP performance in existing researches is still far from satisfactory, mainly due to the following challenges:====Based on these above observations, we propose a temporal attention aware dual-graph convolution network (TAaDGCN) to predict air traffic flow across airspace sectors, which can capture the spatial dimension dependencies and the temporal dimension dependencies. To efficiently model the irregular structures of airspace sectors, a dual-graph module is specifically designed for the characteristics of air traffic flow, i.e., the adjacency graph and the origin-destination (OD) graph. Since air traffic network has irregular topologies which can be well modelled by graph convolutional networks, but how to construct the graph is an open problem. Existing strategies of constructing graphs are not suitable for flight data. Therefore, we construct a dual-graph structure combining the characteristics of air traffic and integrate it into the graph convolution, which is called dual-graph strategy including adjacency graph and origin-destination (OD) pair graph. To characterize the evolution of temporal information, we employ a temporal attention (TA) module. In addition, to combine the characteristics of long paths in air traffic, TA module is implemented after concatenating the input history flow and the spatial embedding (SE) based on path. Specifically, the proposed spatial embedding (SE) block encodes sector nodes as vectors that preserve the long path information. To take multiple spatial and temporal dependencies into account, a spatio-temporal block (ST block) based on the dual-graph module and the attention module is designed, in which two complementary graphs are incorporated into the graph convolution to capture complex spatial dependencies, and an attention mechanism is adopted to efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies. Overall, our model follows the encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder encodes the input traffic features and the decoder predicts the output sequence. Between the encoder and the decoder, there is a transform layer, which is used to transform the time dimension of the hidden features. By stacking the ST blocks in the encoder-decoder architecture, multiple spatial and temporal dependencies can be effectively modelled.====To optimize above network, the objective function is defined, which maximizes the log probability of the neighborhood ==== for a node ====, given by ====:====where ==== is a mapping function, ==== is node set.====To make the optimization problem tractable, conditional independence assumption and symmetry assumption in feature space are defined.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reported a 25.81 percent to 71.78 percent decrease in the number of flights from March 2020 to December 2020 compared to the last year (====, ====, ====). Airlines are required to take prompt action to accommodate the outbreak situation to ensure the health and safety of passengers (====). The International Air Transportation Association (IATA) medical advisory group suggests social distancing measures, also introduced as physical distancing, among passengers to reduce the chance of infection. This measure includes sufficient distancing among passengers while seated, during check-in, and through the boarding process (====). World Health Organization (WHO) and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) also emphasize the importance of social distancing measures to reduce the rate of transmission among people who share the same activities (====, ====). According to the instruction published by EASA, “airplane operators should ensure, to the extent possible, physical distancing among passengers”. Some recent studies stressed that the ideal practice of social distancing among passengers require a well-defined seating assignment methodology as well as the willingness of passengers to practice social distancing guidelines (====, ====).====, ====, ====, ====). For example, if passengers’ luggage is distributed evenly in the cabin, boarding time can also be reduced (====).====Our research makes two new and important contributions. First, we provide a theoretical approach by developing a model that accounts for seat assignment and passenger boarding sequence, considering the utilization of the capacity-limited overhead compartment. This is a significant contribution, as recent studies emphasize the relevance of physical interactions for the virus transmission (cf. ====, ==== and ====, ====). We focus on outside-in boarding sequence, which has already been evaluated as very efficient since it eliminates unfavorable passenger interactions within the seat rows (window seat is boarded first, followed by the middle seat and aisle seat). However, we will also show that our approach leads to a significant improvement in general cases (random boarding sequence).====As the overhead compartments become more utilized during boarding, passengers must put in the additional physical effort to first rearrange the luggage in the compartment to make room for their own luggage. Second, with respect to a methodological contribution, we researched the combination of optimization and simulation approaches to handle the aircraft boarding problem under COVID-19 requirements, providing the optimized seat allocations and boarding sequences. Here, the proposed mixed-integer programming (MIP) optimization problem provides a solution for passenger seat assignment. Given the high complexity of the MIP problem, we develop a genetic algorithm to obtain near-optimal solutions. Finally, the stochastic and agent-based simulation approach determines and evaluates appropriate passenger boarding sequences based on the given seat assignment.====The paper is structured as follows. After providing a relevant background in the literature review (Section ====), we introduce our optimization model for the seat assignment problem in Section ==== assuming an outside-in boarding sequence, which already reduces additional passenger interaction during seating. In Section ====, we design a genetic algorithm to solve the NP-hard seat assignment problem.

The resulting seat allocations are input for the following agent-based simulation approach, which is used to determine the appropriate boarding sequence (Section ====), considering passenger interactions, virus transmissions risk, and the increased utilization of the overhead during the boarding progress. In our approach, we have not yet implemented a feedback loop from the sequence optimization to the seat assignment model. This will be part of future research work.

Findings reveal that the foremost aspects are location and costs, whereas the most crucial factors are airport charges and handling charges. The study suggests that airports should follow a low-price policy for airport-related charges without compromising their sustainability to have a share of the increasing number of air cargo flights, especially during the COVID-19 period, when airline passenger flights are decreased. The study is crucial in deciding the strategy and policy of air cargo carriers and airports during the pandemic period.","). The sharp decline in demand for passenger flights with the adverse effects of the pandemic has forced almost all airline companies to land large numbers of passenger aircraft. Hence, the loss caused by the pandemic only for 2020 has reached approximately 492 billion dollars. This figure corresponds to 60% of 2019 revenues and it is estimated that air traffic will not reach 2019 figures before 2024 (====). Moreover, the inability to use the belly capacities of passenger aircraft has caused the air cargo industry to suffer a severe loss of capacity despite the increasing demand for cargo. Despite the significant increase in the demand for air cargo transportation, which is the most preferred mode of transportation for urgent needs due to the speed advantage, with the onset of the pandemic, the sector has difficulty in meeting the demand since air cargo carriers have had capacity constraints in terms of limited aircraft in their fleet. According to the report published by IATA in May 2021, the capacity in the air cargo sector is still 14% lower than in 2019 due to the lack of belly cargo capacity. Surprisingly, there is an increase of approximately 10% in the load factor and 50% in the yield compared to normal due to the rise in productivity. As a result, the sector has grown by more than 4.4% compared to the pre-crisis 2019 March figures. This has provided revenue from air cargo, which used to account for around 10–15% in the past, to account for roughly one-third of airline revenues by 2021 (====).====Some airline companies, looking for ways to respond to the increasing air cargo demand due to the pandemic, have started to provide cargo transportation services with some wide-body aircraft that they have grounded to meet the cargo demand and tolerate the loss in passenger income. It is seen that this method, which is applied by some traditional airlines such as Lufthansa Airlines and Turkish Airlines, has a positive effect on the sustainability of these airlines. The figures stated in the 2020 annual report of Turkish Airlines demonstrate this positive effect as an example. According to the report, Turkish Airlines achieved a 61% increase in cargo revenues by using the 50 passenger aircraft that was grounded as a ""preighter (derived from passenger and freight)"" despite the 66% decrease in passenger revenues due to COVID-19 in 2020 (====). However, there is a different case for air cargo carriers that only perform scheduled and non-scheduled cargo transportation. The sudden increase in air cargo demand resulted in carriers seeking to create additional capacity supply but unable to find cargo aircraft. This necessitates the effective and efficient use of existing capacities for the sustainability of these carriers to meet the cargo demand from different routes. In the decision-making process, the adequacy of the airports on the routes where the demand comes from is also essential for the carriers. Further, rival airports on the same routes should also master the factors critical for carriers in this catastrophic process to take the largest share of this capacity with the right policy and strategy.====In this context, the study aims to present proposed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework that will enable air cargo carriers to make strategic choices among potential airports in evaluating demand from various routes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, five main aspects and their 18 factors are obtained from the literature and experts. Afterward, the aspects and factors are prioritized by analyzing with the triangular fuzzy Dombi-Bonferroni mean operators-based best-worst method (TFDBM-BWM) model using data gathered from decision-makers during COVID-19. The study is unique and vital since there is no other study in the literature that deals with the decision of airport selection in terms of air cargo carriers for the pandemic period and it has the quality to provide insight into this decision of strategic selection that carriers make for their sustainability in the era of COVID-19. The study is also expected to provide foresight for air cargo carriers to increase their revenues and market shares by enabling them to use their capacities effectively and efficiently during the pandemic.====Dombi and Bonferroni mean operators can easily manage the interactions between the elements for flexible decisions. ==== argued that consolidating those operators by triangular fuzzy numbers is an effective way for the group decision-making process. BWM, developed by ====, is also an effective and practical MCDM technique with fewer pairwise comparisons than other subjective weighting methods and can achieve more consistent results. Since triangular fuzzy numbers can model ambiguity satisfactorily (====), it is a scientific view to integrating the Benforonni and Dombi operators with triangular fuzzy numbers to cope with challenging multi-criteria problems. As a result, the primary motivation of this paper is to develop the TFDBM-BWM methodology under uncertainty, which is the first time in the literature, to reveal the relative weights of evaluation factors more accurately. Furthermore, this work has the following targets:====Providing flexible group decision-making, allowing interaction between factors, and eliminating the effect of useless data are the key advantages of the TFDBM-BWM methodology. Motivated by the above issues, below highlights some contributions and novelties of the paper.====The remaining sections of the article proceed as follows: A literature review on airport selection and the fuzzy BWM (F-BWM) method are presented respectively as a subsection in Section ====.

Business aviation is defined as ‘==== (ICAO, 2018).====The importance of the sector cannot be neglected as it adds value significantly to several business efficiencies (e.g., travel time savings translated into productive time, reduced night stays for business travels, etc.), travel comfort, improved regions’ connectivity and societal life-saving services (e.g., medical evacuation services in remote areas, fire rescue operations, transport solutions for areas without scheduled airline service) (Pazourek, 2011; DLR, 2016; EBAA, n.d.). Notably, existing reports have stressed the role of business aviation on specific economies, e.g., 0.2% of the combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (€19.7 billion annual gross value added) of European Union, Norway and Switzerland (PWC, 2008) and $5.8 billion of the GDP of Canada (InterVISTAS, 2017).====The outburst of COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, has affected air traveling in all regions across the world. In May 2020, the European business aviation performed its lowest levels of flights (−71%); subsequently, however, it rebounded strongly and in May 2021 the sector's performance was only at −10% in terms of flights, compared to 2019 levels (EBAA, 2021). In the post COVID-19 period, the search for sanitary protection from COVID-19 transmission might push wealthy leisure travelers to more frequent use of private jets. The very emergence of mobile apps such as Jet Linx and NetJets using features of the sharing economy has added to the popularity of business aviation (Papatheodorou and Poulaki, 2022).====Although several literature reviews on air transport topics exist (see Ginieis et al., 2012; Spasojevic et al., 2017; Bellizzi et al., 2020; Wang and Gao, 2021), nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no such review has been conducted on business aviation research. We have identified business aviation on the basis of the private jets’ business model while research on all business-class airlines or business class cabin travellers in traditional carriers has not been included. As a result, the objective of this paper is to identify the existing literature on business aviation; overview and classify the related scientific papers; stress the existing gaps and provide guidance for further research. More specifically, the following research questions are addressed:==== What is the publishing trend of business aviation-related publications?==== Which authors, affiliations and location countries of them have contributed to business aviation research?==== What are the influential journals in business aviation research?==== What are the most frequent keywords used in scientific business aviation literature?==== What are the research topics that have been studied by the researchers about business aviation?====The paper is organized as follows.

Interestingly, along with the growth in international tourism, the number of tourists traveling to Taiwan has increased from 3.63 million to 8.44 million from 2000 to 2019 (Tourism Bureau, MOTC, 2019). Therefore, the quality of service for tourists has gained attention along with increasing demand for tourism information.====Within this competitive environment, providing exceptional service quality is a success strategy (Parasuraman et al., 1985; Reichheld and Sasser, 1990). Moreover, maintaining appropriate communication with the customer could improve service quality (Parasuraman et al., 1985). Most importantly, the needs of customers are to be recognized and understood (Gronroos, 1982). As the hospitality industry is customer-oriented, providing positive service quality is essential for better performance (Chien and Chi, 2019; Ekiz et al., 2006; Farooq et al., 2018; Gallarza and Saura, 2006; Hong et al., 2020; Izogo and Ogba, 2015; Ladhari, 2009; Namukasa, 2013).====Travel service centers (TSCs) or visitor information centers have transformed from being travel advice providers to becoming critical promoters of the country's tourism policy.

Wong and McKercher (2011) indicated that the staff in visitor information centers are the primary source of travel advice for tourists; further, providing appropriate information can reduce the transaction cost of travel (Merkert and Hakim, 2022). Hence, the quality of advice has an enhancing or restraining effect on the overall travel experience as hospitality and service quality play a critical role in the first impression on tourists.====This study aimed to identify the primary service quality attributes of TSCs at international airports in Taiwan, including Taoyuan International Airport (TPE), Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH), and the international terminal of Taipei Songshan Airport (TSA).

Since the COVID-19 health crisis has unprecedentedly influenced airport regulations and operations, effective measurement of ASQ has become crucial for airport administrations. Surveying travelers' attitudes is useful for ASQ assessment but collecting responses could be time-consuming and costly. Therefore, this paper adopts a data-driven crowdsourcing approach to study ASQ during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating Google Maps reviews from the 98 busiest U.S. airports. To do so, this study develops a topical ontology of keywords regarding ASQ attributes and uses a sentiment tool to derive passengers' attitudes.

Additionally, the effect of ====, ====, ====, and ==== on ==== significantly differs between the two periods. The findings illustrate the effectiveness of leveraging online reviews and offer practical implications for what matters to air travelers, especially in the COVID-19 context.","As the connection between passengers and the sky, airports are an indispensable component of the air transportation network (====). Today's passengers demand more extraordinary airport service and are inclined to choose alternative modes of transport once unsatisfied (====). Airports have become highly competitive brands that compete at various levels to attract travelers. In particular, service quality is the determinant for airports to fulfill passengers' needs and influence their intentions to revisit (====). Therefore, airport administrations need reliable information to comprehend passenger expectations about airport services and accordingly facilitate improvement programs (====; ====).====Airport services have multiple dimensions and attributes, each of which has varying degrees of impact on passenger satisfaction (====). Due to large indoor gatherings, airports have become vulnerable places with health concerns about the potential hazards of human-to-human transmissions (====; ====). As a result, passengers seek a cleaner and safer environment than in the past, reinforcing airport quarantine procedures and forcing airport administrations to accommodate such situations (====). These changes can affect travelers’ behaviors and feelings about airport services, such as complaining about queues for temperature checks or sanitation conditions in restrooms. This complex and competitive environment has raised two questions for evaluation strategies: (1) how to understand and measure the key attributes of services that drive passenger satisfaction, and (2) how to explain the changes after the COVID-19 outbreak and allocate resources to thrive airport business.====For the first question, as ==== described in their study, prior studies have used surveys to investigate a representative sampling of passengers’ viewpoints about airport service quality (====; ====; ====). While conventional survey techniques can help obtain insights into airport service quality, collecting responses could take tremendous time and resources. Another significant hindrance is the difficulty of covering a sizeable geographical scale with respondents from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. For the second question, very few studies so far have investigated the changes in customer satisfaction in terms of airport service attributes since the COVID-19 pandemic.====Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) and online platforms (e.g., Google Maps) have been increasingly indispensable for people to communicate opinions and feelings (====). These platforms set up a virtual channel that disseminates information faster, broader, and less constrained by social and geographical restrictions (====). Crowdsourcing through online platforms presents a novel source for service providers to investigate service quality. This approach has been implemented to measure customer satisfaction with products and services in multiple domains, such as hotel administration (====), restaurant management (====), and airport service (====; ====). However, it provides rapid and geographically distributed information from a large population that may complement conventional surveys.====Nevertheless, dealing with this abundant and ever-increasing amount of online data, consisting primarily of unstructured texts, requires effective and efficient techniques to extract information (====, ====). Multiple studies have demonstrated the potential of using NLP and machine learning techniques to analyze customer reviews (====; ====; ====). Building on the existing body of knowledge, this study applies a lexicon-based sentiment tool to investigate Google Maps reviews of the 98 busiest airports in the U.S. This study examines the airport service before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and identifies areas for improvement. It further offers insights into the changes in airport services and proposes several suggestions for airport administrations to consider.====A list of 98 airports is presented in ====. It includes the following information: (1) rank (based on the number of reviews downloaded from Google Maps review), (2) airport full name, (3) airport code, (4) airport location, (5) enplaned passengers in 2019 based on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (====), (6) hub type based on Federal Aviation Administration data portal (====), (7) pre-COVID-19 rating (calculated based on Google Maps reviews from the pre-COVID-19 period), (9) post-COVID-19 rating (calculated based on Google Maps reviews from the post-COVID-19 period), and (10) whether upgraded during the study period (based on information collected from online news).====The upgrade status of airports is based on authors’ judgment on related news reporting on the upgrade of infrastructure or layout in airports. For example, the Department of Palm Beach International Airport reported multiple facility improvement projects to the infrastructure airport, such as terminal roof and escalator replacement (====). In this case, the upgrade status is identified as “Y” in ====. The upgrade status is also identified as “Y” if there is an ongoing renovation to an airport. For example, Fresno Yosemite International Airport has expanded its terminal by adding two gates and a baggage makeup system (====). If no news or reports are available online relative to the renovation during the study period, then the status is identified as “N.” As a result, 37 airports upgraded their infrastructure or layout for better service during the study period. The sentiment increases for some airports after the COVID-19 outbreak, as reported in Section ====, could result from airport renovations. For example, the LGA has shown a significant sentiment increase since the COVID-19 outbreak (====), possibly resulting from several major modernization millstones in recent years (====).",How has airport service quality changed in the context of COVID-19: A data-driven crowdsourcing approach based on sentiment analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972200117X,9 September 2022,2022,Research Article,81.0

These measurements are adopted to assess the variability of air traffic over time and across the route network of low-cost carriers (LCCs) in Europe and the United States and to estimate the impact of seasonality on fleet utilization. Using panel data for nine LCCs in Europe and the United States from 2004 to 2017, we find that higher seasonality results in lower fleet utilization after controlling for stage length, network size, aircraft size, and fleet standardization. Moreover, we find that seasonality is negatively associated with spatial and climate zone diversification of airline route networks. These results suggest that airlines may be able to reduce seasonal traffic variability through diversifying their networks geographically and consequently mitigating the negative fleet utilization impact.","Demand for air travel is derived from demand for activities such as business, visiting friends and family, and tourism. Because demand for tourism and holiday travel tends to be seasonal, air transport demand by leisure and vacation travelers also tends to vary seasonally. However, airline capacity, particularly the fleet and employee components, has limited flexibility within each seasonal cycle. Balancing demand and capacity poses a major challenge for airlines with significant seasonal markets. Airlines have adopted different strategies to deal with the seasonal demand. While peak load pricing can contribute to management of demand fluctuations, some airlines, e.g., Ryanair and easyJet, offer only seasonal services to certain airports in their network, and may park “surplus airplanes” during the off-peak season. In contrast, other airlines, such as Southwest, are more cautious about the airports they serve, and minimize or even avoid serving seasonal airports==== in their networks.====Anecdotal evidence indicates that Ryanair grounds about 20% of its aircraft during the low-season months in a typical year, leading to a lower annualized fleet utilization than other low-cost airlines including its archrival, easyJet. Based on daily airline schedule data from OAG, Reynolds-Feighan (2018 & 2021) calculates the system-wide seasonality at airports in the three years of 1996, 2006, and 2016, and finds the presence of lower seasonality (measured by Gini Index Scores) in the United States as compared to Europe and other regions. Moreover, Reynolds-Feighan (2018) provides an in-depth study investigating the regional carrier operations in the U.S. air travel market and finds that regional carriers play a significant role in helping the mainline airlines mitigate seasonality and achieve higher fleet utilization as compared to airlines in other regions of the world.====Although there has been a movement toward hybridization of airline business models in the recent years (Birolini et al., 2022; Morlotti et al., 2020; Klophaus et al., 2012), our exploratory analysis of European airline schedules indicates that there is relatively little seasonality in terms of scheduled seats among the traditional full-service network carriers (FSCs), which is consistent with the findings of anna.aero (2015). On the other hand, scheduled flights/seats for low-cost carriers (LCCs)==== tend to show significant seasonal variations. This may be explained by the fact that LCCs continue to focus largely on leisure travelers with seasonal demand and generally operate in the short and medium haul markets. With the continued expansion of LCCs, it remains unclear how the route network structure unique to many LCCs impacts the seasonality they may experience. Moreover, as many LCCs, such as Ryanair, easyJet, and Allegiant Air, have targeted and entered tourism routes including destinations that are particularly popular during holiday seasons, the impacts of seasonality on airline performance are of significant importance to airline management. This paper focuses on seasonality and fleet utilization of LCCs in Europe and the United States.====Using panel data for nine LCCs over the 2004–2017 period, we quantify both the temporal and spatial dimensions of airline routes and traffic dispersion patterns over time and across the route network using three alternative seasonality measures. The traditional Gini index and our proposed Concentration Index focus on the temporal dimension of seasonality, whereas our proposed SES Pooling Index incorporates the spatial as well as temporal dimensions of traffic variability by measuring the aggregation effect across all airports in an airline's network. Furthermore, we use ==== values to depict climate diversification of airline route networks in order to analyze their effects on air traffic seasonality. This paper addresses two key research questions: (1) How does the geographic and climate diversification of LCCs' route networks affect their traffic seasonality? and (2) What are the effects of seasonality on airlines' fleet utilization? Our empirical results suggest that higher seasonality results in lower fleet utilization, and seasonality is negatively associated with spatial and climate zone diversification of airline route networks. While these findings are drawn in the context of LCCs in Europe and the United States, the implications are also relevant to full-service airlines that have pivoted their route network toward leisure travel markets during the COVID-19 pandemic period.====Our study contributes to the aviation seasonality literature in three aspects. First, we develop two alternative seasonality measures describing the temporal-spatial characteristics of air traffic variability. Second, we empirically explore the potential relationship between climate diversification and airline seasonality. Finally, we find empirical support for the effects of seasonality on airline fleet utilization.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on seasonality, focusing on how it is measured.

These risk management systems are simple and focused but handicapped by their deterministic view of hazards and risks. They cannot understand a hazard’s behaviour in a complex, socio-technical system such as airports. They also suffer from probative blindness during their risk assessment and accord prominence to high severity and high-frequency risks and tend to neglect low frequency but high severity risks known as “Black Swans” as improbable. Moreover, they view risks from the regulators’ perspectives rather than from the airport operators and often discount their business continuity risks. To overcome these limitations, this work proposed an integrated risk management method that can help an airport operator to manage complex risks at the organisation’s level. It uses subject matter experts’ brainstorming to identify compound hazards and associated risks. It prioritises risks based on the existing mitigations and their effectiveness. The results section demonstrates this method’s usefulness by applying it to day-to-day scenarios in an airport. In conclusion, this proposed method can help an airport operator to identify complex risks and manage them in an effective manner. This is a simple to use, cost-effective, and user-friendly method. Airport operators can implement it to manage risks with a holistic view with no significant changes to their existing organisational structure. Since this method has a generalized process, any organisation can use it apart from airports. This method’s usefulness depends on qualified subject matter experts’ availability. A field trial with an airport can help this method to gain acceptability with the operators and regulators.","Airports accommodate interactions of various stakeholders such as airliners, air navigation service providers (ANSPs), ground handlers (GHA) and regulators to enable safe transport of passengers and cargo. They also create employment opportunities and improve tourism potential. Thereby boosting their local economies in a significant manner. Airports multiplier effect on the economy can even influence the economic growth at their national level (International Civil Aviation Organisation, 2005). In this situation, any disruption to an airport has the potential to affect not only the constituents of the airport systems such as ANSPs and GHA, but also the elements outside this system. Vice versa is also true. This makes them a complex sociotechnical system (Serrano and Kazda, 2018). It is a fact that complex systems exhibits emergent behaviour that can be different from their constituents’ behaviour (Bar-Yam, 2020), making them unpredictable. This means their risks are also unpredictable and complex. Airports are no exception to this. Therefore, a risk management system that has deterministic view about hazards and assumes linear behaviour from their risks may not suit airports.====Currently, airports have several domain specific risk management systems (DSRMS). Some of them are mandatory such as occupational health & safety, and operational safety, while some are voluntary such as financial risk management systems. These risk management systems offer focused approach to manage risks that are specific only to their domain. This is because their risk's definition is a restrictive and mutually exclusive one. For example, health and safety risk management systems consider anything that affects people's well-being as a risk. However, they will not consider anything that cause aircraft damages as a risk. Similarly, aviation operational risk management systems consider anything that affects aircraft and their operations as a risk, but factors that can affect people such as muscular-skeletal disorders of aircraft ground handlers are not risks. Thus, DSRMS encourage various departments of the same organisation to operate in a “Silo-Like” environment without appreciating their interrelationships. This makes then unsuitable to manage risks with an overall organisation's perspectives.====This work aims to propose a novel risk management system with the ability to identify compound hazards and assess their complex risks with a suitable decision making tool. This suits more to a complex system such as airports (Serrano and Kazda, 2018) rather than DSRMS. The following section describes the limitations of DSRMS. Section 3 describes the integrated risk management systems' attributes that forms the bedrock of the proposed method. Section 4 describes the proposed method. In Section 5, it is applied to four typical scenarios that may happen to any aerodromes. Discussion about the proposed method's characteristics, its advantages and limitations follows in section 6. Finally, this work concludes with the future work needed for this method to earn acceptance among the airport operators.",A novel Integrated Risk Management Method for Airport operations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001156,1 September 2022,2022,Research Article,83.0

The North and Northeast regions are furthest from the efficiency frontier, which can be interpreted as offering important investment opportunities.","The relation between air transport and tourism has been extensively researched, leaving no doubt as to the causality between these two segments of the economy. Papatheodorou (2021), Spasojevic et al. (2018) and Zhang and Graham (2020) have published reviews of studies in this field, which point up reports of international institutions in these two areas of the economy that ratify this relationship. Local and regional studies also demonstrate the relation (Fernandes et al., 2021; Dobruszkes and Mondou, 2013; Tsui et al., 2021; and others). Accompanying the international studies, reports by Brazilian organisations, including the Brazilian airline association (ABEAR) and Ministry of Tourism (MTur), have advanced robust arguments on causal relations between air transport and tourist flows (ABEAR, 2020; MTur, 2021). Accessibility is of major importance to the development of tourism and air transport (Duval, 2013) in that it can greatly expand the prospective catchment area for the tourism market in each region. Tourism's performance in taking advantage of this relation with air transport in Brazil has not been explored in depth to estimate the regional potential of tourism in the light of air transport flows.====Every locality is enhanced when, among other things, an airport is built, an air link established or a hotel set up. If successful, these enterprises yield benefits for all concerned. The notions of productivity and efficiency are well accepted as fundamental to business success. However, they are not being explored in the broader sense of locality; in this case, a tourist region. This study of a sample from Brazil, sought to gauge relative efficiency, which could be attributed to the various stakeholders operating in that tourist region or who could be operating there and are not. Implicit in the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is the concept of imitation of best practices or best examples.====This paper reports on a dynamic analysis of potential employment, establishments, and international and national visitors, in terms of gaps to the efficiency frontier, in the light of air transport flows in Brazil's tourist regions (RegTur), which is a group of municipalities. The analysis rests on statistical inference and the Malmquist data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. Of the 330 tourist areas registered with the MTur, those with at least 300 paid domestic air transport passengers in 2019 were selected, resulting in 88 tourist regions (Annexes I and III) with data for two years (2016 and 2019). The focus on these two years responded to the fact that MTur released more detailed statistics on tourism for those years. Gaps observed in the tourist regions will indicate investment opportunities, primarily considering Brazil's favoured situation in the world context as regards natural and cultural resources. The analyses revealed gaps in both international and national tourism, pointing to realistic prospects for each of these businesses. The study examined the concentration in the economy and in tourism activities in Brazil's leading tourist regions; that trend is at odds with the need to develop hinterlands in a country with marked regional differences. This paper shows a new way of using DEA analysis, which is the use of this method to estimate the demand potential of a decision-making unit (DMU), instead of analysing the productivity of the DMU. In this way, instead of looking at inputs as factors of production, they are defined as demand drivers. Otherwise, the study uses the concept of idle capacity, used in productivity analysis, to represent the lost potential for tourist demand, the lost potential for job creation and the lost potential for creating companies by the Brazilian tourist regions.====The paper is organised into topics. Following this Introduction, to outline the context of the study, topic 2 presents a brief literature review, commenting on studies of the use of DEA in examining the field of tourism. Topic 3 describes the analytical methodology chosen to frame the analyses. Topic 4 presents the salient aspects of the Brazilian case. Topic 5 describes the results from applying the methodology. Topic 6 discusses the findings. Topic 7 summarises the conclusions and recommendations.",A dynamic analysis of air transport and tourism in Brazil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001168,1 September 2022,2022,Research Article,84.0

We consider design of skyport locations for air taxis accessing airports, where we present the skyport location problem as a modified single-allocation p-hub median location problem integrating choice-constrained user mode choice behavior. Our approach focuses on two alternative objectives ====, maximizing air taxi ridership and maximizing air taxi revenue. The proposed models in the study incorporate trade-offs between trip length and trip cost based on mode choice behavior of travelers to determine optimal choices of skyports in a city. We examine the sensitivity of skyport locations based on two objectives, three air taxi pricing strategies, and varying transfer times at skyports. A case study of New York City is conducted considering a network of 149 taxi zones and 3 airports with over 20 million for-hire-vehicles trip data to the airports to discuss insights around the choice of skyport locations in the city, and demand allocation to different skyports under various parameter settings. Results suggest that a minimum of 9 skyports located between Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn can adequately accommodate the airport access travel needs and are sufficiently stable against transfer time increases. Findings from this study can help air taxi providers strategize infrastructure design options and investment decisions based on skyport location choices.","Major cities around the world are currently struggling with a common problem: traffic congestion resulting from urban population growth and limited roadway capacity. Spikes in travel time across congested routes in a city can have unpleasant consequences, ====, not reaching the airport on time to catch a flight or delaying emergency vehicles in delivering a critical patient to a medical center. Such concerns have pushed the development of new higher speed transportation modes to avoid surface congestion altogether. eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) vehicles, also known as electric ‘air taxis’, are emerging as a promising option to improve urban mobility. While helicopter services have been around for quite a long time in various metropolitan areas, (==== New York City, Los Angeles, São Paulo), the concept of urban air mobility (UAM) or advanced air mobility (AAM) for passenger transportation is focused on providing on-demand shared mobility using technology-efficient, less noisy, affordable, environmental friendly and potentially automated aerial vehicles (==== air taxis). While air taxi services have not yet been launched in any major city, multiple industry groups (including air manufacturers, large private companies, and smaller start-ups) are actively working on projects to offer such services in the next few years (====, Uber, Hyundai, Toyota, EHang, Volocopter, AirBus, Boeing, Lilium Jet, Terrafugia, Joby Aviation, Kitty Hawk and others).====In 2016, the transportation network company Uber released a comprehensive white paper (Holden and Goel, 2016) with a follow-up technical document (UberElevate, 2018) discussing their view on requirements of urban air taxis to make UAM feasible as an affordable solution to commuters. It is estimated that producing high volumes of safe and reliable air taxis would drive down passenger costs per trip (Hornyak, 2020; Holden et al., 2018). Furthermore, various technology requirements and regulatory steps associated with on-demand aerial mobility have been discussed by NASA (Holmes et al., 2017; Johnson and Silva, 2018); these include the use of distributed electric propulsion, concept vehicle design, power and energy requirements, noise and emission reduction, safety, and reduction in operation and energy costs. In past years, major brands and other eVTOL start-ups have made tremendous progress towards making the UAM concept a reality (Downing, 2019; Glon, 2020). NASA signed Space Act Agreements with 17 companies in the aviation industry to conduct full field tests in urban environments. The UAM Grand Challenge (Hackenberg, 2019) by NASA is the first in a series of technology demonstrations aimed at evaluating different elements of UAM operations under various weather, traffic, and contingency conditions. A first version of an UAM Concept of Operations was released by the Federal Aviation Administration (Bradford, 2020) providing an initial road map on achieving high volume and safe urban air taxi operations. Such active interest and serious funding supporting air taxi projects is indicative of its (potential) widespread adoption in the near future.====Identifying the UAM market and understanding customers' preferences for on-demand eVTOL services is the primary consideration for planning UAM operations. As a preliminary assessment of the impact of air taxi services, several groups conducted surveys and analyses. For example, Rothfeld et al. (2018b) confirmed via simulations that the reduction in travel time may strongly influence the adoption of air taxi services. Another survey conducted by Airbus (Thompson, 2018) spanning three regions (New York City, Frankfurt and Shanghai) indicated that airport access/transfers are the best use case for UAM adoption by commuters. Similar investigation by other studies including Berger (2018); Goyal et al. (2018); Hasan (2019); Shaheen et al. (2018) suggests airport transfers as the most promising early market for UAM technology; this market could extend to include other urban commute trips as the density of demand for UAM increases with increasing fleet size and service area coverage (Goyal et al., 2018). Some recent studies that focus on the use case of airport access via UAM investigate business model options (Straubinger et al., 2021), economic feasibility (Lewis et al., 2021), demand estimation (Rimjha et al., 2021), and flight scheduling (Roy et al., 2022) of UAM services. The white paper by Uber (Holden and Goel, 2016) identified infrastructure development as a key challenge in enabling efficient UAM operations. In their paper, the term ‘skyport’ or ‘vertiport’ denotes the ground infrastructures required for air taxi operations (====, boarding, alighting of passengers, eVTOL charging, take-off and landing operations). The air taxi service is multimodal in nature ====, the end-to-end trip would mainly involve use of ground transportation to and from the skyports (Goyal, 2018). Kreimeier et al. (2016) found that the willingness to pay for such on-demand aviation services is greatly affected by the first mile and last mile ground transportation distance. Thus, location of skyports based on travelers' choices might be a crucial factor in the overall adoption of this emerging mode of transportation.====Our study draws motivation from the key findings in the above studies. We focus on the problem of planning the ground infrastructure for air taxi services for airport access/transfers in an urban city. In particular, we incorporate travelers' preferences for UAM services to determine optimal skyport locations in an urban city with an objective of providing economically sustainable solutions to air taxi service providers. Given a large city with multiple candidate skyport locations, it is non-trivial to select a small subset as skyports that attracts all customer groups with different preferences, especially when the location choices and users’ decisions of using air taxi services are closely interrelated.",Air taxi skyport location problem with single-allocation choice-constrained elastic demand for airport access,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001132,30 August 2022,2022,Research Article,85.0

During winter, the use of de-icing agents to restore pavement skid resistance may also cause chemical damage to the pavement surface and produces Foreign Object Debris (FOD). The asphalt binders at the pavement surface are also susceptible to oxidative aging when they are exposed to high temperatures and cyclical heat and moisture (An et al., 2021; Kandhal and Chakraborty, 1996; Lu et al., 201 5; Omranian et al., 2020). Hence, airport pavements require systemic inspection at planned intervals and timely repairs for aircraft safety. At busy airports, pavement repairs are usually carried out during off-peak hours to minimize disruption to the aircraft maneuvering areas. Because of the limited repair window, it may not be possible to rectify some non-critical pavement distress within the available time. Currently, repairs are prioritized according to the severity of pavement distress using a simple rating scale (FAA, 2014a), and the repair hours are estimated based on experience or expert judgments. The accuracy of such assessments depends on the traffic environment, the repair technologies, and improvements in pavement design and materials. Hence, this paper proposes an improved method to forecast pavement repair hours that uses technical change, pavement condition, aircraft traffic, and rainfall, including their lagged values, as independent variables. Technical change is modeled as an exogenous variable that changes over time. Because of endogeneity, the structural feedback equations are estimated using the Vector-Autoregressive (VAR) modeling method (Floyd, 2005; Triacca, 2014; Trinh, 2018). The model is tested using five years of monthly data (60 observations per variable) collected at Changi Airport for asphaltic airport pavements in tropical environments. The major findings are that technical change, the lagged value of pavement condition, and the change in aircraft traffic do not explain why the repair hours are increasing over time. The main determinants of repair hours are rainfall and previous repair hours. Since the monsoon periods in Singapore coincide with the holiday seasons, more pavement distress is likely to occur due to the combined damage of traffic loads and the presence of excessive moisture.","Asphaltic airport pavements are difficult to maintain because they are often damaged by the cyclical loads from aircraft and specialized maintenance services vehicles and atmospheric impacts due to the regional climatic conditions (Chen et al., 2019; Horonjeff et al., 2010; Sulejmani et al., 2020). During winter operations, the use of de-icing agents to restore pavement skid resistance may cause chemical damage to the pavement surface and produces Foreign Object Debris (FOD). The asphalt binders at the pavement surface are also susceptible to oxidative aging arising from exposure to high temperatures and cyclical heat and moisture (An et al., 2021; Kandhal and Chakraborty, 1996; Lu et al., 2015; Omranian et al., 2020). The loss of adhesion to the pavement aggregates and the erosion of pavement surface result in pavement cracking, raveling, and fretting. However, if the design of the pavement structure and thickness conform to standards (FAA, 2021), the risk of suffering structural failure is reduced unless the damage is caused by freeze-thaw cycles or high-water tables.====Pavement repairs are usually carried out during off-peak hours (FAA, 2014c), and the length of the repair windows normally depends on the level of traffic. Pavement repairs such as pothole patching, milling and patching of large areas, and sealing of pavement cracks are common. Moreover, pavement resurfacing is normally carried out at regular intervals, such as every four to seven years, depending on the pavement condition and the availability of the maintenance closure schedules. Other pavement maintenance activities, such as the removal of aircraft tire rubber deposits and repainting pavement markings, are also carried out for aircraft safety and compliance with the regulatory requirements (ICAO, 1984). Hence, many concurrent maintenance activities are taking place within the same maintenance closure and at the same pavement section. Consequently, some of the non-critical pavement distress may not be rectified within the available time.====To better manage the repair resources and ensure the pavement condition for aircraft safety, airports often prioritize pavement repairs based on the severity of pavement distress using a simple rating scale (FAA, 2014a; ASTM, 2020). The estimated pavement repair hours are often based on experiences and expert judgment. In general, the maintenance of airport pavements requires several steps (FAA, 2014c; Haje et al., 2011), namely.====Pavement performance is often predicted using simple regression, extrapolation, or expert judgment methods (Baladi et al., 2017; Sharaf and Hai, 2016). However, these methods neglect the effects of pavement repairs and other variables. Hence, this study proposes an improved model that considers technical change, pavement condition, aircraft traffic, and rainfall, including their lagged values as independent variables in the simultaneous equations model. Technical change is modeled as an exogenous variable that changes over time (Tan and Elias, 2000). Because of the endogeneity between pavement condition and repair hours, the vector-autoregressive (VAR) modeling method is used to estimate the equations (Floyd, 2005; Triacca, 2014; Trinh, 2018).====The pavement repair hours refer to the maintenance downtime between the pavement closure and the opening of the affected pavement to aircraft traffic. This study does not examine the methods of assessing pavement distress severity, prioritizing pavement repairs, and formulating pavement maintenance strategies. Also, the findings are limited to the asphaltic pavement in tropical regions.",Forecasting airport pavement repair hours,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001028,30 August 2022,2022,Research Article,86.0

GSE (Ground Support Equipment) operators participate in many of those events. It is necessary to manage the personnel properly to minimize such occurrences. This paper aims to develop a general method for determining the minimum training level at which the risk of causing an accident in air traffic is acceptable. The analysis was inspired and illustrated by a real-life minor aviation incident. The study consists of determining the risk of the transformation of this event into an accident. For this purpose, in the article, we use an innovative method of accident risk assessment based on an expert system. Due to the necessity of considering many subjective parameters, mainly related to human behavior in a complex system, we used fuzzy inference systems. The developed expert system with a hierarchical structure allowed to describe both the actions of the participants of the event and their consequences, depending on the ground handling personnel's performance. As a result, the determined risk correlated to the transformation of the selected incident into an accident. Finally, the sensitivity analysis determined the minimum level of the GSE operator's training. This paper presents the application of the developed expert system. It showed that the training of the GSE operator plays a crucial role, for example, in a situation wherein environmental conditions, such as the surface condition or visibility, were unfavorable.","The rapid development and continuous air traffic growth require actions in various areas to maintain safety at an acceptable level. In the case of staff most responsible for traffic safety, such as pilots of aircraft or air traffic controllers, aviation organizations emphasize the recruitment process with thorough and regular training and constant supervision over current activities. The aim is to limit human errors that may lead to aviation incidents.====International regulations define three types of aviation occurrences: incidents, serious incidents, and accidents (ICAO, 2020a). For this work, the analysis of possible effects of actions and the category of accidents is expanded based on their impact, adopting the following scale:====Ground handling personnel also undergo appropriate training, not only in terms of the specificity of the activities performed but also for the general awareness of safety issues in airport traffic. In many countries, shortages in the labor market, high turnover, and frequent employee changes occur. This forces ground handling agents to limit the requirements for job applicants, increase flexibility in assigning tasks, and conduct rapid training to fill the shortage in positions. This may increase the risk in operational work with an inappropriate selection of employees for the tasks.====According to the latest Eurostat data, in 2016, 1,032 companies were operating in the aviation industry in Poland, employing 14,500 employees (Polityka Insight i Baker McKenzie, 2019). Despite the increase in the number of companies and the systematic turnover increase, the number of employees fluctuates around 15,000. The Polish government plans a new transport hub investment, creating over 100,000 new jobs. One of the biggest challenges will be the quality of the ground service dependent on employees who are currently not on the market (Polityka Insight i Baker McKenzie, 2019).====It is impossible to train an operator to ensure that they will not cause any hazardous incidents in airport traffic. It is essential that it only remains at the incident level (that is, the event without material damage and injured persons) and is not transformed into an accident. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the risk associated with the performance of a specific operator, which may support the process of flexible personnel management.====The hypothesis for this work was based on analyzing a real-life minor aviation incident involving a piece of GSE equipment operator. The study aimed to determine the risk of transforming an incident into an accident and consider the operator's level of training, general psychophysical predispositions, and the ability to perform specific activities in each position. Taking the approach stated, barriers can be identified that worked to prevent an accident. Moreover, through simulation experiments, observations can be done to indicate the validity of how effective these barriers are on the level of employee training. These, in turn, will determine the minimum training level required at which the risk of an accident in a situation like the analyzed one remains tolerable.====Knowledge related to human behavior in the workplace and the risk of making mistakes is uncertain and difficult to describe objectively and precisely. Therefore, it is reasonable to use methods that describe the dependencies adequate to the uncertainty. In this work, used are fuzzy inference systems. The construction of such a system allows for the formal description of imprecise expert knowledge through fuzzy rules. Produced was a fuzzy inference system with a hierarchical structure that will determine the variability of participants' actions and the effects of the event selected for analysis, depending on the ground handling personnel performance. As a result, it was possible to identify and assess an incident into an accident transformation risk that aviation organizations can use for effective human resource management.====More generally, the subject of this work is to develop a methodology for analyzing the risk of the transformation of an incident into an accident, considering the human factor by building an expert system. Using fuzzy inference systems to assess the risk of making a mistake allows us to identify safety barriers that failed and those that worked in each case and did not lead to an accident.

The aircraft maintenance ==== (AMRP) generates aircraft routes to serve scheduled flights, while satisfying the strict maintenance requirements. However, in operations, the pre-determined aircraft routes are usually disrupted due to unplanned maintenance requirements or insufficient remaining legal flying time to maintenance stations. Thus, airlines often have to re-route aircraft in real time. This study proposes a new aircraft re-routing approach to fulfil the maintenance requirements arising in the operational stage. Specifically, maintenance stations are capacity-constrained, while airlines could allocate maintenance resources (like staff and equipment) to other airports with additional costs. Besides, flights could be re-scheduled (i.e., cancelled with a high penalty), while the model endeavors to minimize the impact of recovery actions on the original plan. To achieve this, specialized flight networks are constructed, and a column generation-based algorithm is developed to obtain high-quality solutions within short computational times. Computational experiments show that the solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm are optimal or near-optimal with an optimality gap of 0.3% on average. In addition, some managerial insights on allocating maintenance resources to other airports to fulfil aircraft maintenance demands in operations are discussed.","The airline scheduling problem is often decomposed into four sequential problems (Jamili, 2017; Munari and Alvarez, 2019; Wen et al., 2020, 2021): flight scheduling, fleet assignment, aircraft maintenance routing, and crew scheduling (Sun et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2022). Aircraft is the core resource of an airline which should be properly planned to ensure that the strict maintenance requirements would not be violated when serving flights. The aircraft maintenance checks vary across countries and airlines (Jamali et al., 2021; Shaukat et al., 2020). For instance, Liang et al. (2011) state that many U.S. airlines require a daily check for every 24–60 flying hours, including a walkaround inspection and checks on lights & emergency equipment, etc., while Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposes an A check for every 60 flying hours (Barnhart et al., 1998a). Typically, from a tactical planning perspective, the AMRP prescribes that aircraft can follow a cyclic path and visit a ==== (i.e., an airport with qualified manpower and sufficient equipment to conduct the corresponding maintenance check) on a regular basis to fulfil the maintenance requirement.====However, the aviation industry is full of uncertainties. Many unplanned events force airlines to modify their pre-determined tactical aircraft routes in real operations (Kammoun and Rezg, 2018; Yetimoglu & Akturk, 2021). For instance, bad weather or accidents during previous flights, unplanned mechanical failures, or emergency maintenance checks required by airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and authorities all impose unexpected maintenance requirements which are not planned in the tactical planning stage. Besides, disruptions like flight delays and traffic congestions lengthen flight flying times (Chung et al., 2017; Khan et al., 2019a, 2019b, 2021). Thus, the pre-determined aircraft routes may become infeasible as there is no proper maintenance opportunity for the unexpected requirements or an aircraft could not arrive at the scheduled maintenance station in time. Thus, airlines often have to re-route aircraft in daily operations to fulfill maintenance demands while covering the scheduled flight as much as possible. To be specific, airlines usually apply automatic recording systems to keep track of the real-time status of each individual aircraft. When the remaining legal flying time reaches a certain threshold, the aircraft will be labeled as a “====” aircraft. Then, in the recovery procedure, the high-time aircraft will be re-routed to proper maintenance stations to carry out maintenance checks (Sarac et al., 2006). However, maintenance stations are often capacity-constrained in various aspects, like available man-hour, parking slots, available equipment. Eltoukhy et al. (2018) point out that the maintenance resource availability constraint is a major factor which affects the feasibility of an aircraft routing plan. Conflicts between the workload assigned to a maintenance station with its capacity are commonly seen in the industry, which is even more severe in the operational stage as many unforeseen maintenance requirements arise day by day. To ensure the travel safety and avoid the high penalties of violating maintenance requirements, many airlines would allocate maintenance resources (like staff and equipment) to other airports with high costs (named as the ==== in this study). That is, if a high-time aircraft is expected to finish its duty at a maintenance-infeasible airport (either an unqualified airport or a qualified airport with insufficient maintenance resources), the airline will send a team of qualified personnel with sufficient equipment there.==== The maintenance team can be sent (allocated) to the prescribed airport by any means, like moving along with the flights operated by that aircraft. However, adopting the SMR strategy is expensive. First, some seats on the aircraft that could generate profits by transporting passengers are occupied by maintenance staff if they move along with the aircraft. Second, travel and accommodation allowances should be paid to the maintenance staff. Third, the maintenance personnel schedules of the airline are disrupted. Thus, airlines have to balance between the additional expenditures generated by adopting the SMR strategy and the costs of cancelling flights. Moreover, when conducting recovery, airlines usually endeavor to keep the original flight schedule and aircraft routing unchanged. That is, a re-scheduling/routing plan is preferred if it induces the minimum impact on the original plan. This leaves great challenges for airlines to adjust the tactical plan to meet the urgent needs arising in operations.====Although the AMRP has been extensively studied, relatively less attention has been paid to the operational aircraft re-routing problem. This study aims to propose a new aircraft re-routing approach to fulfil the maintenance requirements arising in the operational stage by both capacity-constrained maintenance stations and the SMR strategy. Flights could be cancelled with a high penalty, while the impact on the original plan is minimized. To achieve this, specialized flight networks are constructed for high-time aircraft to guarantee maintenance opportunities, and a column generation-based algorithm is developed to obtain high-quality solutions within short computational times. Note that some existing AMRP studies have considered the usage of deadhead flights to reposition an aircraft to a different station where it is needed to cover a flight leg or where it can take maintenance checks, which is totally different from the SMR strategy proposed in this study. The flight network construction logic (e.g., flight connection arcs, maintenance arcs) is also different for these two strategies.====As we investigate an operational AMRP in this study, the planning horizon is set as one day. That is, given a list of high-time aircraft, a list of non-high-time aircraft, and initial airports, the goal of the recovery problem is to re-route the aircraft to cover the scheduled flights (note that flights are allowed to be cancelled with high penalties), while ensuring that all the high-time aircraft can conduct maintenance checks at the end of the day. Thus, both flights and aircraft need to be re-planned. The maintenance check could be conducted by either a resource-feasible maintenance station or the maintenance resources sent to the airport by the airline. As pointed out by Sarac et al. (2006), the time horizon of the aircraft recovery problem could be even shorter, like several hours, as disruptions usually occur during the middle of a day, while a longer horizon, like a week, is more like a tactical planning problem that is too optimistic for the disruptions frequently occurring in daily operations.====This paper is organized as follows. First of all, the previous related literature is reviewed from three perspectives in Section 2. Then, Section 3 builds the mathematical model for the operational flight scheduling and aircraft routing problem. Then, a column generation-based solution algorithm is developed in Section 4, while computational experiments are demonstrated in Section 5.

Although there are studies concerned with estimating this potential benefit, isolating the impacts of ATM inefficiencies on a certain air network is yet a complex task that relies on privately-owned data on aircraft performances and operational parameters, and assumptions regarding ideal and feasible flight paths, which may hamper proper monitoring by all stakeholders involved. To tackle those limitations, we propose a statistical approach based on public data of actual flights. Using ==== techniques, we estimated extra fuel burn rates due to path stretch and level segments inside origin and destination terminal areas. We applied the proposed methodology to the 20 most flown routes of the Brazilian domestic market in two different periods, covering 44 days in 2017 and 60 days in 2019. The results indicate that the model is capable of isolating the impacts of path stretch and level segments inside origin and destination terminal areas on the fuel consumption of the air network analyzed. Considering the 2019 sample as a reference, our estimates indicate that if all flights analyzed could fly great circle paths with continuous climbs and descents with the same operational parameters as those flights that could do so, the average potential savings would be between 189-231 L, mainly driven by horizontal inefficiency of descents. For vertical inefficiencies in terminal airspace, results indicate average potential savings per flight of about 4 L with continuous climbs and 20 L with continuous descents, if trajectories could reach the sample best performers, and considering the upper limit of the estimates. This study may help air navigation service providers, aviation authorities, airlines, and airports in monitoring ATM inefficiencies to prioritize operational improvement efforts, air traffic flow management (ATFM) measures, and technology investments.","Fuel-efficient flights are of great interest to the entire civil aviation industry and have been the subject of research for decades, encouraged by both economic and environmental factors. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA, 2020), in 2019 aviation kerosene accounted for 23.5% of airlines’ operating costs. In Brazil, this number was even higher, 30%, according to the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC, 2020). Many studies have shown over the past years that improvements in air traffic management play an important role in reducing aviation fuel consumption. In the IPCC report (IPCC, 1999), for example, researchers estimated that improvements in ATM could reduce 6–12% of aviation emissions, and they were anticipated to happen in the next 20 years. Despite several advances, recent studies indicate that further efficiency gains in ATM, that could reduce fuel consumption, may be achievable if the negative impacts of airspace constraints and bad meteorological conditions could be diminished, especially in arrival terminal areas (Murça et al., 2020).====At a global level, ATM modernization initiatives have been guided by ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP) (ICAO, 2019a), which structures the implementation of new technologies through the Aviation System Block Upgrades (ASBU). Among many elements of the ASBUs, Performance Based Navigation (PBN) procedures, continuous descent (CDO) and climb (CCO) operations, Trajectory Based Operations (TBO), and better meteorological forecasts are expected to deliver significant fuel savings. Thus, faced with opportunities for improvement, states need to identify the most inefficient areas to prioritize investments and then assess the impact of changes.====A set of studies analyzed the potential of new procedures before implementations. In this stream of literature, the fuel consumption of actual flight paths and reference or ideal ones are estimated using a database of aircraft performances (e.g. BADA) and then compared. Melby and Mayer (2008), for example, analyzed trajectory data of one day of operations at 34 airports in the United States to quantify the potential benefits of Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) procedures along with CDOs and CCOs. Their results indicate that operators could save up to 160 million US dollars in fuel consumption annually with more efficient descent and climb profiles. Also for the US market, Robinson III and Kamgarpour (2010) estimated the benefits of CDOs in uncongested and congested airspace, and their results suggested potential savings of about 3% of fuel, especially in moderate demand scenarios. Knorr et al. (2011) analyzed the potential of CDOs and cruise speed reductions to absorb delays since much of the extra fuel consumed is related to aircraft sequencing problems at the terminal area. Their results suggested that the potential for improvement in the terminals averaged 3 min or 100 kg of fuel per flight. In Brazil, Pamplona et al. (2015) analyzed the fuel consumption benefits of using PBN procedures and CDOs on the Galeão-Guarulhos route compared to conventional procedures. With PBN procedures, possible gains were up to 7% of the total fuel consumed on the flight while continuous descents could reduce up to 30% of descent fuel.====Another set of studies used similar techniques for post-operational analyses. Howell and Dean (2017), for instance, assessed the impact of FAA initiatives on flight efficiency during the descent phase. Their results indicated that there have been significant reductions in fuel consumption due to the new procedures, especially in places where optimized descent profiles and time-based traffic control measures have been adopted. Focused on developing new performance indicators for ATM assessment, Leones et al. (2018) analyzed air traffic data from the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) area and proposed new performance indicators based on different reference trajectories that consider the cost efficiency for airspace users. Extending the methodology of the previous study, Prats et al. (2019) focused on the environmental inefficiencies and proposed nine fuel-based performance indicators to isolate the impacts of inefficiencies in different ATM layers, i.e., strategic, and tactical inefficiencies on the horizontal and vertical/speed profiles. Kuljanin et al. (2021) extended the previous study (performed for the FABEC - Functional Airspace Block Europe Central level) by applying a set of filters for different levels of data aggregation at ECAC level. Rosenow et al. (2022) investigated vertical flight efficiency in terms of fuel consumption in Europe and China.====Despite providing reliable and useful estimates on fuel savings from changes in ATM procedures, the methodologies of the studies cited rely on private data on aircraft performances and operational parameters from airlines (or estimations of these parameters), which may hinder the proper assessment and monitoring by all stakeholders involved, such as airports, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), and public entities concerned with city air quality. Besides that, small changes in the inputs of the aircraft performance models may have a substantial impact on the predicted fuel savings, as reported by Robinson III and Kamgarpour (2010) and Pagoni and Psaraki-Kalouptsidi (2017).====In a different approach, Ryerson et al. (2014) use econometric techniques to analyze the actual fuel consumption of flights, considering the impacts of terminal inefficiencies and delays. Instead of comparing actual flights with ideal trajectories, they statistically identify the most efficient terminals and estimate the savings if all terminals could achieve the performance of the most efficient one, which allows estimating the impacts of ATM without trajectory data. In that study, the authors do not distinguish between inefficiencies in the vertical or horizontal flight profiles.====The recent advent of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and online platforms providing ADS-B data (e.g. FlightAware, Opensky, and Flightradar24) allow analyzing the ATM service performance in terms of fuel consumption regardless of private ANSP or airline data availability. ADS-B is a technology for air traffic surveillance developed and certified as a viable low-cost replacement for conventional radar. It uses a combination of satellites, transmitters, and receivers to provide flight crews and ground control personnel with information about the location and speed of aircraft, in addition to other pre-selected flight data. Equipped aircraft broadcast their data automatically to any airplane or ground station with an ADS-B receiver (ICAO, 2014; Richards et al., 2010).====Thus, in a similar approach to Ryerson et al. (2014), we extend the literature by presenting a linear regression model of fuel consumption, based on actual flight-level data reported by airlines, that allows isolating the impacts of level-offs in terminal areas and path stretches.

Flights subject to regulations are delayed on the ground by the computer assisted slot allocation system, which uses a first-planned, first-served principle to allocate the delays. In the last decades, many researchers have proposed alternative models based on more or less complex optimisation techniques, which could effectively resolve overloads with less delay. Despite the fact that these models were very promising, changing the current operational system and procedures - which trust is supported by a successful working history dating back to 1995–may not be realistic in the short term. This paper examines the gradual transition from current air traffic flow management to a futuristic model in which flights are assigned delays with massive cherry-picking measures that minimise the total delay in the network, without necessarily adhering to the first-planned, first-served rule. A reference model with greedy regulations representative of current operations is compared to a model where the Network Manager optimises regulations using hyper-heuristics, a model based on massive cherry-picking measures, and hybrid models that consider regulations to resolve major overloads and cherry-picking measures only for residual overloads. These models are compared in critical scenarios with major capacity issues caused by adverse weather conditions. Results suggest that hybrid models could be a viable option for reducing delays with minor changes in the current air traffic flow management paradigm.","Adapting capacity to demand is the first step in aligning demand and capacity. This can be accomplished by modifying the airspace configuration, for example. If demand still cannot be met, air traffic flow management (ATFM) measures are implemented to match demand with available capacity. At present, the most common measure in Europe consists of limiting the rate at which aircraft enter congested traffic volumes==== during a given period of time, i.e., to activate regulations. The flights subject to one or several regulations are issued with a ground delay on a first-planned, first-served basis by the Computer Assisted Slot Allocation (CASA) system (Network Manager, 2018) so that the maximum entry rates in the corresponding traffic volumes are not exceeded during the regulated periods. It is worth noting that CASA is a heuristic algorithm, not an optimisation procedure, that airspace users recognise as equitable because it applies the same rules to all flights. The reader is referred to Vranas (1996) and the references therein for further details about the rules used by CASA to assign and manage delays.====The different flow managers across Europe, in collaboration with the Network Manager, are those who decide when and where to apply regulations to resolve overloads in their area of responsibility. Because of the complex interactions between the active regulations in the network, this implies that the global (i.e., network-wide) delay is primarily governed by the judgements of different humans to resolve their own, local, problems. Even though humans can handle simple scenarios with moderate overloads efficiently, their performance is expected to deteriorate in critical scenarios (e.g., when severe convective weather causes a substantial drop of capacity over a vast region). In this context, countless scientists have been interested for many decades in designing models for optimising ATFM measures at the network level.====In parallel to the deployment of CASA, Vranas (1996) and Bertsimas and Patterson (1998) proposed the presumably first models of the so-called slot allocation problem, which could be solved by using standard mixed-integer programming (MIP) optimisation solvers. Results revealed that the solution of these models could significantly reduce the total delay, when compared to the use of regulations and CASA in the same conditions. The main challenge at that time was the execution time of the optimisation solvers.====Remarkable advances in optimisation solvers have enabled real-time computation of network-wide optimal slot allocations, and a new wave of models has emerged in the recent years. For instance, Ivanov et al. (2017) proposed a model that minimises delay propagation to subsequent flights, simultaneously increasing flight adherence to departure slots at coordinated airports. Bolić et al. (2017) also proposed a model that can be solved in short computation times for large-scale instances. A variant that also considers aircraft rotations through the turn-around time constraints was proposed by Pellegrini et al. (2017). Recently, Bolić et al. (2021a) introduced a model that also quantifies the flexibility (by means of time windows) of each flight, and a convenient way of presenting the solutions of this model to the flow managers was proposed in a complementary publication (Bolić et al., 2021b). Finally, Xu et al. (2020) proposed a collaborative ATFM framework aiming to improve the cost-efficiency for airspace users, which also considers alternative trajectories with re-routing and/or level capping in addition to delay.====The current ATFM paradigm, however, is far from a model that assigns specific delays to individual flights with a logic rather opaque to the airspace user. Even though the aforementioned research studies demonstrated through realistic use cases that the total delay could be reduced by adopting optimisation models, the current slot allocation by the CASA algorithm is regarded as equitable by airspace users, and is a legacy and trusted method that has proven to ensure safe flight operations since 1995.====The main contribution of this paper is to examine the transition from the current ATFM paradigm based on regulations (not necessarily optimal) and CASA, to a futuristic model in which flights are assigned individual delays by solving a global slot allocation problem. In particular, a baseline model representative of current operations in which regulations are put in place greedily to resolve local overloads is compared with (1) a model in which regulations are optimised by using the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) algorithm (2) a model in which massive cherry-picking measures are issued as a result of solving the slot allocation problem and (3) two hybrid variants that resolve major overloads with optimal regulations and only use cherry-picking measures to deal with the residual overloads. The comparison is carried out for several critical scenarios during the summer of 2019 with major capacity issues due to convective weather over France and Spain.====The various ATFM models examined in this paper were designed in the scope of the ISOBAR project (Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Meteo-Based DCB Imbalances for Network Operations Planning), and the critical scenarios are those selected for the human-in-the-loop validation exercises with the French and Spanish flow managers of the area control centres involved in the project. ISOBAR is an exploratory research project funded by the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking that aims at integrating enhanced convective weather forecasts for predicting capacity reductions (Jardines et al., 2021), and ATFM models build on artificial intelligence to select mitigation measures at local and network level in a collaborative way. The paper will briefly mention the machine learning models that improve convective weather forecasts and predict capacity reductions, but they are beyond the scope of this paper. This paper only covers the ATFM models of the ISOBAR's network operations planning service.====The document is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the basic model of the slot allocation problem, as well as the working principles of the ALNS algorithm. Then, Section 3 describes the various ATFM models compared in the experiment.

Using data from international airline markets, we observe price reductions by connecting incumbents in response to high-quality (nonstop) entry. We also find evidence of product repositioning (increases in total itinerary distance) by connecting incumbents. However, we do not observe significant policy changes by incumbents offering nonstop flights. Additional evidence suggests that the reason for the response by connecting incumbents is the opportunity cost of connecting at desirable airports such as airline hubs.","Entry has long been considered by economists as an important source of efficiency increases. This has been expressed in policies such as free trade agreements or the ====, which specify that the potential for entry should be taken into account during merger review. However, most analyses of entry are limited to changes in the overall price level. In this paper, we add to our understanding of the competitive effects of entry. In particular, we provide empirical evidence for price and product positioning adjustments in response to entry in markets with quality differentiation. In addition, we show that in the markets studied here these effects exist only or at least are stronger for products relatively dissimilar to the entering one.====The context of our study is international air traffic, where we explore incumbent airlines’ responses to the entry of nonstop flights. We show that connecting incumbents decrease prices and increase total itinerary distance when facing a nonstop entrant. However, we do not observe significant price reductions for incumbents offering nonstop flights. Given the increase in competition, the price response is expected, though it is surprising that fares for nonstop flights, which should be affected more by nonstop entry, show no significant reaction. In addition, the repositioning of connecting flights is somewhat counterintuitive as an increased itinerary distance and hence flight time may make the flight less desirable for travelers.====We discuss possible explanations for this effect and present additional evidence suggesting that connecting flights get re-routed because the reduced revenue after entry no longer justifies the opportunity cost of using the more desirable connecting airport: we find that after entry, significantly fewer flights connect at hub airports than before. Given the substantial hub premium found by prior literature (Borenstein, 1989, Ciliberto and Williams, 2010), it is reasonable to assume that airlines incur significant opportunity costs when connecting at their hubs. In addition, when separating our sample by the type of connecting airport, we do not find significant effects for flights connecting outside of hubs. An alternative explanation for our findings would be that connecting incumbents avoid hubs in an effort of increasing vertical differentiation and thus reducing competition in the market. However, when focusing on markets where connecting incumbent and nonstop entrant are identical, we find no significant rerouting, suggesting that product differentiation is not the main driver of our findings. We conclude that airlines reroute flights to open capacities at hubs for other connections that have now become relatively more valuable.====Within the large literature on entry, many studies have considered the incumbents’ choice between entry deterrence and accommodation. Limit pricing models emphasize entry deterrence by reducing prices preemptively and thus rendering entry unprofitable (Bain, 1956, Modigliani, 1958, Sylos-Labini, 1962). The early empirical literature has found little support for the limit pricing theory (see, e.g., Smiley, 1988 and Singh et al., 1997). However, some recent articles find behavior consistent with limit pricing. Bagchi and Sivadasan (2017) find that prices in cable television markets drop significantly in response to regulation reforms lowering the barriers to entry, even in markets where entry did not occur. Sweeting et al. (2020) develop a dynamic limit pricing model and find that incumbent airlines behave consistently with their model when entry by Southwest is threatened.====More recently, researchers have also considered the idea of entry deterrence through non-price measures. Krouse (1991) provides an overview of early theoretical models. Dafny (2005) and Ellison and Ellison (2011) show that incumbents’ investments are non-monotonic in market size and argue that this indicates an entry deterrence motive. Cookson (2018) presents evidence that casinos threatened with entry invest in physical capacity, and that these investments can succeed in deterring entry.====Other studies argue that an incumbent’s response to entry is selective (Yamawaki, 2002) and that the aggressiveness of the response depends on the characteristics of the incumbent, the new entrant, and the market (Simon, 2005, Mccann and Vroom, 2010). Yamawaki (2002) finds that some car manufacturers cut prices in response to entry while others do not. Gielens et al. (2008) also find heterogeneous responses from incumbents when facing Wal-Mart’s entry in the U.K. In an attempt to reconcile the previous findings and to explain the variation among the responses by incumbents, Simon (2005) suggests a more general explanation: the response’s aggressiveness depends on an incumbent’s incentives, proposing that incumbents implement deeper price cuts if they are younger, active in multiple markets, active in concentrated markets, or benefit from high entry barriers.====While a lot of attention has been paid to price responses to entry, some studies have also investigated nonprice responses. Shaked and Sutton (1982) assume a simultaneous entry model in which incumbents engage in product differentiation. Donnenfeld and Weber (1992) extend the simultaneous entry model and use a sequential entry game to show that dominant firms will maximally differentiate their product from the incumbent’s. Bergemann (2002) argues that the optimal deterrence strategy depends on the current position of the new product in the quality spectrum. Matsa (2011) considers incumbent retailers’ responses to Walmart entry. He finds that incumbents increase their quality in response to entry. Bauner and Wang (2019) also focus on the retail sector and study responses to Costco warehouse openings. Their results suggest that incumbents employ a strategy of horizontal differentiation.====In the context of air traffic, Goolsbee and Syverson (2008) find that in the airline industry major carriers cut their prices in response to the mere threat of entry (as opposed to actual entry) by Southwest Airlines, consistent with entry deterrence. Prince and Simon (2015) find that incumbent’s on-time performance worsens in response to entry or threat of entry, either because of cost-cutting measures or because of a strategy of accommodation. Bet (2021) shows that incumbents can deter entry by adjusting departure times. By running separate regressions on routes with high and low entry risk, we can rule out that the observed effects are primarily reactions to entry threat. Instead, our results are driven by actual entry. We also observe a significant difference in the reactions of nonstop and connecting incumbents. There is no significant evidence for price reductions by nonstop incumbents either before or after entry, consistent with entry accommodation. However, connecting incumbents react both by reducing prices and through a previously little-explored avenue: re-routing of flights. These results are somewhat reminiscent of those by Oum et al. (1995) and Berechman et al. (1998) who both find that incumbents may adjust their network structure in response to entry or the threat of entry. Our results are also related to those of Li et al. (2022) who find that some incumbent airlines reposition from connecting to direct flights once a low-cost carrier enters the market. However, our case differs from theirs because the observed repositioning does imply a higher level of quality offered by incumbents.====Most of the literature on airline entry focuses on the reactions of incumbents when low-cost carriers (LCCs) enter the market. This literature has generally found that incumbent airlines reduce their price following the entry of an LCC (Joskow et al., 1994, Goolsbee and Syverson, 2008, Gayle and Wu, 2013, Huse and Oliveira, 2012). But Geroski (1995) points out that incumbents respond selectively to different new entrants. Thus, studying incumbents’ responses to nonstop flight entry provides insights into the extent to which the conclusions of the studies on LCC entry can be generalized to high-quality product entry.====Compared to domestic airline markets, low-cost carrier (LCC) entry and mergers are substantially less frequent in international aviation. International routes are usually long-haul flights for which LCCs efficiency advantages over legacy carriers are less pronounced; therefore, entries of LCCs are significantly less common in international markets than in domestic markets and entrants are more comparable. Additionally, international routes experience fewer mergers than domestic ones. Hence, by focusing on international markets we face fewer confounding factors than we would otherwise, simplifying identification of causality.====Our findings show that the products most similar to the entrant do not necessarily show the strongest reaction to entry. In our context this seems to be caused by capacity constraints of airline hubs. Given that capacity constraints are binding in numerous industries, this finding is likely to generalize to other sectors of the economy.====The remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present an overview of our data. Section 3 discusses the main empirical analysis and robustness checks. In Section 4, we discuss the reasons for our empirical findings and present additional evidence supporting our conclusions.

However, to the best of our knowledge, few academic papers have directly explored the recovery patterns of airlines after the pandemic. Meanwhile, related studies all focused on full-service carriers (FSCs) except ==== studied the integrators FedEx, UPS, and DHL and ==== investigated cargo carriers. There has little detailed analysis been done to date on the COVID-19 effect on low-cost carriers (LCCs).====Researchers have different opinions on the recovery of LCCs. For example, ==== argued that the outbreak of COVID-19 brings LCCs chances to entry hub airports, enabling them to compete with existing network carriers to get quick recovery. In contrast, ==== predicated that LCCs would be the underdog in the recovering processes because most government capital was poured into the national carriers. Empirical evidence supporting by accurate data is therefore needed to make sound argument on the LCCs’ network change patterns during the pandemic.====To fulfil these research gaps, this paper aims to explore the performance of China's LCCs after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the first market hit hard by coronavirus, China has entered a domestic air transportation recovery period since April 2020. It is estimated that Chinese domestic aviation market recovered to about 80% of the pre-crisis level by July 2020, and the number of domestic air passengers reached 90% year-on-year (yoy) in April 2021 (====). China has also emerged as a country that welcomed LCCs to some extent (====) but various regulations and barriers of route entry make Chinese LCC sector remains underdeveloped (e.g., ====; ====). Thus, a focus of Chinese domestic sector could help relevant operators and LCCs in other similar countries to develop long-term route network planning in post pandemic business environment, as well as contribute to the studies related to the effect of aviation deregulation on Chinese aviation market.====Air route network is particularly susceptible to disruption events, such as natural disasters, strike action, terrorist threats, or extremely bad weather (====; ====; ====). ==== investigated the early effect of COVID-19 on the global logistics networks and revealed that the integrators (FedEx, UPS, and DHL) have escaped the early months of the pandemic due to the resilience of their point-to-point networks. Inspired by the study of ====, this paper assesses and compares the resilience of LCCs before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.====Overall, this study has two main purposes. (1) To measure those changes in network connectivity and performance of Chinese LCCs since the recovery period. (2) To emphasize the resilience of LCCs against the uncertain crisis. Following ====, this paper takes Spring Airlines (9C), West Air (PN)，China United Airlines (KN)，Jiuyuan Airlines (AQ), and Lucky Air (8L) as Chinese LCCs.

According to the types of financing used and the results of the investments, several countries have established particular subsidy strategies aiming to integrate their regions through air services. On the other hand, a few studies have explained the physical attributes of the served areas, demonstrating their reliance on air transport as it is the only feasible means of transportation. This article aims to distinguish the geographical characteristics of these areas, revealing the circumstances that explain the necessity of subsidies for air transport operation. The socio-economic information was collected from 1365 subsidized routes in 28 countries in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The profiles of the served communities were divided into nine clusters. The results reveal that 51.36% of the subsided flights connect as lifelines to isolated populations in either remote or inaccessible regions mainly to satisfy social and humanitarian services. Many of these areas depend on air transport because they are sparsely occupied or home to an underprivileged population. However, this service may be commercially unfeasible. This situation legitimizes air service subsidization as a crucial requirement to guarantee the population's access to places where they may meet essential needs.","It is widely known that air travel promotes economic growth and development by making easier the integration of the domestic and international levels (Fageda et al., 2018). The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 granted payments for domestic and international regular air services in the United States. Subsidies were justified by the need to support not only a newly established industry but also the national defense. Despite growing concerns about such payments, subsidies increased in the following decades. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 tried to stop airline subsidization from happening in the United States since 1919. In Europe, until the 1980s, flag carriers had also been receiving government subsidies. The European Commission attempted to redefine subsidies due to concerns about the levels of permissible state aid and overcapacity in the airline industry for the first time (Gössling et al., 2017).====As previously stated, the government policies aimed at subsidizing air travel implemented in stages throughout the twentieth century, each with a unique set of characteristics and focusing on specific agents. The subsidies supported the renovation, construction, and expansion of airports, as well as the operation of state-owned airlines (García, 1983; Fengjun et al., 2004; Masayoshi and Trevor, 2012; Ryerson and Woodburn, 2014; Turolla et al., 2011).====After decades of subsidies, the more the number of passengers and routes increased, the more the regulation became ineffective because some airlines developed monopolistic practices, inflating airfares and creating barriers for new airlines to go into business. This government intervention and support was exhausted in the last decades of the 20th century. In this context, greater liberalization of the air market emerged in a more competitive environment. Consequently, airlines were freer to fight for travelers in the market, being allowed to select the route they operated and also set their fares. Since the United States' 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, this tendency has spread worldwide, encouraging the emergence of low-cost airlines (Wittman et al., 2016; OCDE/ITF, 2018), which resulted in the growth of the air travel markets (Hooper, 1998; Wang et al., 2016).====However, many profit-driven airlines neglected routes operating in remote regions with low passenger demand because they were considered unprofitable after liberalization. It caused a lack of air connectivity to and from remote areas after airline declined these routes (Kinene, 2021). According to Bråthen and Halpern (2012) and Fageda et al. (2018), air transport services to remote regions are a community's social right. Additionally, they make it possible to manage human and natural resources more efficiently, and influence resource allocation, value-added, and income. Nevertheless, these services are difficult and costly to provide. In this context, air transport provision to isolated regions often requires third-party involvement to make it practical. Central or regional authorities frequently fund subsidies as a public policy that may play a critical role in promoting flights in remote areas (Fageda et al., 2018).====Some countries reacted to this trend because governments are interested in air connectivity as it may provide significant economic benefits to the population and to the broader economy (OCDE/ITF, 2018). As a result, subsidy schemes were implemented as an attempt to assure access to and from minor communities or places with insufficient demand for commercial air services (Kinene et al., 2020). Many governments have made distinctions on their subsidy scheme based on jurisdictions, types of instruments, and subsidy justification. Some examples of air subsidy programs for remote areas are the Public Service Obligations (PSO) in the EU, Essential Air Service Program in the US, and the Australian Remote Air Service Subsidy (RASS) (Gössling et al., 2017). Moreover, governments have adopted different criteria to select communities for subsidy schemes, such as remote areas, minor communities, isolated communities, and non-commercially feasible routes (Fageda et al., 2018; Bråthen et al., 2012).====Despite the intentions, there is some evidence that the subsidy level for making air transport achievable due to lack of bids can be questioned as it may have been higher than necessary (Williams and Pagliari, 2004; Santana, 2009). Additionally, there is some criticism regarding the misuse of subsidized schemes for selecting routes that do not meet the criteria for subsidized routes leading to high levels of redundant routes (Fageda et al., 2018). To Williams (2005) the subsidies scheme needs to be amended to prevent misuse, reduce its level and encourage innovation.====Thus, countries with large aviation markets worldwide, such as the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Japan, have still been using subsidy policies to guarantee connectivity from isolated regions to airports provided by regular airline networks. When Grubesic and Wei (2012) analyzed the Essential Air Service (EAS), they observed significant subsidy variations and marked differences in passengers served, raising serious concerns regarding the program's overall efficiency. Thus, they recommended subsidy reductions and changes to the eligibility guidelines to improve performance. Bråthen and Halpern (2012) investigated the schemes used in the subsidy program of the European Union and the United States. The study has led to the conclusion that the level of fares and the competitive tendering process should be designed to make the regional air transport network act as a feasible support factor for regional economic development. Bråthen and Eriksen (2018) discovered an approach to predict the social eﬃciency of subsidized routes in Norway, among the most benefited European countries, and got to the conclusion that loosening the level of service (LOS) restrictions on this category of regional air transport may result in higher ticket prices with lower quality.====Other regions distinguished by their geographical nearness to the planet's poles are also represented in air transport subsidy programs, such as Canada, where arctic communities have an inadequate or nonexistent ground connection, and Chile, which has isolated communities in the Province of Magallanes. Air services to these remote locations are shaped by diverse requirements and approaches, but always aiming to integrate populations with their corresponding air transportation systems.====Finally, as stated by Fageda et al. (2018), the potential positive effects of these incentives should be weighed against their costs. The subsidies may be beyond the needs as some benefited routes are non-isolated and dispose of other transportation means. However, extreme remote communities exclusively depend on air travel to meet their basic needs. Such air services are primarily lifelines for humanitarian and social assistance.====Even though there has been an increase in the interest in the impact of the incentives on regional air transport, most studies focus on airfares and regional economic development benefits rather than the social role of subsidies in minor communities. Such social roles allow mobility for healthcare and education, improving people's standard of living and social inclusion (Wu et al., 2020).====Consequently, a gap was observed in the literature on how and under what circumstances subsidized regional routes in remote and economically unsustainable locations can be provided. Based on it, the following question arose: “What are the geographic and socioeconomic characteristics of lifelines routes that unquestionably confirm the necessity for air travel subsidies?====This article investigates how the existing incentive programs from a worldwide perspective can reveal patterns that explain the choice for the benefited areas and associate them with their geographical characteristics. Thus, this work aims to identify the essential attributes of the routes and understand how they might explain the necessity for subsidized air services.====This work can contribute to the discussion by observing the perspectives of the programs in justifying the State's intervention to correct market failures by a selective allocation of subsidies. Thus, this article contributes to understanding the motivations of several programs in reaching isolated populations, whether for social service, national defense, or economic issues.====This article aims to discover the geographical characteristics of communities in countries of multiple continents, dimensions, and populations that have become highly reliant on subsidized air services as lifeline connections by gathering articles and data from 28 countries worldwide, as well as those published on government websites.",The geographical characteristics of subsidized air routes serving as lifelines,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000990,11 August 2022,2022,Research Article,94.0

A conventional PMS includes two arc-shaped route segments referred to as sequencing legs and a single merge point to merge arrivals. When necessary, arrivals can be delayed along these legs using path stretching before they are directed to the merge point. After merging, aircraft join the final approach. The parallel-point merge system (P-PMS), however, has a more complex route structure which consists of two oppositely located PMS and a set of common points located between the merge points and final paths of runways. This system increases the capacity of the airspace and provides the advantages of the single PMS. However, especially in simulation studies where P-PMS has been tested, the emphasis on wind sensitivity came to the fore as one of the main issues affecting the use of the system. The use of P-PMS was stated as feasible but more difficult due to the loss of symmetry, especially when the wind is perpendicular to the sequencing legs. Controllers may need help in providing safe and efficient sequences in this type of structure. In this study, a multi-objective two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for P-PMS to obtain robust aircraft sequences, schedules, and runway assignments considering the uncertainties of both wind direction and speed. The model was implemented on the existing layout of Istanbul Airport having a P-PMS serving five parallel runways using the real traffic and wind data. A scenario-based approach was adopted to represent the uncertainties of the model. Also, to meet the demands of the various stakeholders in the air traffic system, the minimization of total fuel consumption, total flight time, and total delays were considered as single and multi-objectives. As a result, it was found that the stochastic approach provides better solutions in terms of objective values and emission outputs compared to deterministic and FCFS approaches under wind uncertainties. The differences between these solutions are quantified through numerical experiments.","The increase in demand has led to overcapacity and delays in the air traffic management (ATM) system and this situation has led researchers to seek operational improvements (Eltoukhy et al., 2017). Delays experienced in the en-route phase can be mitigated using reduced vertical separation methods (Ng et al., 2020). However, the bottlenecks have shifted to the Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) in recent years (Liang, 2018). Various ATM development programs, (i.e. SESAR in Europe (SESAR, 2020), NextGen in the U.S (NextGen, 2020), and CARATS in Japan (CARATS, 2020)) have been developed to reduce the workload of air traffic controllers (ATCos) and to help them provide optimal aircraft sequences within TMAs. One of the main focuses of these programs is the Arrival Manager (AMAN) system (Toratani, 2019) which calculates the optimum sequences for arriving aircraft within the TMAs. However, it has been observed that controllers revert to traditional vector techniques, especially during peak hours (Liang et al., 2016a). These traditional techniques increase the ATCo workload as it requires a lot of radio communication between pilots and ATCos. In addition, these techniques may result in non-continuous descent, since a step-by-step approach is applied with these traditional vectoring techniques (Liang et al., 2016a), (de Wilde, 2018).====The point merge system (PMS), given in Fig. 1, was developed by EUROCONTROL in 2006 to enable controllers to implement systematic sequences and replace the traditional vector technique in TMAs even during peak hours (Boursier et al., 2007). The PMS is based on the principle that the aircraft is taken to the sequencing legs (SLs) and directed to the merge point (MP) with a single instruction after the necessary separation has been provided. Range rings in its structure help ATCOs understand that the required separation has been achieved between successive aircraft (EUROCONTROL, 2020). PMS which was created based on the Area-Navigation (RNAV) route structure, significantly reduces controller workload and provides fuel savings thanks to the route structure that allows continuous descent (Şahin and Usanmaz, 2013).====PMS has attracted considerable attention in the literature in recent years. Various simulation studies are carried out to compare the point merge system with the traditional vector technique (Boursier et al., 2007), (Sahin et al., 2018), (EUROCONTROL, 2020), (Şahin and Usanmaz, 2013), (Favennec et al., 2009). These studies have shown that this technique has many advantages compared to the traditional vector technique, which can be summarized as decreasing the following: the number of instructions given to the pilot, the fuel consumption of aircraft, controller workload, controller-pilot bi-directional frequency occupancy time, risk of misunderstanding in communication, negative environmental effects, flight time, and the distance flown. It also provides predictions in terms of landing sequence, efficient use of runway capacity, and collecting arrival routes into a narrower area. The PMS route structure increases situational awareness thanks to range rings and allows for noise level control to be optimized over densely populated areas by allowing continuous descent approaches. The system increases safety and separation accuracy and initial training for controllers and pilots is simple.====The parallel point merge system (P-PMS), presented in Fig. 2, is the combination of two-point merge systems located opposite to one another at large airports. This system increases the capacity of the airspace and provides the advantages previously mentioned for a single PMS (EUROCONTROL, 2020). However, especially in simulation studies where the P-PMS has been tested, the emphasis on wind sensitivity came to the fore as the one of the main issues affecting the use of the system. The visual assessment of the traffic becomes more difficult for monitoring multiple aircraft flying to the common point from opposite PMSs, especially when the wind is perpendicular to the SLs (Favennec et al., 2009). Because the wind affects their ground speeds asymmetrically. In another study, it was stated that this type of structure is very sensitive to external factors, such as wind. The study also discussed the difficulty of optimizing the sequences in such a structure because of additional separation requirements at the common points as well as at MPs (Favennec et al., 2010). Based on these simulations in studies, it can be emphasized that wind is one of the most critical external factors that needs to be considered for P-PMS optimization, considering that each PMS has two opposite SLs and the aircraft coming from the two PMS each fly through almost 180°. However, when PMS optimization studies are examined, it is noteworthy that there is only one study that includes wind direction uncertainty, and this is only for a single PMS (Cecen et al., 2020), no studies have been found that include this factor for P-PMS.====Air traffic optimization in TMAs includes different types of problems, such as the aircraft landing problem (ALP) (Bennell et al., 2017), (Wu et al., 2016), (Lieder et al., 2015), aircraft departure problem (ADP) (Ali et al., 2008), (Wang et al., 2009), (Atkin et al., 2008), aircraft sequencing and scheduling problem (ASSP) (Ng et al., 2017), (Ghoniem et al., 2014), (Al-Salem et al., 2012). In addition, the runway scheduling problem (RSP) (Guépet et al., 2017), (Ikli et al., 2021), (Lieder and Stolletz, 2016), that includes the assignment of aircraft to the runways as well as arrival and departure sequencing and scheduling. Numerous researches have been presented to systematize arrival-departure operations in TMA's using mixed-integer programming (Guépet et al., 2016), (Cecen and Çetek, 2020), multi-objective programming (Zhang et al., 2020), (Tang et al., 2008), dynamic programming (Bennell et al., 2017), (Lieder et al., 2015), (Ghoniem et al., 2015), metaheuristic algorithms (Hancerliogullari et al., 2013), (Hu and Di Paolo, 2009), (Soykan et al., 2016), (Kaplan and Çetek, 2020), heuristic algorithms (Soomer and Franx, 2008), (Fahle et al., 2003), and stochastic programming (Agustı'n et al., 2012), (Alonso et al., 2000). However, there are a few studies on aircraft scheduling and sequencing in TMA's with PMS using integer linear programming (Hong et al., 2017), mixed integer programming (Lee et al., 2017), multi-objective programming (Liang et al., 2016a), (Liang et al., 2016b), (Tian et al., 2020), (Liang et al., 2016b), (Dönmez et al., 2022), stochastic programming (Cecen et al., 2020), (Hong et al., 2019), (Hong, 2018), (Hong et al., 2018b) and meta-heuristic algorithms (Liang et al., 2015), (Liang, 2015). Table 1 presents a brief description of the PMS related optimization studies in the literature.====To the best of our knowledge, none of the PMS optimization studies considered wind uncertainties except one (Cecen et al., 2020). In (Cecen et al., 2020), only one PMS, one runway, and only the wind direction uncertainty was considered. Furthermore, only delays were considered as an objective function in (Cecen et al., 2020). However, simulation studies, e.g. (Favennec et al., 2009), (Favennec et al., 2010), show that especially the route structure of P-PMS is sensitive to wind.====This study aims to develop a multi-objective two-stage stochastic programming model for the RSP in the airport with P-PMS and parallel runways. Then, we aim to show that the sequencing-scheduling and assignment decisions obtained from this stochastic model provide more fuel, flight time, and delay savings compared to deterministic and FCFS approaches. Also, it is aimed to show that the decisions obtained from deterministic approaches may not be feasible in most cases when the uncertainties occur, stochastic approach, on the other hand, provides robust and optimal solutions for all samples that were solved since it considers uncertainties.====In addition to wind uncertainties, many operational constraints in TMA are considered in the developed stochastic model. Dependent and independent multiple runway operations, as well as arrival-departure mix operations, were modeled in this study. To meet the demands of the various stakeholders in the air traffic system, the objectives of the minimization of total fuel consumption, total flight time, and total delays were handled as single and multi-objectives. The developed model considers many other operational constraints required in real operations in TMA. Therefore, sequencing-scheduling and assignment decisions obtained from this model may constitute a decision support mechanism for the ATCos. In model solutions, in addition to the sequencing-scheduling and assignment decisions, some helpful information such as; which aircraft will be delayed, where and how much they will be delayed, which delay strategy will be used (speed decrease, flight on the sequencing leg, etc.), where the position changes will take place, is provided. All the information allows the controllers to plan the traffic at the tactical phase which covers the tasks on the operation day (Liang, 2018).====The specifications of the developed model can be summarized as follows:",Air traffic management in parallel-point merge systems under wind uncertainties,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000886,8 August 2022,2022,Research Article,95.0

We establish an integrated economic model to derive the equilibrium service frequency, ticket price, traffic and load factor of an inter-city network with expansion through LCCs or HSR. Then, an empirical investigation was supplemented for a real case study in the Chinese market. It is found that although HSR is more emission-efficient per passenger-km, the HSR network expansion can cause more total emissions than the LCC network expansion. This is because LCCs have more flexibility to adjust frequency to maintain high load factors, and their shorter route distance and travel time can reduce total emissions. The HSR network expansion can bring fewer total emissions, only when the expanded small cities are closer to the existing network, and when they have sizable travel demand. This finding calls for caution to evaluate China's strategy to expand its transport network to remote and less-developed regions. In particular, the LCC development needs more favorable support, from the perspective of environmental protection. Our comparative results in terms of emissions and social welfare can also be referred by other major markets around the world to consider using LCCs to expand their inter-city transport networks.","High-speed rail (HSR) is an ideal substitute for air transport on short- and medium-haul routes (Wan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). Many studies have studied the emission impacts of HSR development (Åkerman, 2011; Westin and Kågeson, 2012; Kamga and Yazici, 2014; Yue et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2020b). It has been found that HSR could be more emission efficient by substituting airline services on particular routes.==== This environmental benefit has been one of the major rationales to expand HSR networks around the world. China has already built neary 40,000 km of HSR lines by 2021, forming the “eight vertical and eight horizontal” network. The length of China's HSR network now makes up more than 75% of the world's total length (National Railway Administration of China, 2021). According to China Railway Corporation's recently released “Outline of the Advanced Railway Planning for a Strong Nation in the New Era”, the country is even more ambitious to expand the HSR network to 70,000 km by 2035, covering all cities and counties with a population of 500,000 or more. With most of the populous cities already included in the current HSR network, the new plan mainly targets those small cities in the central and western regions. These newly added markets, however, may not have sufficient intercity traffic demand to guarantee the reasonable load factor of HSR service, and would also change the HSR frequency and load factor of the existing trunk HSR lines.====Low-cost carriers (LCCs) can be used as a close alternative to HSR to expand intercity transport networks to small and remote cities, and are well developed in the US and Europe (Jiang and Li, 2016). LCCs are comparable to HSR in terms of both ticket price and travel time on short- and medium-haul routes (Wang et al., 2017). They are even more flexible in adjusting service frequencies and load factors while not requiring huge infrastructure and maintenance costs. In terms of emissions, although airlines emit more CO==== emissions (referred to as “emissions” hereafter) per passenger-km, LCCs could have higher load factors and aircraft utilization because they use a point-to-point network and fly directly between origins and destinations and have lower fares than full-service airlines (Morrison, 2001). The flight distance of direct flights could be much shorter than the length of the parallel HSR route. Therefore, in terms of total emissions, it is quite unclear whether HSR is indeed more emission friendly than LCC for expanding China's intercity transport network, in particular to those small cities.====In China, the development of the LCC sector lags far behind other developed markets (Zhang et al., 2008; Fu et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2018). LCCs only account for less than 20% of China's airline market, with Spring Airlines as the largest LCC. The penetration rate of LCCs is close to or even exceeds 50% in other major aviation markets, including the US and Europe (CAPA, 2016). LCCs have significant cost advantages over full-service airlines (FSAs). For instance, in China, Spring Airlines' unit operating costs could be 30% lower than the Big Three airlines, namely, Air China, China Eastern and China Southern (Xia et al., 2018). With much lower operating costs, it is economically feasible for LCCs to serve those small and remote destinations where FSAs are reluctant to enter. As a result, LCCs could be an ideal candidate mode for expanding the intercity transport network to the central and western regions of China. However, with such a large-scale HSR expansion in China, the LCC sector has been almost squeezed out on many routes. Spring Airlines has withdrawn from all routes below 800 km due to fierce competition from HSR (Wang et al., 2017). The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has also restricted LCCs' slot acquisitions at major Chinese hub airports to serve small destinations (Hou et al., 2020). LCCs thus face significant hurdles in developing their domestic intercity transport markets.====This paper thus examines and benchmarks the emissions from expanding China's intercity transport network through HSR or LCC, with the empirical investigation conducted under the Chinese market context. It contributes to answering whether the HSR expansion is indeed environmentally friendly and thus leads to fewer emissions; if not necessary, then under what conditions, the LCC network expansion would lead to fewer emissions. First, an analytical model based on a simplified intercity transport network is developed to examine the emissions when expanding the network by HSR and LCC, respectively. Then, an empirical study is conducted in the context of the Chinese market to explore which mode (i.e., HSR vs. LCC) would lead to fewer emissions when expanding the intercity transport network to small and remote cities.====The contributions of this paper are multi-fold. First, it is the first study to benchmark the emissions impact with a large-scale intercity transport network expansion to small-sized cities by alternative transport modes (HSR vs. LCC). Second, the previous literature on transport emissions was mainly focused on per seat or passenger level, or based on exogenously given traffic volumes (e.g., D'Alfonso et al., 2015; Givoni, 2007). This study endogenizes the competition among different transport modes in the transport network to derive the network equilibrium not only on price and traffic but also on service frequency and load factor. Such results could be more accurate to reflect the counterfactual outcomes when the network is expanded with different transport modes. Finally, the empirical analysis shows that the LCC network expansion leads to fewer emissions. Specifically, for those cities that are far from the existing trunk HSR lines or have very low travel demand, developing LCC services can be more environmentally friendly and can even lead to higher social welfare. This finding calls for caution on China's current ambitious HSR expansions mainly to those remote and economically underdeveloped central and western regions.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 specifies the basic economic model and presents the main analytical results on the network expansion by HSR or LCC. In particular, emissions and social welfare are compared. In Section 4, we conduct detailed empirical investigations based on the Chinese market to quantify emissions and social welfare for network expansions by HSR or LCC. We also derive conditions where the LCC network can have lower total emissions and higher social welfare. Section 5 concludes the paper.","Intercity network expansion by low-cost carrier or high-speed rail, from the environmental perspective",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000874,7 August 2022,2022,Research Article,96.0

In many countries, air transport has become an engine for social progress and economic prosperity (Njoya and Nikitas, 2020). It is important to understand the industrial correlation and estimate the economic benefits of air transport when making macro strategic decisions for the air transport industry.====Before the COVID-19 outbreak, China's air transport volume had grown steadily. From 2007 to 2019, China's air passenger turnover increased from 279.17 billion passenger-km to 1170.5 billion passenger-km, an average annual growth rate of 12.7%; air freight turnover increased from 11.64 billion ton-km to 26.32 billion ton-km, an average annual growth rate of 7.0% (Fig. 1). However, the growth trend was interrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020. To control the spread of the epidemic, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) started to take meltdown measures for flights that trigger the flight meltdown conditions from 8 June 2020.==== In 2020, 133 meltdowns were implemented, resulting in a 46.1% drop in China's air passenger turnover and an 8.7% drop in air freight turnover. The volume of air transport fluctuated significantly and its industrial correlation changed. In this context, it is important to consider the changing characteristics of air transport's industrial correlation and estimate its role in the national economy comprehensively.====There are many studies on the impact of air transport on the national economy, most of which adopt the method of added value or an econometric model. Fung et al. (2006) measured the benefits that the aviation industry has brought to the Hong Kong economy using a value-added approach and calculated that the total benefit brought by the aviation industry was 7.02% of GDP in 2003. Marazzo et al. (2010) used a time series analysis to investigate the relationship between air transport demand (passenger-kilometer) and economic growth (GDP) between 1966 and 2006 in Brazil and found that there was a cointegration relationship between them. Chi and Baek (2013) established an autoregressive distributed lag approach to examine the short- and long-run effects of economic growth and market shocks on air passenger and freight services. Button and Yuan (2012) explored the potential role that air freight transport in the United States could play in promoting local and regional economic development based on panel data covering 35 airports and 32 metropolitan areas in the United States from 1990 to 2009. Allroggen and Malina (2014) empirically studied the contribution of air transport to regional economic development in Germany using a regression model and found that output effects of air services and airport infrastructure differ among airports. Florida et al. (2014) used multiple regression analysis to study the role of airports in the regional economy. Baker et al. (2015) studied the relationship between regional air transport and regional economic growth in Australia using the methods of cointegration and causal relationship analysis and proved that there is short- and long-run causality between regional aviation and economic growth. Profillidis and Botzoris (2015) used an econometric model to study the relationship between air passenger traffic and the economy at a global level and for various geographical areas. Küçükönal and Sedefoğlu (2017) applied a panel Granger causality analysis model to study the causal relationship between air transport and socioeconomic factors using data from the World Bank data set for OECD countries between 2000 and 2013. Rashid Khan et al. (2018) used panel data from 40 heterogeneous countries to analyze the impact of air transport, railways transport, and container port traffic on energy demand, customs duties, and economic growth using panel econometric techniques. Hakim and Merkert (2016) used cointegration and causality tests to examine the causal relationship between air transport and economic growth in South Asia, and confirmed the existence of a long-run unidirectional causal relationship from GDP to air passenger traffic as well as air cargo traffic. Hakim and Merkert (2019) examined the determinants of air transport demand in South Asian countries using fixed effects models as well as a three-step error correction mechanism (ECM) approach. They found that per capita income, foreign direct investment (FDI), flight frequency and jet fuel price played a vital role in determining air passenger demand, and income, FDI, industrialization and jet fuel price were significant factors that influence air freight demand. Tolcha et al. (2020) employed a vector error correction model and a vector autoregression model to analyze the relationship between air transport demand and economic development in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa from 1981 to 2018.====In addition, the input–output (I–O) method and the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model can also be used to estimate the contribution of the air transport industry. Numerous reports by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other relevant research institutions used the I–O method to assess the economic impact of air transport. Lee and Yoo (2016) studied the roles of four transport modes (rail, road, water, and air) in the Korean national economy using an I–O analysis. Alejandro Cardenete and López-Cabaco (2018) examined different modes of transport in the economy of Andalusia using an I–O method based on a social accounting matrix (SAM). Chen et al. (2018) analyzed the indirect economic impact of the air transport industry on the local economy of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region using an I–O analysis. Dimitrios and Maria (2018) assessed air transport's footprint in terms of its socioeconomic impact on the national economy using an I–O method and applied the model in Greece to prove that air transport is essential to the national economy. Chen et al. (2017) developed a reduced-form CGE model to evaluate the economic consequences of aviation system disruptions. Njoya and Nikitas (2020) adopted a SAM model to assess the strengths of backward and forward linkages between the air transport sector and the local economy and used a CGE model to estimate the impact of the expansion of the air transport industry in South Africa.====The above studies evaluated the economic effect of air transport from different perspectives, proving that it plays an important role in the national economy. However, there are few quantitative studies about the influence of air transport on other industries from the perspective of industrial correlation, which cannot fully and completely reflect the role of air transport in the national economy. In addition, the role of air transport in the industrial chain changes constantly with the process of economic development. Tracking changes in the economic effect of air transport at different times has theoretical and practical significance for guiding the scientific planning of airport industry clusters and airport economic zones. Therefore, due to the strong applicability and practicability of the I–O method (Yu, 2018; Chen et al., 2018), this paper uses it to study the industrial correlation and economic contribution of China's air transport. The contributions are as follows. (1) Using China's I–O tables in 2002, 2007, 2017, and 2020, the industry linkage effect, the industry ripple effect, the production-inducing effect, and the supply shortage effect of China's air transport are applied and compared over the period 2007–2020. (2) According to the results, the role of air transport in China's economy and its changing characteristics over time are explored, and policy implications are discussed. (3) We comparatively analyse changes in industrial linkages and national economic contributions of China's air transport industry before and after the COVID-19 epidemic to explore and reveal the impact of the epidemic. The results of this study can provide a quantitative basis for the evolution and development of the air transport industry. It can also serve as a reference for the formulation of air transport policies by departments planning and supervising air transport and to improve the level of transport management.====The remaining part of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data sources and methodology employed in this study. This paper studies the influence of air transport from the perspective of industrial correlation, the production-inducing effect, and the supply shortage effect based on I–O models. Section 3 analyzes the results of the models.

The airport resource planning problem is modeled as a process from an aggregate level and an individual level for multiple days' slot scheduling in order to consider capacity uncertainty at airports characterized by meteorological scenarios. The aggregate level uses a two-stage model to minimize the sum of displacement cost and delay cost in the worst-case scenario using Benders’ Decomposition-based algorithm. At the individual level, an integer linear programming model is developed based on the results from the aggregate level to provide specific departure slot and arrival slot for each flight. An airport network composed of 15 coordinated airports in China is studied and shows that by experimental analysis the overall optimization method is capable of providing robust and efficient solutions for slot allocation and benefits from high computational efficiency. The outperformance of the two-stage optimization method from the aggregate level is also illustrated in comparison with the one-stage optimization method. Finally, recommendations for the slot allocation policy in practice are provided.","Affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, global air traffic volume has dropped sharply. However, with the continuous efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO), various aviation departments and countries around the world, global economic development is slowly recovering, and aviation demand is gradually returning to the level before the epidemic. According to the possible evolution of air traffic in Europe, as reported by EUROCONTROL's 2021–2027 forecast, aviation demand will recover to 2019 levels by the end of 2023. And it is expected that the flights will continue to grow over the next coming years, exceeding the pre-epidemic level. Characteristically, the most-likely growth forecast scenario shows 16 million flights in 2050, indicating a 44% increase in total growth compared to the same period in 2019 (EUROCONTROL, 2022). It is clear that even though the impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry, the predicted growth of demand is still expected to experience persistent congestion at airports around the world. Meanwhile, congestion persists and arises on an almost daily basis as a consequence of minor weather disturbances that cause reductions in nominal capacities. The decrease of flight punctuality and poor passenger experience have become increasingly prominent.====In the long term, airport capacity management gradually becomes a critical prerequisite, by improving the operational efficiency of airport resources in order to meet growing demand. Thus, airport slot allocation is considered by researchers and practitioners to be an effective measure for managing demand at coordinated airports. According to the IATA Worldwide Slot Guidelines (WSG), airports are divided into three levels (IATA, 2022). Generally, slot allocation only focuses on Level 3 or coordinated airports where available capacity cannot meet flight demand. Under the IATA WSG, capacity is managed through the slot allocation where slot is a time interval assigned to aircraft for departing from or arriving at a slot-controlled airport. A commonly used criterion for assessing airport scheduling efficiency is the schedule displacement, which is defined as the difference between the originally requested time slots and the allocated slots for all flights. In this context, slot scheduling seeks to assign requests by allocating available capacity provision.====Slots represent scarce resources at coordinated airports. In order to realize demand and capacity balancing, slot allocation is a primary form of air traffic flow management (ATFM) measures for alleviating airport congestion and reducing delay. One of the major challenges in this decision-making process is the existence of uncertain factors, which are not regular and are therefore difficult to predict and can only be revealed on the day of operation. Uncertainty arises mainly from adverse meteorological factors or airspace unavailability due to military requirement restrictions, for example. It is important to consider such uncertainty in mathematical optimization, which involves stochastic programming and robust optimization. Specifically, stochastic programming needs to know the probability distribution of uncertain features, while robust optimization assumes that the distribution is unknown. The initial decisions are made at the strategic stage (defined as the “first stage”), according to some limited information. As time passes, the strategic decision results need to be updated in the tactical stage (defined as the “second stage”). The tactical decisions are taken as a recourse (second-stage) function to revise the results of the first stage. Compared with single-stage robust optimization, two-stage robust optimization considers the dynamic information and reduces the conservative degree of a solution. Another issue relates to the consideration of flight periodicity. Many flights need to complete a flight plan at the same departure airport and at the same slot on different days of operation, and these flights need to be scheduled to the same slot scheme on different days.====In recent years, researchers such as Zografos et al. (2012) and Bichler et al. (2021) have concentrated mainly on the single-stage research, instead of considering both strategic and tactical decisions. In terms of the time dimension, the single-stage decision considers only a limited amount of information, while the two-stage decision can realize the trade-offs between the strategic stage and the tactical stage by considering uncertain information. When making strategic decisions, the information relied on is insufficient and unclear. Relatively speaking, the decision-making information in the tactical stage is more adequate because it is closer to the operational activities. When considering both strategic and tactical decisions, we enable improve the robustness and stability of decision-making outcomes. When focusing on the strategic stage, its decision-making results need to be continuously adjusted to adapt to the changes when applied in the tactical stage, which increases the cost of decision-making and reduces the reliability of decision outcomes. When focusing on the tactical stage, the information in the strategic stage is not fully utilized, making the decision-making results less robust.====In the field of research on two-stage slot allocation considering uncertainty, to the best of our knowledge, Wang and Jacquillat (2020) and Corolli et al. (2014) apply stochastic programming to describe uncertain factors and probability to express uncertainty occurrence. However, Corolli et al. (2014) focus on an aggregate-level operating dynamics instead of flight-level air traffic operations. This resulting scheme does not capture the operational characteristics of each flight and thus cannot be used in practice. The decision-making of aggregate-level dynamics is about the number of flights taking off or arriving within a certain period of time at a coordinated airport. It does not determine the take-off or arrival time slot of each flight. This decision paradigm can reduce computational complexity to some extent, but the decision results cannot be directly applied to actual operations. There is no bias stemming from using aggregate-level analysis. However, this requires further decision-making to derive time-slot information for each flight. A phenomenon that may be hidden when considering aggregate dynamics is the inability to adequately express the correlations between individual flights. What modeled is the number of flights that the airport capacity can accommodate in a certain period of time to ensure the safe operation in the system; therefore, we further model the operation of a single flight to obtain an implementable decision-making scheme.====Wang and Jacquillat (2020) take 15-min as a time slot in the optimization problem. Regarding the constructed model, the decision variables are defined as “by a certain slot”, and the constraints stipulate that flights are only delayed and cannot be advanced. In addition, taking into consideration the network effects and ripple effects of consecutive flights in an airport network is necessary, such as delay propagation and connections between flights. The optimization is to make the slot allocation decision so as to ensure the robustness of decision results. This is expected to achieve the safe and efficient operation of air traffic flow. Wang and Jacquillat (2020) does not consider the effects of periodic flights and delay propagation. The expected benefits of incorporating periodic flights are reflected in two aspects. From the perspective of practical problem, it fully considers the correlation between flights, and the decision-making scheme is more in line with the actual operations. From the perspective of modelling, the number of constraints can be reduced, and the optimization complexity is lower without changing the problem and without affecting the optimal solution. Specifically, for the multiple-day airport slot allocation problem, the number of periodic flights is relatively large, and the slot scheduling for them shows regularity. Without considering the correlation between flights, the computational workload of the optimization algorithm is large. That's how Wang and Jacquillat (2020) handles the problem, but it designs novel accelerated solution techniques, and the proposed algorithm can provide near-optimal solutions in reasonable computational times. Analyses that do not consider delay propagation are inherently problematic. For the slot allocation problem in the airport network, the delay propagation has ripple effects in time and space. Quantifying the propagation effects in the mathematical model and reducing its negative impacts are more effective for decision-making results' robust. Therefore, this paper actually considers the reduction of delay propagation and reduce the extent of ripple effects in the airport network by minimizing delay costs and controlling capacity constraints to some extent. Moreover, the abovementioned researches apply their models separately to a subset of the European network and the full U.S. network, different from the China's airport network considered in this paper.====Based on the above analysis, to further enrich the research on air traffic flow management, this paper constructs a two-step optimization model to study slot allocation problem in an airport network, taking into account the impact of uncertainty on airport capacity. The two-stage model is regarded as the aggregate level, given flight numbers achieved within a certain timeframe, instead of the exact slot for each flight, without having exact information on airport capacity. Then, at the individual level, each aircraft is assigned to the slot schedule after exact information becomes available. In order to achieve more refined management, this paper uses 5-min as a slot and uses the Benders decomposition algorithm to solve the model, supported by the Gurobi solver. Note that we do not consider the impact of airspace on decision-making in this study. The strategic slot allocation problem involves the scheduling of airlines' requests for departures and arrivals at congested (i.e., schedule coordinated) airports before flight operation. The daily scheduling of a coordinated airport is divided into time intervals of a fixed length. An airline's slot request involves the permission to use the airport infrastructure for arrival or departure for a series of days. Given the airlines' requests and the capacity provision of the system, the schedule coordination authority makes a decision and produces a scheme. In this context, the aim of this work is to provide a methodology for planning capacity provision in the presence of uncertainty primarily for airport capacity. Once the latter information is available, we can only resort to demand management measures, namely delaying flights to ensure that all airports operate within their capacity limits. The approach we propose here considers the airport network and guarantees the characteristics of flight connections.====The remainder of this paper is structured into five sections. The current state-of-the-art and our contributions are discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, we propose a two-step optimization model from the aggregate level and the individual level, with a special emphasis on expressing how the two-level scheduling measures are implemented efficiently. Section 4 introduces a resolution algorithm, along with the first-stage and the second-stage details. Results of numerical experiments are discussed and recommendations for the slot allocation policy are provided in Section 5 and Section 6 summarizes our findings and indicates potential research directions for the future.",Research on slot allocation for airport network in the presence of uncertainty,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000898,5 August 2022,2022,Research Article,98.0

Additionally, service quality, which is critical for airports to maintain a competitive edge, is a major area of research in the aviation literature. This study aims to analyze the existing literature on airport service quality through the bibliometric analysis method and to present a perspective on the literature's trajectory. Science mapping techniques and performance analysis were applied in this process. R-based Bibliometrix software was used to investigate 100 studies indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) database between 1975 and 2020. Research findings show that the Journal of Air Transport Management leads the literature in terms of publication performance. Researchers from China offer the highest contribution to the literature as a country. In addition, service quality research has largely resulted from collaboration networks. It is expected that an understanding of the research themes that emerge from the scientific mapping technique will guide researchers.","In the preceding few decades, the civil aviation industry has experienced significant growth. The number of passengers carried worldwide increased from 2.7 billion in 2010 to 4.49 billion in 2019 (ICAO, 2019). Despite the fact that the global COVID-19 pandemic cut passenger traffic by 64.6 percent in 2020 (ACI, 2021), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) (2021) predicts that from 2024 passenger traffic will grow at a rate of 3.2 percent per year until 2039. The growth in the civil aviation industry has led to the opening of new airports as a result of increasing demand. As passenger and cargo traffic has increased over the years, additional airport capacity has become necessary. As of 2017, research from the Center for Aviation (CAPA) has shown that approximately US$255 billion has already been invested in new (greenfield) airport projects worldwide. It also shows that US$845 billion has been invested in the expansion of existing airports, including terminal buildings and runways (CAPA, 2017). While the Asia-Pacific region received the most investment in new airports, with over US$130 billion, Europe received US$70 billion (Graham, 2018). Other statistics indicate that the number of private-use airports in the United States increased by 23.5% between 1990 and 2020 (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2021). Furthermore, as a result of the diversification of aircraft types, the production of heavier and faster aircraft has raised the demand for larger airports. Thus, airports have evolved into key business centers that serve many purposes beyond merely providing transportation infrastructure (Goetz, 2019).====Airports operate in a fiercely competitive environment as a result of the growing number of airport alternatives available to passengers. At this point, it is worth noting that a variety of factors influence an airport's competitive environment. Therefore, some airports face greater competition than others. One of these factors is the airport's unique catchment area. Airport competition is at its lowest when an airport is located on an island or in a remote area (Bakır et al., 2022). There is no or fewer competitive pressure as a single airport serves popular tourist destinations, such as Sharm El-Sheikh and Palma de Mallorca as well as remote locations such as the Greek islands (e.g., Rhodes and Mykonos). The presence of alternative airports in nearby cities affects competition and multiple airport cities, such as Moscow (e.g., Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo) and London (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, City, and Luton), may witness intense competition (Graham and Morrell, 2017).====To avoid losing passengers in a highly competitive environment, airport operators should improve their service standards. For airports, service quality, which measures the gap between passengers’ expectations and perceived service performance, is a key driver of competitive advantage (Atalik, 2009; Halpern and Mwesiumo, 2021). As a result of the changing competitive environment, privatization, and air transport liberalization airports have begun to implement service quality improvement strategies that prioritize passenger expectations. This process is justifiable as a 1% increase in passenger satisfaction leads to a 1.5% increase in non-aeronautical revenues, as stated by Airport Council International (ACI) (ACI, 2016). Understanding the impact of airport service quality on customer satisfaction has prompted airport operators to place a greater emphasis on service quality, and more and more researchers have begun to investigate this topic (Bezerra and Gomes, 2020; Bogicevic et al., 2013; Halpern and Mwesiumo, 2021; Hussain et al., 2015).====The literature on airport service quality has undergone a significant shift. While the literature only had a few studies focusing on the level of service at terminals in the 1980s (Rocha et al., 2022), studies on consumer expectations toward airport service quality began in the 1990s. Furthermore, the literature started to diversify and become enriched after the 2000s (Pandey, 2016). In line with this, Usman et al. (2021) and Rocha et al. (2022) stated that research on airport service quality began to grow in the 2000s. However, despite advances in the literature, airport service quality research is still in its growth stage, despite an increasing number of studies, and we lack an understanding of how the body of knowledge has been constructed to better advance the research area. The extant literature is fragmented and the main research streams have not been explained clearly. Therefore, an in-depth review of the literature is essential in order to understand the structure of the research domain and to identify research themes that have emerged from the past to the present.====To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the studies reviewing airport service quality are quite limited. Zidarova and Zografos (2011) presented a literature review on the methods and units of measurement used to assess service quality in airport terminals. Similarly, Bellizzi et al. (2020b) examined airport and airline service quality literature in terms of the methodology and measurement tools used. Usman et al. (2021) conducted a systematic literature review to outline the evolution of the research on airport service quality dimensions. Most recently, Rocha et al. (2022) undertook a systematic literature review to examine the key aspects of the service quality assessment process at passenger terminals, and Eboli et al. (2022) reviewed the existing literature on air transport service quality from the perspective of passengers, including airline and airport services. Although such descriptive literature reviews allow for retrospective investigations, they involve subjectivity bias and only allow for the analysis of a small number of studies (Tanrıverdi et al., 2020). However, instead of descriptive literature reviews that lack analytical rigor, bibliometric analysis has a strong mathematical foundation, presents quantitatively accurate findings, and reduces subjectivity biases (Gölgeci et al., 2021).====Bibliometric analysis is frequently used in examining the research domain in different disciplines (Ahmad et al., 2021; Cobo et al., 2011; Donthu et al., 2021b; Ertz and Leblanc-Proulx, 2018; Gao et al., 2019; Okumus et al., 2018). Furthermore, various applications have become apparent in the field of civil aviation management. Bergiante et al. (2015) analyzed the evolution of the literature on airline business models between 1990 and 2012 using this approach. Aldemir and Sengur (2017) focused on postgraduate theses and used the same method to explain the research themes on the Turkish civil aviation industry. Tanriverdi et al. (2020) examined the pre-COVID-19 publication evolution of the Journal of Air Transport Management and identified research themes using scientific mapping techniques. Raza et al. (2020) used a bibliometric tool to analyze the literature in the field of airline revenue management from 2008 to 2018. Dixit and Jakhar (2021) studied the evolution of research on airport capacity management over the period 1990–2019 using VOSviewer. Yakath Ali et al. (2021) provided a bibliometric analysis of the research on productivity and efficiency in the airline industry during the 1979–2020 period. Most recently, Merkert (2022) presented a bibliometric analysis revealing the key themes examined when evaluating key performance indicators of the Journal of Air Transport Management. Considering the extant literature, the lack of advanced bibliometric investigation in the airport service quality research is apparent. As such, this study fills this gap by using bibliometric analysis to provide a more objective and in-depth view of the relevant literature.====This study aims to examine the body of literature on airport service quality with the bibliometric analysis approach and describe the course of the literature retrospectively. In this direction, 100 studies indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) database covering the period of 1975–2020 were examined with the R-based Bibliometrix software. First, we used performance analysis to offer a descriptive picture of the existing literature, and we examined research units, such as the top authors, institutions, and countries in terms of productive contribution (Yakath Ali et al., 2021). Furthermore, the most frequently used keywords and research themes were defined through the keywords used by authors in their articles. By doing so, the main themes in airport service quality research and the interaction between them with an integrative view are presented in this study. The dynamics of the scientific field and the relationships between units were then analyzed utilizing science mapping approaches. The existing lack of a bibliometric analysis that comprehensively tackles the path of the existing literature distinguishes this study as unique and important. In addition, we believe that identifying emerging themes will provide researchers in the research domain with a guiding perspective for future studies.",A bibliometric analysis of airport service quality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972200093X,5 August 2022,2022,Research Article,100.0

Consumer resilience positively influences attitude. Attitude positively influences consumer behavioural intention. Finally, behavioural intention positively influences real consumer behaviour.","Since its invention and introduction to the market in (2008), Blockchain technology has received a lot of attention. Initially, Blockchain technology has been adopted in the digital finance sector starting with the crypto-currency transaction. However, some of the key principles of Blockchain technology, namely transparency, security, and accessibility, have the potential to disrupt almost every industry, including marketing (Rana et al., 2021).====Marketers are always trying to be early adopters of new technologies, in order to achieve customer insights, serve more contextually relevant content, or manage customer relationships. Despite the fact that Blockchain technology is still in its infancy, marketers are trying to leverage this technology in the near future (Singh et al., 2019a, Singh et al., 2019b; Ji and Tia, 2021).====The elimination of any intermediary between the parties involved in a business for financial and non-financial transactions is the main advantage of Blockchain technology. Blockchain technology, has already changed the world around us. The most important advantage of this technology is to remove the middleman. In this way, marketers can take advantage of this opportunity like never before (Gielens and Steenkamp, 2019; Nanda and Nanda, 2021).====To find out how marketers can better leverage Blockchain technology and how it will affect or optimise their work, research is needed. To the best of our knowledge, the effects of Blockchain technology are not yet studied in the transportation sector in general and air transportation especially (Rana et al., 2021; Morkunas et al., 2019).====The transportation sector is containing many companies, people, goods and related infrastructure that provide transportation services. This sector includes several companies including airlines. This sector is closely linked to profits and earnings. The air transportation sector is influenced by several factors such as fuel cost, labour cost and demanding transportation services, etc. (De Boissieu et al., 2021). The sector is directly dependent on the global oil price and the economic progress which affects travelling rate and international commercial transactions (Hayes, 2020).====The transportation sector can profit from applications of Blockchain technology (Paul et al., 2020). The adoption of Blockchain technology can solve the problems associated with the inability of companies to maintain accurate and timely records of who holds their shares, thereby reducing settlement time, speed of service, and transparency of the transactions being conducted. Blockchain technology offers new opportunities to facilitate the customer relationships (Fearnley and Soohoo, 2018).====The adoption of Blockchain technology will have a positive and significant impact on the air transport sector (Astarita et al., 2019). This technology is still in its early stages and is not yet fully utilized (Xiong et al., 2021).====We review some of the existing academic and practical knowledge in the air transport sector, to help researchers and practitioners identify practical implementation challenges facing Blockchain technology in a real-world scenario. The implementation of Blockchain in this sector makes it an opportune sector.====This study contributes to help understand the use of Blockchain in the airline industry. It aims to understand how the consumer accepts and adopts a new technology that will help to ensure security and transparency related to any type of transaction. Through Blockchain technology, companies can reduce costs by having efficient and automated processes so they can improve their relationships with customers (Gerstner et al., 2017).====Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a marketing strategy and communication tool helps consumers to know about airlines and build their attitudes (Keller, 2013). With Blockchain technology, CSR is an important issue that can affect consumer attitudes. However, there has been little research on the relationship between CSR and consumer resilience. As well, for the impact of consumer resilience on attitude formation for the consumer (Trkovsky, 2017).====To the best of our knowledge, no study addresses the effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the attitude and resilience of an airline consumer. Similarly, no study addresses the effect of consumer resilience on their attitude.====In order to explore the prospect of using Blockchain technology in the airline industry, and to address this gap, our research is based on a model which is among the first in the field that contributes to the development of a better understanding of the determinants of the real consumer behaviour of an airline company via Blockchain technology.====Our study is the first to demonstrate with real data from an airline service company the effects of Blockchain technology adoption on the dissemination of corporate social responsibility information. Similarly, to assess the impact of corporate social responsibility on actual consumer attitudes, intentions, and behaviors in a Blockchain-enabled environment. Our study is also the first to test a model based on the “technology acceptance model” to determine stakeholder acceptance of Blockchain technology with particular reference to corporate social responsibility and consumer resilience. This is a mixed model. This design has been overlooked in previous studies. This study fills that research gap.====In short, the objective of our research is to determine the explanatory factors of actual consumer behaviour using Blockchain technology with an airline company. Thus, we propose the following research questions to fill the existing gap:====This article presents the results obtained from an exploratory study using a quantitative methodology, based on a sample of 463 air travelers. The participants were selected on the basis of convenience sampling. The structural equation modeling method was adopted. The results showed that the corporate social responsibility of the Blockchain-based service positively influences consumer attitude and resilience. Consumer resilience positively influences attitude. Attitude positively influences consumer behavioural intention. Finally, behavioural intention positively influences actual consumer behaviour.====The outline of our paper is as follows. We start with a review of the existing literature on the main concepts. The model and arguments of the research hypotheses are then presented, along with the proposed methodology, results and discussion. Finally, a conclusion with theoretical and managerial implications, limitations, and possible future research will be outlined.",Does the corporate social responsibility of the service based on Blockchain technology affect the real behaviour of the consumer?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972200076X,14 July 2022,2022,Research Article,101.0

Based on its various applications, the UAV market has been segmented into the military, commercial, government and law enforcement, and consumer markets (Goldman Sachs, 2022). Among them, the Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) is developing rapidly due to its low cost, ease of operation, and easy purchase in general retail stores, which lowers the entry barrier for many users. By the end of May 2017, more than 772,000 drone owners in the US had already registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA predicts that the number of drones identified as model aircraft (hobby or recreational use only) will likely double in the next five years, from 1.1 million at present to over 2.4 million (FAA, 2018a). Business Insider (2018) predicted that the sUAS market was projected to reach $52.30 billion in 2025. However, basic aeronautical knowledge and awareness of responsibilities in shared airspace are not common knowledge, especially for recreational flyers. As sUAS are becoming increasingly popular among hobbyists, the risk of runway incursions between commercial aircraft and sUAS around airports is increased (Boselli et al., 2017).====UAS have the potential to create hazards to aviation safety, and the primary safety concern is the ability of a UAS operator to observe manned aircraft in time to prevent a mid-air collision between the UAS and another aircraft (DeGarmo, 2004; Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020a, 2020b). On March 22, 2014, the pilot of a U.S. Airways flight with 50 passengers on board reported a near midair collision with a UAS near the airport in Tallahassee, Florida (CNN, 2014). On April 18, 2016, it was reported that a British Airways flight with 132 passengers on board collided with a UAS during the final approach to London Heathrow Airport (BBC, 2016). UK Airprox Board, the entity that monitors near-miss incidents, said 70 drones came close to aircraft in 2016, more than double the number for 2015 (BBC, 2017). Between December 19 and December 21, 2018, a total of 115 drone sightings over the airport of London-Gatwick were reported to lead to the closure of its single runway. During the disruption, which lasted 33 h, over 1000 flights had to be canceled, thereby affecting some 140,000 passengers and estimated to have cost the industry up to EUR 64 million (USD 72.7 million) (EASA, 2021). Such incidents have also occurred in Taiwan. According to the statistics of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), the number of drones flying too close to airports and airplanes has increased annually since 2015, and as of March 2021, a total of 80 penalties have been imposed for entering restricted areas (CAA, 2021a). Increasing drone activities near airports introduce more severe airport safety management challenges (Zhang et al., 2020b). There are 23 airports and military airbases in Taiwan, an island country, thus, preventing drones from entering the restricted areas of such dense airports is a significant issue.====Unfortunately, regulatory adaptation is far slower than technological and economic development. In June 2016, the FAA issued the new Small UAS Rule (part 107), which requires sUAS to be registered and sUAS pilots to have the remote pilot airman certificate and pass the FAA-approved test if the sUAS is used for business or work. If used for recreational purposes, sUAS over 0.55lbs must be registered, but the operator does not need any permission from the FAA to fly (FAA, 2016). In Taiwan, the Civil Aviation Act was initially amended on April 25, 2018 to add a special chapter for drones; however, amendments of other related regulations and the practice of enforcement are still in progress. While the original implementation date was set for July 1, 2019, due to the difficulty of execution, such as the distinction of UAV management authority between central and local governments, law enforcement manpower and capabilities, and the dispute between the government and the user community over airspace where drones can fly, the CAA suspended the date until 2020. During this time, drones have been seen at Taipei Songshan Airport (TSA) and other airports in Taiwan, which have frequently caused an immediate shutdown of the airport. The regulation was officially implemented on July 19, 2021. The regulation of drone operation is a multifaceted issue, as imposing any form of restriction can negatively affect the market uptake of drones and hinder all its potential benefits for society and the economy (Perritt and Sprague, 2017; Ghasri and Maghrebi, 2021). Hence, the aim of this research was to develop a strategic thinking model and utilize a systematic combination method to help government and industry make better decisions to set up governance policy and safety management strategies.====This study combined the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), importance-achievability analysis (IAA), and zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) to develop management strategies for drones, as based on the four pillars of the ICAO Safety Management System (SMS). Section 2 reviews the literature on drone safety management and integrates the suggestions from aviation experts to develop SMS-based drone management strategies. Section 3 elaborates our methodology for conducting the systematic strategies evaluation. Section 4 analyses and presents the results of drone safety management strategies, including the importance and achievability rankings and planning analysis of strategies. In order to implement the practicality of the strategy, the resource allocation problem of the strategy execution is also considered under various resource constraints in different scenarios.

However, the ways found in the literature do not include the “security” variable as a decisive part of this process of choice. Thus, through a survey of Declared Preference carried out at the International Airport of Guarulhos/São Paulo (SBGR), the variable “security” was incorporated based on a ====, which contemplated attributes of greater consensus in the literature related to the choice of getting to the airport by ground. Based on the results of the statistical analysis, it is possible to affirm that security is as decisive a factor in choosing the kind of transportation as the time taken to arrive at the airport. Among these findings, it can be said that the concern with security is greater among lower-income passengers, but there is no evidence that men and women have different concerns about the subject.","The airport can be considered a complex system formed by interdependent subsystems in which the infrastructure available for ground access to the passenger terminal is relevant (Zimmermann, 2013).====Several factors can be considered critical when users choose an airport. As an example, we can mention the work of Beck et al. (2017), among others. Specifically, ground access is considered by many researchers as a critical issue for the airport system as a whole. Furthermore, it can be considered one of the main variables in the user's choice for an airport, because in certain regions where there is competition between airports, getting to the airport terminal easily and quickly can be the determining factor in choosing the airport (Malandri et al., 2017).====Thus, the passengers' choice of ground access to the airport can be explained by several objective and subjective features, according to the Consumer's Theory (Varian, 2006), which investigates how consumers buy, use and discard a given product or service. Hence, it is possible and plausible for each passenger to assign a level of importance to each attribute related to alternatives of ground access to a given airport.====Many theoretical models on how to access the airport were developed using Logit Models. These models employ in their input data personal variables of users such as age, income, and variables related to the trip, such as the amount of luggage taken, number of people traveling together, why they are traveling, among others. In short, the literature presents some results on the main attributes that explain passengers’ behavior when choosing the ground access alternative.====Tsamboulas and Nikoleris (2008) highlight that some types of passengers, such as business passengers, are willing to spend more on transportation to the airport if there is a reduction in their travel time. Additionally, the authors point out that users, in general, are more likely to spend more for a reduction in time compared to the possibility of another more comfortable means of access.====The results found by Alhussein (2011) show that the behavior of users when accessing King Khaled International Airport (RUH) was similar to their behavior when accessing American airports, where their cars represent more than 50% of the choice of access. In addition, the variables such as the user's income, amount of luggage, nationality, and time were decisive factors in the user's choice of ground access to the RUH.====The study by Jou et al. (2011) did not include data from foreign passengers or employees in their model. The authors state in the literature that it is very important to consider not only the time taken to get to the airport inside the vehicle, but also the time waiting outside of it in the variable of airport access time, as this time can make a lot of difference to reach the airport. In general, they also point out that the variable cost of the access is less relevant, mainly due to the option of not needing transfers and even the convenience of carrying luggage in some cases.====Regarding access time, Tam et al. (2011) raise a discussion about the reliability of the means of access related to its time. Although the database contains few observations about users who used their car or a taxi, the authors have two main contributions. The first is the reliability assessment, where they concluded that the lower the reliability in the type of transport, the greater the safety margin of time that the user needs. The second is to obtain the level of service perceived by the user regarding transportation to the airport in the model.====Akar (2013) uses the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a variable to help understand the users' profiles and, for this purpose, he proposes six alternatives for PCAs at the time of data collection, but he does not differ from other authors already mentioned who point out that the own vehicle is the predominant means of access to American airports.====A pioneering discussion on the choice of access for elderly users was made by Chang (2013). Although his database is not very expressive, the author infers that the main concern is related to security, the ease of using the means of transportation to access the airport, the lack of necessity of transfer during the route and the convenience of taking luggage in a trunk. Also, elderly users prefer going to the airport with a family member rather than a driver. This discussion may become more and more relevant over time, as the author points out data on the elderly population in general.====Gokasar and Gunay (2017) contributed to the theme by saying that the areas of influence of public transportation on the access to the airport are considered in their model because users have a wider range of options for airport access in these regions.====Zaidan and Abulibdeh (2018) agree with the ways to choose the type of ground access to the airport by the aforementioned authors and raise hypotheses for encouraging public transportation, as almost 60% of users said they were willing to use the subway. Thus, the author raises issues such as promotional subway tickets for families, since the number of people traveling together is an important variable for the choice of transportation, Wi-Fi on public transport boarding platforms, among other incentive strategies.====Finally, Birolini et al. (2019) aggregates the literature on the choice of ground access dealing with low-cost (LC) users, as LC users are known as sensitive to changes in airfares. However, LC users did not prove to be low-cost consumers regarding the choice of their access to the airport. Although the cost of access is a relevant factor, other concerns were also important, such as the level of service. Therefore, it is possible to infer that even at airports where low-cost airlines (LCC) are predominant, reducing public transportation costs to discourage the use of private cars is not feasible. It is also important to maintain a certain level of service demanded by this kind of user. However, models that consider security as a decisive attribute when choosing an alternative to access the airport have not been found in the literature so far, being security (Seidenstat, 2004), considered against illegal acts, for example, robberies, thefts, and violations of personal property. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relevance of the security attribute in a simultaneous analysis with other attributes on the choice of alternatives to ground access found in the literature. Thus, four hypotheses related to the security attribute were presented:====These results aim to contribute to the management of the demand planning for airport infrastructure, especially those where ground access is limited. Additionally, this study aims to cooperate with the sector's literature by filling a relevant gap on the issue of security, which is still little explored in studies on airports. Another important issue is highlighted by the hybrid model that was pioneered in this study, with the use of preference methods, conjoint analysis, and relative risks, seeking to achieve assertive and original results.",The role of security in passengers' airport ground access choices: A statistical evaluation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000655,4 July 2022,2022,Research Article,103.0

Our database is unique and very detailed in that we combine actual operation and scheduled flight data. We are particularly interested in the list of capacity constrained airports, their characteristics, and future development. To this end, we develop a classification matrix to investigate capacity constrained airports. We then forecast the demand and capacity of these airports under three scenarios and use the data as inputs for Monte Carlo simulation, to predict the capacity utilization trends of these airports in 2025 and 2035. Our research shows that: (1) There are significant differences between airports in terms of airport congestion status, and over 85% of airports in China experience no overload; (2) Big spatial differences are observed in the distribution of airports with less spare capacity and can be summarized as “more in eastern China and less in western China”; (3) Ten airports stand out as seriously capacity constrained and all of them serves as international or regional hubs; (4) Airport location, airport orientation, and linkage to the local economy are closely related to airport capacity constraints; (5) As most constrained airports are going to increase capacity in the future, as well as the outbreak of COVID-19 negatively affected aviation demand, most airports will have sufficient capacity reserves in the future. However, Shenzhen Bao'an and Xi'an Xianyang International Airport will face heavy capacity pressure. We also provide several recommendations to improve airport capacity utilization and relieve capacity shortages.","Air traffic demand has increased dramatically in recent years, and the growing trend will continue. The IIATA, International Air Transport Association, 2017 forecast that passenger numbers could double to 8.2 billion in 2037, with a 3.5% compound annual growth rate. Notably, the Asia-Pacific region will show the most prominent growth rate.====As one of the biggest markets worldwide, the Chinese aviation market has experienced rapid growth, yielding an average annual growth rate of 8.6% in annual aircraft movements from 2010 to 2019 (Fig. 1) (CAAC, 2010–2019). A continued high level of growth will lead to further growth in air traffic demand, and China is expected to displace the United States as the largest aviation market in the mid-2020s (IATA, International Air Transport Association, 2017). Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that several airports in China face airport capacity shortages, causing airport congestion and delays (Dixit and Jakhar, 2021; Zhang, 2010). Some of them reach their capacity only at specific peak periods, for instance, in some morning hours; however, some airports with high traffic volume experience much overload during the day, such as Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK). Also, we found that the average annual growth rate of aircraft movements for the top 10 airports between 2015 and 2019 fell behind the national average, which is associated with their capacity constraints. These ten airports (just 4% of all airports) handled over 43% of passenger transport in China.====Furthermore, airports are also local sources of environmental impacts as flight operation produces many greenhouse and pollutant emissions (Čokorilo, 2016; Hu et al., 2020; Masiol and Harrison, 2014; Simaiakis and Balakrishnan, 2010). As severe delays can increase fuel consumption and emissions (Evans and Schäfer, 2011; Upham et al., 2003; H. Zhang et al., 2020), identifying capacity constrained airports and finding appropriate ways to mitigate congestion is necessary and urgent for more sustainable development (Zhang and Witlox, 2020).====While the air transport industry has developed rapidly over the past decade, runway capacity in China is generally lower than in other (developed) countries due to safety priority policies and technical challenges (CAAC, 2020, 2016; MOT, 2018). Wake turbulence Re-Categorization (RECAT) is used in major European and United States airports, expected to increase runway throughput by 5% or more in peak periods (Eurocontrol, 2015). However, this procedure has not been introduced in any China's airports until the end of 2019. Thus, it is necessary to refine the measurement approaches to identify China's capacity constrained airports.====Meanwhile, the outbreak of COVID-19 has had an unprecedented negative impact on air traffic demand and brought significant uncertainty to the recovery and future development of the aviation industry (Truong, 2021; van Wee and Witlox, 2021). Aircraft movement volume in China declined dramatically in 2020, seeing a sharp decrease of 22.4% compared to 2019 while gradually recovering after that (Fig. 1). The number of domestic passengers exceeded the level before the outbreak in the second quarter of 2021 (CAAC, 2021) but was affected by renewed outbreaks. On the other hand, because of the travel restrictions, the “Five-One” policy (i.e., carriers are allowed to operate only one flight a week to one point in any country), the “Circuit Breaker” policy (i.e., if the number of passengers testing positive (test for COVID-19) on one flight reaches five, the airline's operation on the specific route must be suspended for two weeks, or the passenger load factor must not be over 40% for four weeks from the fourth week of the flight's arrival) and low confidence in international travel (Yu and Chen, 2021), the number of international passengers plunged by 98.7% in April 2020 and remained stagnant. Undoubtedly, the pandemic more or less relieves the capacity pressure of airports. However, IATA (2022) expects global air passenger numbers to exceed the pre-COVID-19 level in 2024 and anticipate growth in the long run. CAAC (2022a) also set goals to reach an annual movement volume of 17 million in 2025, and the value will further rise to 30 million in 2035, 2.6 times the pre-COVID level (Fig. 1). Therefore, many airports will still face capacity constraints in the future. Meanwhile, it is worthwhile to study the impact of coronavirus disease on demand for air transport and airport capacity utilization in the short and long term.====In summary, insight into airport capacity constraints is a pressing research question. Knowing the characteristics of those airports suffering or potentially suffering from capacity shortages will contribute to a better understanding of airport capacity utilization and how we can strike a good/better balance between “supply” (i.e., airport capacity) and “demand” (i.e., aircraft movements) in the future.====Therefore, this paper aims to identify and analyze the capacity constrained airports with a high degree of airport congestion relative to their potential capacity and forecast their capacity utilization status. To this end, our study sets four research goals. First, we develop quantitative indices to measure the degree of airport congestion. Second, we identify the capacity constrained airports from the perspective of the gap between “current demand” (i.e., the degree of airport congestion) and “potential supply” (i.e., the level of airport capacity available given current controls) and analyze the characteristics from this perspective. Third, we provide the outlook for future capacity utilization, considering the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we propose policy implications to help authorities improve airport capacity utilization.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of previous research on airport capacity. Section 3 introduces our methodology, and Section 4 states the data source. Section 5 provides results of capacity constrained airport identification, scenarios analysis for capacity utilization, and interpretations and discussions of the results.

However, certain negative aspects associated with code-share arrangements can displease passengers and cause them to negatively react to their preferred airlines. This study hypothesized various scenarios demonstrating code-share alliances between passengers' preferred airlines and other partners. Then, perception data from 547 Taiwanese airline passengers were collected, and ==== analysis was applied to discover the determinants influencing passengers' behavioral intentions. The results revealed that code-share partners from developing countries, passengers' awareness of code-share schemes, and the perceived risk of service inconsistency among code-share airlines are the key drivers influencing passengers' feelings regarding code-share strategies. Those feelings, good or bad, have clear connections with passengers' coping behaviors in terms of favorable or averse reactions. Additionally, trip purpose, travel type and ====, such as gender, age, and monthly income, have various degrees of influence on passengers' feelings concerning code-shared flights. Furthermore, managerial implications are discussed.","Code-sharing is a common marketing arrangement between two or more airlines. The arrangement enables one or more airlines that act as marketing carriers to sell seats on a flight operated by a different operating carrier (Alderighi et al., 2015; Gilo and Simonelli, 2015). This arrangement represents a basic form of collaboration among airlines, regardless of whether they are partners in the same airline alliance (Gerlach et al., 2016; Hethcock, 2015; Savaser, 2013; Zou and Chen, 2017). Code-share agreements are also present among low-cost carriers (LCCs) and between LCCs and full-service carriers (FSCs) (Corbo, 2017; Fageda et al., 2015; Klophaus et al., 2021; Morandi et al., 2014; WestJet, 2016).====Code-share arrangements enable marketing carriers to expand their service networks, flight schedules, and marketing channels without incurring the costs and risks associated with additional investment in their fleets and sales efforts in other countries. Such arrangements also benefit operating carriers by increasing the load factors and yields per seat (Alderighi et al., 2015; Brueckner, 2001; Gerlach et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2001; Zou and Chen, 2017) and on-time performance (Yimga, 2018). Code-share agreements between airlines are also beneficial for passengers in terms of one-stop check-in services, earning or redeeming airline mileage, more flight schedule options, and smoother flight connections (Burton and Hanlon, 1994; Hannegan and Mulvey, 1995; Janawade, 2013; Nolan et al., 2001; Weber, 2005). However, will passengers appreciate those benefits claimed by airlines with no concerns? Several studies have found that code-share agreements, such as the parallel code-share agreement developed between two or more airlines that competed and provided services on the same route prior to the collaboration, can reduce competition between airlines that are supposed to be competitors but become allies after joining in code-share agreements on the same route (Alderighi et al., 2015; Almkvist, 2014; Czerny, 2009; Gilo and Simonelli, 2015; Simonelli, 2012). However, this phenomenon may not be favored by passengers.====In addition, certain passengers are unaware of which airline(s) code share with or are allies of their preferred airline or what benefits they can enjoy (Weber, 2005). In particular, passengers may have misperceptions regarding the benefits of code-sharing (Goh and Uncles, 2003). Anecdotal evidence found on several popular travel websites and social media websites, such as ====, ====, and CNN Travel, indicates that taking a code-shared flight can lead to hassles for passengers, for example, through the inconsistent checked baggage policies among code-shared airlines, in-flight services being different from those of code-shared partners, and the impaired accumulation of frequent-flier mileage. These negative experiences drive passenger displeasure and frustration and encourage them to avoid taking such flights as much as possible. Therefore, limited awareness, incorrect perceptions, and/or negative emotions may transform passenger positive attitudes toward a preferred airline into negative attitudes. If negative perceptions remain, then passenger loyalty toward their preferred airline will decrease (Grégoire and Fisher, 2008; Tuzovic et al., 2014). This turn of events represents a loss for code-share airlines despite the operational benefits they gain from such agreements. Accordingly, how will passengers feel regarding flying on code-shared flights? How will passengers react to their preferred airlines if code-share with other partners?====This study investigates passengers’ perspectives regarding code-share agreements between airlines in terms of how passengers feel about taking code-shared flights and their coping behaviors. Subsequently, the profiles of various groups of passengers assembled based on their feelings regarding code-sharing are analyzed using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Taiwanese passengers who had taken at least one international flight in the past two years were selected for this empirical analysis.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The following section surveys the related literature and lays out certain code-share mechanisms that may affect passengers' perceptions. Section 3 describes the survey design and implementation for Taiwanese passengers. Section 4 discusses the empirical results from cluster and multinomial logistic regression analyses.

This represents a loss of 71.8 million passengers (====).==== and ==== note, the rapid expansion of social networks has changed how companies communicate, interact, and engage with customers. In this new way of communicating, social networks are now among the preferred means for companies wanting to listen to, address, and interact with their publics. The academic literature has therefore analyzed consumer interaction with social networks to obtain information about their ability to generate brand knowledge and brand engagement (====; ====; ====).====Nevertheless, despite recognizing the importance of using social media communication to maintain the relationship with the customer (====), only few studies have indicated what type of content strategy should be carried out as a way to maximize interactions (====; ====) and, as a consequence, the popularity, engagement and virality of what is reported by the brand (====; ====; ====; Rauschnabel et al., 2012) decreasing the feelings of uncertainty.====With these premises, the following research questions emerged:====Consumers are mainly concerned with the safety measures implemented, the requirements relating to the use of masks, maintaining a safe distance between passengers (by means of excluding from the sale the middle seats on the airplane), and the disinfection of aircraft between flights (====).

A computer-assisted thematic analysis was conducted using Reinert's method to quantify thematic classes and their prevalence statistically. The evolution of class predominance over time was also analysed. The results highlighted six major thematic classes in 2000–2019, with three reflecting methodologies (i.e., parameter estimation, time-based problems, and optimisation) and the remaining three characterising underlying applications (i.e., co-opetition, business models, and external stakeholder/social view). Classes found for 1973–1999 also discuss optimisation and co-opetition, with the remaining classes focusing on aviation developments in Europe and transportation systems in general. Classes found for 2020–2021 agreed largely to the period 2000–2019, albeit with more well-delineated classes on the COVID-19 pandemic and the connectivity and accessibility of air networks. A correlation of methodologies and applications (2000–2019) identified the ubiquitous use of ==== throughout applications and the underrepresentation of complex network analysis and ==== in applications associated with the business models and external stakeholder/social view classes. Temporal trends suggest a steady increase in discussions of the parameter estimation class and subclasses related to low-cost carriers in Europe, regional airports, and high-speed rail co-opetition, and a decrease in investigations of airline alliances, deregulation, and privatisation.","While air transport networks play a central role in trade, tourism, accessibility, and integration among regions as well as in social development and economic growth in general (Zhang et al., 2008; Fu et al., 2010), comprehensive studies of the subject have been scant with no empirical systematic literature review (SLR) being provided. The closest SLR available (Ginieis et al., 2012) offers a view of studies on the general topic of air transport published from 1997 to 2009.

With this gap in mind, this research aims to map (1) the many perspectives from which air transport networks have been examined in the literature from 1973 to 2021, (2) the overall prominence of discourses about such perspectives, (3) the temporal evolution of these discourses, and (4) the main approaches undertaken in these analyses, determined by correlating employed methodologies and applications.

However, current E-AMAN deployment is only limited to a horizon of 150–200 NM from the airport, restricting the window of opportunity for any early intervention, and the prediction of delay in TMA remains a challenge given the inherent uncertainties in the air traffic environment. In this context, this research work presents an approach for predicting, transferring and absorbing the flight delays and holdings from the highly constrained TMA to the en-route phase using both data-driven and optimisation techniques. First, a method is developed to estimate holding time and TMA delay from historical data. Next, a Machine Learning based prediction framework is developed to predict holdings and delays in the TMA, from an extended horizon of 300–500 NM from the airport. Finally, a heuristics-based optimisation model is developed for dynamic speed management to transfer TMA delays to the en-route phase. To demonstrate the model's efficacy, a case study for Singapore airspace is developed using associated one-day air-traffic data. Four sets of experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of the speed management framework under different flight cooperation levels. For the experiment with the highest number of cooperative flights, the implementation of dynamic speed shows a transfer of 179 min of TMA delay to the en-route phase, equivalent to 65% of the initial TMA delay. This results in an estimated fuel saving of 1524 kg along with a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 48000 kg. The findings demonstrate that E-AMAN, for extended horizon with predictive delay modelling and dynamic speed management, has the potential to manage TMA congestion and reduce fuel consumption and emissions, therefore mitigating the ====.","With the continuous growth of the air traffic in the world, alleviating airspace congestion and reducing the environmental impact, while ensuring both safety and efficiency, have become a world common interest. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aviation Benefits Report 2019 (International Civil Aviation Organization, 2019), air traffic is expected to more than double in the next 20 years. Even though COVID19 has led to a 60% decrease in total aviation passengers for the year 2020 (International Civil Aviation Organization, 2021), the Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasted that global air travel to return to pre-COVID levels by 2023 as more countries are opening up due to higher vaccination rate (International Air Transport Association, 2021). This growth will impact particularly the Terminal Manoeuvring airspace (TMA) operations, especially at the airports which are already operating at their maximum throughput capacity. In 2019, the delay resulting from TMA congestion in the United States has increased sharply by 41% as compared to that in 2010 (Federal Aviation Administration, 2021). The TMA is the interface that connects the en-route airspace and the airport control zone. It handles a complex and high volume of traffic as flights are funnelled through this airspace either climbing to cruise flight level after taking off or descending to land on the runway after leaving the cruise flight level. Therefore, TMA is often the bottleneck of ATM and optimising TMA operations will be vital in tackling the growth of air traffic.====Moreover, as airports will approach their physical capacity limits in terms of runway capacity and gate availability, the increase in air traffic demand will further aggravate the congestion levels in TMA if arrival flights are unable to be cleared to land on schedule. In 2010, issues regarding runway capacity accounted for only 8% of the delay in the TMA; that number had risen to 27% in 2019 (Federal Aviation Administration, 2021). To alleviate TMA congestion, new solutions should be offered. Extended Arrival Management (E-AMAN) is one such proposal designed as an update to the present AMAN system as part of the SESAR Program (Single European Sky ATM Research) (SESAR, 2014). E-AMAN supports ATC with the sequencing of arrival traffic in the en-route phase, which occurs considerably earlier than the AMAN horizon. The fundamental idea is to minimise aircraft holding time in congested TMAs by controlling their speed during the en-route phase, which is normally 180–200 miles away from the airport. Controllers in the upstream sectors, which may be in a separate control center, acquire system advisories to facilitate the pre-sequencing of an earlier aircraft. Controllers in the upstream sectors, which may be in a separate control center, acquire system advisories to facilitate the pre-sequencing of an earlier aircraft. Controllers put that advice into action by telling pilots, for example, to modify the aircraft's speed during the descent or even before top-of-descent, minimizing the requirement for holding and lowering fuel usage. Many cities, including Rome, Amsterdam, and London, have conducted E-AMAN validation experiments. Results from the experiments show that on average, there is an 8% reduction of aircraft's fuel consumption per flight. In addition, there is also a 90% reduction in the airborne holding time (SESAR, 2014).====Despite the significant benefits envisaged from deploying the E-AMAN, accurate prediction of flight arrival time/delays continues to be a problem, particularly in terminal airspace with complicated holdings and Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) procedures. Furthermore, by increasing the coverage radius to 500 NM in order to have a longer window of opportunity for E-AMAN deployment, the uncertainties in predicting arrival timings increase. In reality, errors in arrival time computation can cause a disruption in the aircraft landing sequence due to planes arriving outside of their anticipated arrival time, resulting in the re-generation of delays at the TMA.",Towards a greener Extended-Arrival Manager in air traffic control: A heuristic approach for dynamic speed control using machine-learned delay prediction model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000709,23 June 2022,2022,Research Article,108.0

Airlines could play an important role in achieving these as they facilitate air travel, offer employment opportunities, and provide other socio-economic benefits. On the other hand, air travel generates a series of socially and environmentally adverse effects. Finding a way to magnify the positive impacts and mitigate the negative ones is crucial given the projected growth of this sector. Action towards the SDGs might be a path forward but at present little is known about how individual airlines engage with the SDGs, a gap this research seeks to fill. Using the membership of the International Air Transportation Association (nearly 300 airlines), we examine airline reports, websites, and other published documents for explicit mention of the SDGs. Findings indicate that ∼30% of airlines show various levels of engagement and ∼50% refer to sustainability more broadly. Combining these results with a wide range of variables related to airline action and basic descriptors as well as government policy and regulation, we find that existing sustainability related actions taken by airlines (e.g., reporting to prominent sustainability indices and producing a ==== report) are strongly correlated with higher levels of SDG engagement. In addition, geographical location as well as ownership structure seem to impact engagement. These findings lead us to our main recommendation of developing partnerships across the sector to overcome clear barriers to engaging with the SDGs.","In September 2015, United Nation Member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a 15-year framework centered on the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the face of unprecedented global social, environmental, and economic challenges, this commitment marks a historic turn of events in collaboration of the global community. The agenda commits to a more prosperous and resilient future where the three dimensions of sustainable development are advanced in a balanced and integrated way, ‘leaving no one behind’ (United Nations Sustainable Development Group, 2022).====Successful achievement of the SDGs demands progressive and systematic partnerships with the private sector. To date, there are several sectors that have actively been engaged with the SDGs. The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) lists just under 14,000 companies which have committed to take actions from various industry sectors globally including: Oil and Gas, Chemical, Food and Beverage, Automobiles, Financial Services, Natural Resources, Telecommunications, Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Construction, Technology and Healthcare (United Nations Global Compact, 2019). However, in committing to support the SDGs, aviation trails behind in their support with approximately twenty airlines being active in their commitment to the SDGs through the UNGC (United Nations Global Compact, 2019====. The lack of involvement from the aviation sector through the UNGC is particularly problematic as the sector is in a unique position to support the achievement of virtually all the SDGs, including those associated with economic and social development, connecting goods with markets, supporting agricultural productivity and access to services (Air Transport Action Group, 2019). It should be noted that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic which spelled disaster for the aviation sector (IATA, 2020b) there is a renewed focus on some aspects of sustainability and the SDGs as the sector begins to rebound. For example, at the 2021 International Air Transport Association (IATA) General Meeting, those gathered committed to striving towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2025 (IATA, 2021), which is clearly linked to SDG 13 – Climate Action. This suggests the time is right to begin big conversations in the sector around engagement with the SDGs and sustainability.",Ready for take off: Airline engagement with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000667,17 June 2022,2022,Research Article,109.0

The study's finding points to external effective Inter-organizational IT links that can drive the business processes modularization of airlines and enable them to create new business process performance by recombining business processes. Airlines and travel agencies can quickly and flexibly create new processes to respond to the dynamic market challenge through IT initiatives.","Traditionally, airlines and travel agencies sell travel products through inter-organizational information systems and face market competition (Aamir and Atsan, 2020; Lee et al., 2019). Business process agility plays a significant role in the inter-organizational competition. Business process agility states that companies respond to market demands by redesigning existing processes and gain an advantage in uncertain market conditions (Kurniawan et al., 2021; Nazir and Pinsonneault, 2021; Pearson et al., 2015). According to the perspective of structure-conduct-performance (SCP), enterprises can gain a competitive advantage by developing or acquiring business process agility that is rare and valuable, cannot be perfectly replicated, and cannot be replaced by a unique combination (Keskin et al., 2021; Yeh et al., 2016). Because organizational capabilities usually lead to process dependence, causal ambiguity, and competition complexity, the competitive advantages generated by capabilities can ensure that firms can maintain their unique advantages over a more extended period.====There are specific gaps in the literature on organizational agility issues; first, previous research has focused on environmental uncertainty and found that solid dynamic capabilities are essential for fostering organizational agility (Lee et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2015). Second, some studies have explored firm-wide information technology (IT) capability for enhanced agility (Chen et al., 2015; Lu and Ramamurthy, 2011). Third, prior studies have explored the role of structured knowledge in developing high-quality services and products or reacting to new competitors’ emergence (Yeh et al., 2016). In the context of organizational agility, our current research examines how inter-organizational information systems function and how the linkage of IT capability and absorptive capacity affects business process agility.====The relationship between travel agencies and airlines is inseparable from the tourism supply chain system; they work together to gain a competitive advantage (Delgado and Mora, 2021; Holma et al., 2015; Raza et al., 2020). From the SCP perspective, resource development is essential for establishing firms that can obtain and maintain a competitive advantage (Delbari et al., 2016; Ralston and Blackhurst, 2020). Airlines collaborate with travel agencies to sell tourism products and service customers through global distribution systems (GDS); External IT linkage may help the travel agencies execute the information exchange and the correspondence, and the external cooperation partner timely contact. Moreover, SCP shows that firms can gain not only competitive advantages from the resources and capabilities they own and control but also from unique inter-firm processes or cooperation with passengers; thereby improving the client's absorptive capacity (Delbari et al., 2016; Song et al., 2018); these functions include understanding the client's business and characteristics, dedicated continuous communication programs with clients, and integrate significant functions within the client's business model.====Advances in information technology continue to bring airlines and travel agencies into close integration. In addition, in recent years, service-oriented logic and thinking about value-added and service co-creation have attracted extensive analysis. Firms have increased their recognition of service-centric business models and client-centric value added (Winkler and Wulf, 2019; Woo, 2019). Information technology also forces airlines and collaborating travel agencies to rethink their processes to match market challenges. Service-dominant logic fully mediates the relationship between a firm's technological capabilities and business process agility. In addition, as the firms demonstrate a stronger service-oriented competitive orientation, the positive marginal effect of service-oriented logic on its technical capabilities has also increased.====This research aims to investigate how external IT linkage, IT proactive stance, and analytic ability of IOS affect business process agility via the client's absorptive capacity.

The computational results indicate that the policy could be useful for air travel carbon emission reduction and biofuel usage improvement in China. These results and analyses provide insights to the authority for the tradeoffs between policy equity and carbon emissions reduction effectiveness, and airlines for profitability.","Since the reform and opening-up policies were introduced, China has experienced relatively long-period economic development, with a high average annual growth rate (9.7%) of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during 1978–2015 (Zhang and Zhang, 2018). The rapid economic growth has consumed massive resources and led to humongous carbon emissions (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016, Diaz and Moore, 2017, Qiu et al., 2020b). In 2020, China publicly promised to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 (Zhang et al., 2022). In the same year, China put forward a goal of the GDP per capita reaching the level of moderately developed countries in 2035. Therefore, how to collaboratively achieve carbon emission reduction and economic growth goals is crucial to the sustainable development of China (Liu et al., 2015a, Burke et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2020). As a significant part of society and economy in China, the aviation sector, especially the air travel, should also be a target for curbing carbon emissions and improving benefits (Gössling et al., 2019, Qiu et al., 2021). Under the pressure of the win–win goals which conflict with each other most times, the biofuels, most of which are used to blend with conventional fuels, has been increasingly studied in China, but more applications still are needed, which may in turn lead to further development of technologies to improve efficiency and lower cost (Hari et al., 2015, Moore et al., 2017, Cui and Li, 2020). Therefore, air travel biofuel usage improvement and carbon emissions reduction are essential for the sustainable development of China’s aviation sector and the achievement of win–win goals.====As a mainstream mechanism in carbon pricing initiatives, the carbon tax mechanism has been widely implemented or scheduled in many countries and areas (Gupta, 2016, World Bank, 2019, Bhardwaj et al., 2020, Hansmann and Binder, 2021). Abundant research has been conducted in a variety of fields, including air travel. For example, Tol (2007) adopted an international tourist flow method to show a carbon tax’s effect on jet fuel, revealing that this tax had a small effect on travel behavior by destination choice models. Mayor and Tol (2007) used the same method to study the carbon emissions and passenger demand response from a carbon tax’s use. Hofer et al. (2010) studied a carbon tax towards the US’s air transport, and found that the environmental benefits of the carbon tax would be cut with sizeable increases in the automobile traffic. Dray et al. (2014) studied the changes in visitor numbers and carbon emissions under a carbon tax in the air travel, and illustrated that this sector could mitigate emissions by implementing the carbon tax. Fukui and Miyoshi (2017) estimated a carbon tax’s influence on carbon emissions and jet fuel usage in the US airline industry with some interesting findings. Dixit et al. (2022) analyzed effectiveness of carbon tax and congestion cost in improving the airline industry greening level and welfare, and found that the carbon tax was an effective tool to drive airlines towards sustainable-operations. These excellent studies indicate that carbon tax policies could help curb air travel carbon emissions and promote biofuel usage in China.====With the increasing demand for carbon emission reduction in air travel, aviation biofuels have been an increasing concern. Meanwhile, there have been many studies that involve the development and application of aviation biofuels. For example, Nair and Paulose (2014) studied the increasing use of the algae biofuel in aviation fuels based on the green business models and provided a case study about the algae biofuel system for the aviation industry. Zhang et al. (2015) developed a controllable lignocellulose biomass transformation for aviation biofuels and presented a useful way for the development of green aviation biofuels. Edwards et al. (2016) examined the potential of the aircraft cost index to carbon emission reductions by a variety of aircraft models including different biofuels blending strategies. Wu et al. (2017) demonstrated a novel transformation of vegetable oils into aviation biofuels by a three-step catalytic process, which enriched the production mode of bio-jet fuels. Mofijur et al. (2022) proposed a new method to select microalgae strains for aviation biofuel production, and highlighted that microalgae-based fuel needed further modification to satisfy all aviation biofuel standards. These innovative works have provided various ways to produce and use aviation biofuels, and have enlightened this paper to adopt biofuel blending technologies as airlines’ carbon emission reduction plans for air travel biofuel usage improvement and carbon emission reduction in China.====Similar to other problems involving multiple stakeholders, a carbon tax policy implemented by the authority is often ineffective for air travel biofuel usage improvement and carbon emission reduction when only considering the authority level or the airlines level (Xu et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2020). Bi-level programming, which can allow for all stakeholders, has become an effective method to deal with stakeholders’ conflicts, and has been occupied to reach a balance between decision-makers in many cases. For example, Hanaoka et al. (2014) estimated the policy impact of new low-cost carriers’ entry on routes from hub airports in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to Manila airport by a bi-level model. Qiu et al. (2017) studied a bi-level programming-based carbon emission allowance allocation problem in air travel with a mixed mechanism for aviation carbon emission mitigation. Takebayashi (2018) applied a bi-level air transport model to analyze airport charges’ management for identifying an effective method that improved social welfare and attracted traffic flow. Li and Wan (2019) provided a bi-level model to estimate the originating air travel demand and its geographic distribution at an airport, and a case study was presented to show the effectiveness of the bi-level model. These successful bi-level programming applications have inspired this paper to study an air travel carbon tax setting problem (ATCTSP) in China by the bi-level programming for air travel biofuel usage improvement and carbon emission mitigation in China. This paper analyzes the ATCTSP from both the airlines’ and the authority’s perspectives. Especially, the emission reduction plan for the whole of each airline is considered, according with the actual conditions. Analyses of results about the ATCTSP are conducted to explore useful insights. These analyses reveal the effect of the expected carbon emission level on airlines’ profits, carbon emissions and biofuel usages in China. In addition, some key points are discussed, such as the effectiveness and equity of the carbon tax policy.",Carbon tax policy-induced air travel carbon emission reduction and biofuel usage in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000618,8 June 2022,2022,Research Article,113.0

BT is difficult to predict because it depends on many latent variables such as airport layout, taxiing procedures, airspace status, and weather events. There is some increasing interest among aviation practitioners in machine learning techniques to help predict complex and nonlinear relationships. Among them, several machine learning methods have proved their significant advantages. However, recent research showed that these methods may not be able to generalize at different origin-destination (OD) pairs and periods (i.e. spatial-temporal scales), which challenges their further application in practice. The main goal of this paper is to improve the spatial-temporal generalization of the BT prediction models using the stacking method. We select four busy OD pairs in the National Airspace System as the cases and model BT prediction on individual OD pairs using data from two periods. Following seven typical machine learning methods, we first investigate their performance in different OD pairs and different periods. The results demonstrate that they also fail to generalize at spatial-temporal scales in the BT prediction. Then, we propose a stacking model to predict flight BT. Compared with the previous methods, our stacking method is able to achieve promising generalization at various spatial-temporal instances. In addition, we analyze the feature importance on each OD pair and find that they may also vary with periods. In order to improve the computational efficiency, we also develop lightweight BT prediction models that are trained with fewer but more important features. Although they show promising prospects in the reduction of computational costs, analysts should be cautious since the feature importance may vary with periods and the neglected features with lower importance may play a key role in the real world.","Block time (BT) is a critical parameter of flight operations and air traffic management, which affects the on-time arrival performance of flights straightforwardly (FAA, 2022a). BT refers to the time duration between the gate departure and gate arrival time, including taxi-out time, airborne time, and taxi-in time (Coy, 2006). According to the scheduled departure/arrival time and actual time, BT falls into scheduled block times (SBT) and actual block time (ABT). Typically airline schedulers set SBT for a certain flight more than six months ahead of time (Deshpande and Ar ı kan, 2012). The operating conditions of the day and other dynamic factors determine the difference between SBT and ABT (Wang et al., 2019). As increasing congestion led to higher delays, airlines try to increase the buffer of SBT to absorb the delays that their flights are expected to experience (Wong and Tsai, 2012). Hence, SBT can be regarded as the sum of the buffer and unimpeded time (De Neufville et al., 2013). Due to the perturbation in the air traffic system including the ground and airspace congestion or severe weather condition, ABT, as a random variable, varies with the magnitude of the disturbance (Willemain, 2001; Allan et al., 2001; El Alj, 2003). In general, a longer ABT may be required for an operating flight when encountering traffic congestion after push-back (e.g., long runway queuing, detour due to unexpected severe weather) (Simaiakis and Balakrishnan, 2010; Sridhar et al., 2002). On the other hand, when the delay did not occur in the airborne or taxiing phase, the ABT is usually shorter than the SBT thus the unimpeded time can be achieved (De Neufville et al., 2013).====Enhancing BT predictability is important to decrease airline costs and improve the efficiency of airport and airspace operations (Hao and Hansen, 2014a). Accurate BT prediction allows airlines to make an informed decision about burning extra fuel to make up for the delay or adopting a fuel-conservative approach and accepting the delay costs (Kern et al., 2015). The trade-off between the costs of fuel and those resulting from delay is the essence to minimize the total cost of a flight (Marla et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2017). In addition, accurate BT information also enables airlines to coordinate the actions of ground handling personnel and equipment, reducing the wasted time and energy that results from mobilizing resources that would then have to wait for a delayed flight to arrive (De Neufville et al., 2013; Trabelsi et al., 2013). Likewise, surface resources allocation such as airport runway and gate assignment, and ground support equipment usage optimization could all benefit from a more accurate flight BT prediction (Narciso and Piera, 2015). For air traffic control, for instance, predicted BT is a key parameter of Arrival Managers (AMANs) for scheduling an inbound stream of aircraft to optimize the capacity utilization and flight efficiency (Tielrooij et al., 2015).====The BT is hard to predict because of stochastic and network effects in nature (Balakrishna et al., 2010). A great number of factors can impact BT during the gate-to-gate flight operation. The uncertainties associated with the dynamically changing airport and airspace operation such as weather phenomena also bring challenges for the accurate prediction of BT. The elastic behavior is due to the fact that BT could be adjusted (positively or negatively) by flying speed, taking alternate routes, and position in the departure clearance queue especially during busy hours of the airport. Moreover, from the network point of view, a flight BT is affected by other flights with shared resources directly or indirectly (Churchill et al., 2010). Hence, the accurate prediction of BT is a tricky issue.====In recent years, there is some increasing interest among aviation practitioners for machine learning (ML) techniques to help predict complex and nonlinear relationships (Carvalho et al., 2020). They need less prior knowledge about the relationship among different elements of the air transportation system, less restriction on prediction tasks, and can better fit non-linear features in traffic data. Among these studies, a number of ML methods including linear regression, neural networks, and ensemble learning have been attempted to be applied to flight delay prediction (Rebollo and Balakrishnan, 2014; Choi et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2019), arrival time estimation (Kern et al., 2015; Takacs, 2014; Kim, 2016; Ayhan et al., 2018), taxiing time prediction (Diana, 2018; Wang et al., 2021), etc. These models are usually built on the level of airports (Shao et al., 2019) or origin-destination (OD) pairs (Rebollo and Balakrishnan, 2014; Kim et al., 2016; Truong, 2021) based on historical data ranging from several months to several years. Existing research has proved that several algorithms such as Random Forests (RF) (Rebollo and Balakrishnan, 2014), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) (Ayhan et al., 2018), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) (Lambelho et al., 2020) have obvious advantages in the delay-related prediction problems. But the instability of these methods has also been highlighted in recent studies. Ayhan (Ayhan et al., 2018) used eleven ML models to estimate the flight arrival time in multiple OD pairs, and the results showed that different OD pairs may be suitable for different algorithms. That is, these algorithms lack desirable generalization ability at the spatial scale. Diana (2018) compared ten commonly used ML methods for taxiing time prediction in two periods (2015 and 2016) and found that the best-performing method may vary with periods. In other words, they fail to be equipped with remarkable generalization ability at the temporal scale to make them show well performance in different periods. Similarly, Sridhar et al. (2009) found that different ML algorithms are preferable for different seasons in terms of delay prediction. Selecting well-matched algorithms for modeling individual objects (OD pairs or airports) seems to be a feasible approach to remedy the weakness of spatial generalization. However, the model selection from numerous algorithms for quantities of airports or OD pairs in the level of air traffic system (i.e. the National Airspace System) is rather labor intensive during the development and maintenance of predictive system in practice. In addition, the fault of generalization ability at the temporal scale exacerbates this challenge. More specifically, the model that are selected based on its lower generalization error on historical data may not be able to adapt and react properly to new data in real-world application.====In this paper, we manage to use a novel stacking-based ensemble method to address the aforementioned problems. The four OD pairs in the National Airspace System (NAS) are selected as modeling objects. We introduce a set of features associated with basic flight information, temporal features, spatial state, and terminal weather by feature engineering based on the two-year operational data in 2017 and 2018. Considerations are also given to the correlations among BT on different OD pairs. To begin with, the seven most widely used regression algorithms in machine learning (Hastie et al., 2009), are elaborately selected based on their performance in related prediction problems (see Section 2 for a detailed literature review), including linear regression (LR), ridge regression (Ridge), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forests (RF), extra trees (ET), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). We compare and evaluate their performance at spatial-temporal scales and give a comprehensive understanding of their generalization for BT prediction. Based on the results of the model comparison, we attempt to integrate those models with their own advantages and introduce a stacking method aiming to improve the spatial-temporal generalization of BT prediction models. Finally, we analyze the feature importance of each OD pair in detail. Using feature reduction technologies, we further develop lightweight BT prediction models with fewer but more critical features, trying to decrease the computation costs while maintaining acceptable accuracy.====The contributions of this paper are four-folds. First, we verify that previous ML methods also face the challenge of temporal and spatial generalization in the BT prediction problem. Second, we develop novel stacking models, which can integrate the strength of multiple algorithms and improve spatial-temporal generalization performance for the BT prediction on different OD pairs. These improvements enable to reduce the cost of selecting models for various OD pairs, and diminish the risk of selecting unsuitable models based on historical data and thus enhance the BT prediction accuracy potentially. Third, we reveal that the features affect BT on different OD pairs to varying degrees, and the importance of a feature for an OD pair may also vary with periods. This insight means that analysts should be cautious when using historical data to select variables since the neglected features with lower importance may play a key role in practice. Last but not least, we propose lightweight models that are trained with fewer but more critical features, which provides the possibility to reduce the computational cost of the BT prediction model.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review previous work on BT prediction including its partitions such as taxiing time. Section 3 provides an analysis framework to determine the factors associated with BT estimation. Our data and methodology are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we present the performance of the proposed models and discuss the results.

Many governments continue to substantially subsidise or channel public funding towards the air transport sector, partly because in many markets it is still regarded as a public utility; this is especially so for non-commercialised routes (Gossling et al., 2017). In other cases, subsidies may mitigate the environmental impacts of the aviation industry (Whitelegg & Williams, 2001) and be vital for economic development (Forsyth & Guiomard, 2019). As the aviation industry has evolved due to deregulation and liberalisation, different government subsidy programmes have emerged to improve air accessibility and support flight services to remote and regional destinations or non-commercial routes (Allroggen et al., 2013; Fu & Kim, 2016; Mills & Kalaf-Hughes, 2017). For example, the US introduced the Essential Air Services (EAS), the European countries introduced Public Service Obligation (PSO), and Australia introduced Regional Aviation Access Programme (RAAP). These programmes promote air services to rural and regional communities, including those routes that are otherwise non-commercially sustainable (Hromadka, 2017; OECD, 2004). The US′ EAS was established as part of 1978 Airline Deregulation Act and had a 10-year remit. It has been renewed and refunded since 1988 after periodic reviews and monitoring by the US Department of Transportation and other government agencies (such as the US General Accountability Office). The US EAS programme provides support for small and rural communities through a tendering process. The EU PSO was introduced during the liberalisation policies and was applicable since 1993. The EU PSO programme provides support for regional aviation through support to the airport operators, airline operators or directly to residents for 11 European countries. Such a framework is administered by their respective governments. The EU PSO differs from countries and communities but PSO often prioritise the access for and to communities (Merket & O'Fee, 2013). Although the RAAP was introduced in 1983 in Australia, the Australian government had already been subsidizing the remote air services since 1957. This indicates that the subsidies are addressing some essential and long-term needs, and aviation subsidy programmes continue to evolve as the aviation industry develops (Hazledine & Collins, 2011).====Aviation subsidy programmes collectively aim to support a sustainable aviation sector, and a wide range of aviation subsidy programmes have been implemented by different governments (Fageda et al., 2018; Gossling et al., 2017). Because of the nature of the aviation industry and its vulnerability to external factors, governments offer ‘bailout’ or ‘stimulus subsidies’ during financially difficult periods for aviation operations (Law, 2017). For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented reduction in air travel demand (IATA, 2020). This pandemic emphasised the vital role of government subsidies (e.g. direct cash capital injections, debt write-off programmes, and non-repayment obligation loans) to support the air transport sector. Aviation subsidies have attracted a lot of controversy and debate amongst airlines, airport operators, and academics (Abeyratne, 2017; Tretheway & Markhvida, 2014). There are concerns about unfair competition among airlines (Forsyth, 2007; Lumbroso, 2019; Santana, 2009) and airports (Duesterberg, 2018; Law, 2017) that are related to various government subsidies. Therefore, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) established guidelines to address these issues and encourage fair competition in both domestic and international markets (Abeyratne, 2016). Similar initiatives have been pursued at regional level.====Although there is a wide range of literature on various aspects of aviation subsidy or incentive programmes in different countries, attention is lacking within the Oceania region, including the South Pacific Region (SPR) (Wu et al., 2020). Therefore, the impacts of aviation subsidies in this region are still unclear. Geographically, the SPR small island countries are isolated from the rest of the world. They also have emerging economies, limited natural resources and relatively small populations scatted around the Pacific Ocean. The SPR==== is an under-examined region with a limited number of studies on aviation development compared to other well-studied regions such as Asia, the European countries, and the US. Rather limited data were available concerning government subsidy programmes related to the aviation sector in SPR countries. The air transport literature highlights the paradox of the significance of the aviation industry to remote, regional and isolated communities, although such services are often not financially viable for airlines and airport operations (Bowen, 2010; Mendes et al., 2011). Prior studies within the SPR are primarily descriptive, with only three quantitative studies examining aviation development and government subsidies (Cheer et al., 2018; Forsyth & King, 1996; Taumoepeau & Kissling, 2008). In particular, Taumoepeau and Kissling (2008) suggested that the aviation industry of the SPR needs government subsidy programmes. However, to our best knowledge, no prior studies have proposed any practical government subsidy frameworks or approaches to support the SPR's aviation and tourism sectors and economies. This indicates significant gaps in air transport research in relation to aviation subsidies in the SPR and, more importantly, a lack of guidelines for implementing, updating and regulating the aviation subsidy programmes in general. This gap prompts this study to propose a framework for governments and stakeholders in SPR countries to formulate and design effective aviation subsidy programmes and policies, which is essential for the region to develop aviation services (airlines and airports) and promote tourism growth, as well as economies in SPR countries. Therefore, this study focuses on the following three research questions:====This study aims to contribute to the literature by conducting a cross-national and cross-sectional analysis via interviews with key stakeholders to examine the impacts of aviation subsidies in the SPR's aviation development and tourism growth. The study offers insights by examining views from various participants in SPR countries across multiple sectors, such as airlines, airports, aviation authorities, tourism authorities and operators, regional organisations, environmental experts and academics. Importantly, this study paves the way for future studies in the SPR's aviation subsidy.====To contextualise these questions further, the next section outlines how the existing literature fails to empirically examine aviation subsidies in the SPR on Section 2. Section 3 provides an overview of the SPR. Section 4 details the qualitative approach (i.e. interviews with key stakeholders of aviation subsidies). Section 5 presents the results of this study. Section 6 provides a discussion and the policy implications of the results.

Today, it is common to use ====, messengers, and review websites to receive data from customer opinions. But analyzing the data received from these sources due to their huge volume requires an efficient tool. In this study, textual data obtained from the reviews of passengers of the top 10 airlines in the Middle East region have been analyzed and evaluated. First, we identified the main topics that are hidden in the customers' reviews by topic modeling method. In the next step, we evaluated the level of passenger satisfaction based on the topics identified in the modeling stage, by using sentiment analysis on passenger reviews to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the airlines in providing various services to customers. In the end, management solutions and recommendations are provided to airline managers. The proposed method is a new approach for evaluating customer satisfaction and can be used as a guide for airlines to develop marketing strategies to attract new customers and increase their market share.","Nowadays, many manufacturers, organizations, and service providers require customers' reviews and feedback to evaluate their products and service quality (Greer and Lei, 2012). In the past, there were different direct methods to learn about customers' opinions on products via interviews, questionnaires, surveys, text, phone, and email messages. However, these methods of communication have changed due to the recent advances in information technology and increased use of the internet and its availability to the public resulting in utilizing innovative and modern methods of communication with customers (Jin et al., 2016; Raeesi Vanani, 2017; Riaz et al., 2019). This has, in turn, enabling access to a new source of customer information that decreased the need to direct communication with the customers. For instance, social media, messengers, online groups, public and private channels as well as various websites can gather customer opinions on specific topics or industries. Thanks to the comprehensive information relevant to the topics on these websites, it becomes possible to suggest vast and broad data in areas such as marketing and customer service and customer relations and management to the audience (Park et al., 2019; Sohrabi et al., 2012). The data covers not only the general opinion on products but also the customer's specific comments and expectations.====The airline industry requires to continuously monitor and analyze the customer reviews on its service. In previous articles, researchers have explored various aspects of airline passenger services. Tsafarakis et al. (2018) used MUSA (Multicriteria Satisfaction Analysis Method) to measure passengers' satisfaction with several service features in Aegean Airlines and to identify the features that need further improvement. Unlike other methods, the MUSA method utilizes the qualitative form of satisfaction data and does not involve robust assumptions about the satisfaction or behavior of customers (Lachnidaki et al., 2021). The model system is based on a multicriteria analysis (aggregation-disaggregation method and linear survey-based software) which can deliver useful results by evaluating explicable indices of customer satisfaction. Passengers were invited to rate their experience with Aegean airlines via some surveys comprising a set of criteria. The results of this modeling research revealed that customers are dissatisfied with the ticket price and the extra charges. In some studies, even the gender factor has been studied, the impact of gender of passengers on the airline industry was studied by Kurtulmuşoğlu et al. (2018). The study addressed important service factors prioritized by female and male passengers by rating the airlines based on the proposed method in a linguistic framework. The review of airlines has been a controversial topic for the airline industry, and there is a need for robust data evaluation due to a variety of passengers’ expectations. As such, data analysts in this industry are greatly involved inefficient data gathering and assessment based on customer reviews.====On the other hand, with the evolution of artificial intelligence and related disciplines such as machine learning, the application of computer processing methods using mathematical algorithms has increased to understand the hidden patterns in data, which is known as data mining (Hanafizadeh and Paydar, 2013; Raeesi Vanani, 2019). Among the data that can be processed is textual data that can be used to identify hidden knowledge in texts using a variety of text processing methods. Hong and Park (2019) have used text mining of airline review data for evaluating marketing and corporate performance. They suggested a procedure that contains the process of extracting the most repetitive keywords by text mining methods and grouping them into different clusters. A combination of measurement and clustering techniques to analyze content related to the keyword extraction method, including text data from other scientific literature was utilized. The major finding of the research was believed to be the usefulness of keywords to show distinctive features. Moreover, the most repetitive keywords were found to be those extracted from text mining. Based on the results obtained, the author suggests that factors such as “recommendation” and “satisfaction” better be managed distinctively in the area of service management of the airline industry. Text mining and its related analyses such as sentiment analysis can help researchers working on opinion mining to understand the consumers’ opinions on products and services more effectively and timely than before (Ravi and Ravi, 2015).====Furthermore, natural language processing is another discipline of artificial intelligence focusing on interactions between humans and computers via natural language. Majority of natural language processing methods that try to recover and understand the meaning of human languages are based on artificial learning techniques (Vanani and Majidian, 2020). However, the technique used in this study involves the initial identification of remarkable and important topics in the reviews of airlines’ customers who recorded their comments on ==== using topic modeling. Topic modeling is a type of probably produced model which has recently been used in computer science mainly by utilizing text mining and recovering information (Sohrabi et al., 2018; Vayansky & Kumar, 2020). The topic modeling techniques are statistical analysis methods that analyze words in the text and find the topic of the text, they can also reveal the relations of different topics and how they change over time (Bastani et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014). These techniques do not need any preliminary assumptions about the topics or text labels and their inputs are main and raw text; they are classified as unsupervised algorithms (Korfiatis et al., 2019).====In this paper, firstly three standard topic modeling algorithms were compared to find the most appropriate topic modeling algorithm for all data of this research. Next, the winning algorithm was selected based on the determinant coherence score, which is defined as a factor to measure the efficiency and quality of topic modeling.====The modeling was carried out by finding prominent topics that were used as the input parameters of the model. The next step involved the identification of related words and labeling them as a topic for each group of words, which determines the titles of the prominent topics. After identifying the main topics found in the reviews using the above process, an assessment of the level of customers’ satisfaction with the services provided by each airline was aimed. To achieve this, the polarity measurement process was used. In this process, the final results of negative and positive comments for each topic were calculated, and eventually, the final score which demonstrates the level of customer satisfaction about each topic was obtained. Considering the contents of this section, it is necessary to provide research questions to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. The research questions are as follows:====To answer the questions of the article, there is a requirement for a specific procedure of data extraction and its preprocessing to select the optimal model with appropriate input parameters to identify prominent topics and then adopt a passenger feedback system for evaluating airline services to provide management solutions.====In conclusion, the purpose of this study can be summarized as follows: First of all, identifying the prominent topics that airline passengers pay attention to during their trip, as well as measuring the level of satisfaction with the services received.

The success of airport development programs often depends on the support of airport community residents. To maintain collaboration among all these stakeholders, airport and regulator officials need to understand residents’ sentiment to anticipate issues and concerns before they turn into problems that can stall important capital projects. It is not unusual to see runway construction projects run over decades and eventually get canceled.====This study uses the example of a large hub airport in the Northeast of the United States. The case is representative of the issues and problems that airport community residents experience in their engagement with the airport authority, the regulators, elected officials, and community leaders. The article illustrates how residents' sentiment expressed in digital prints can be leveraged to inform decision-making in community engagement. As agents face an uncertain environment, they must re-assess their strategy with little knowledge of the magnitude of benefits or losses related to their policy implementation. The literature on Reinforcement Learning often emphasizes the agent's choice between ‘exploiting’ a situation or ‘exploring’ new alternatives (Sutton and Barto, 2018; Winder, 2021).====This article establishes a link between two of the fastest-growing areas of Machine Learning (ML), which is a division of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Humans use natural language in the forms of text, speech, and sign as opposed to programming language designed for computers. Sentiment analysis as part of NLP includes the study of sentiment, opinion, intent, and emotion to explain attitude and behavior. RL focuses on how agents (humans or entities) learn from their environment to derive rewards. The digitization of newsprints and social media has made it possible to take advantage of sophisticated ML algorithms, which can provide insight into how agents behave and select courses of action.====After defining the concepts of sentiment analysis and community engagement, we will delve into the ‘multi-armed bandit’ (MAB) problem and the concept of ‘contextual multi-armed bandit’ (CMAB) that adds the significance of the environment in an agent's strategy selection. Then, we will apply a classification model to determine how the selected features described in a later section can predict the choice of one of three policy categories:====The topic of community engagement and outreach is of great interest to aviation practitioners because agents as individuals or organizations must often make important decisions in a context of uncertainty. Sentiment can shift unexpectedly due to circumstances that may be beyond agents' control. This article offers a unique perspective on the relationship because no research to the author's knowledge has explored the interactions between sentiment analysis and RL in the context of airport community engagement. Diana (2021) studied how sentiment analysis could help anticipate residents' attitudes based on changes in key operational factors. It showed that operational factors such as the use of specific runway configuration, ceiling, and visibility could predict variations in the sentiment of airport communities.====Secondly, this article proposes a methodology to select a policy based on a classification model. The approach can be replicated by other airports or regulators in managing community involvement.",Using sentiment analysis to reinforce learning: The case of airport community engagement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000497,24 May 2022,2022,Research Article,117.0

Therefore, we present in this study a hybrid approach for optimal deployment of a weather radar network (WRN) over Algiers Flight Information Region (FIR) airspace in view to achieve maximum radar coverage. Our proposed model, coined CM-NNGA, leverages a genetic algorithm (GA) to explore significant and complex spaces of possible solutions with a modified neural network (M-NN) method to escape local optimums. The digital elevation model (DEM) that represents the spatial solutions is discretized into a grid system, where each cell represents a feasible solution. The maximization of a WRN coverage is achieved by minimizing of partial beam blockage (PBB) given several constraints, namely the ground elevation, the radar beam elevation and the distance between any two pairs of radars. To reduce the computational time, skipping schemes are employed. The results show that the proposed method performs qualitatively superior to selected state-of-the-art algorithms, with a somewhat higher computational time consumption, especially for large areas.","In the coming years, air traffic, regardless of the temporary Corona pandemic (COVID − 19), will experience congestion in an airspace according to Eurocontrol's challenges of growth 2018 reportEUROCONTROL (2018a), which requires continuous surveillance to regulate the movement of aircraft on the ground, around busy airports with the intensive control of the airspace en route. When air traffic is confronted with severe weather phenomena such as storms, especially in congested airspace, the Air Traffic Controller's (ATC) workload increases considerably Welch et al. (2013) and generates a relatively high level of delay Borsky and Unterberger (2019). For example, in Europe, the average en-route delay in 2018 was 116%, double that of 2017, a significant part of which can be attributed to bad weather conditions EUROCONTROL (2018b). In an attempt to minimize this cost, Eurocontrol relies on a Network Manager (NM) EUROCONTROL (2018b) capable of meeting the needs of air traffic in a particular weather event. Whereas, in the United States of America (USA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently adjust flight routes according to guidelines specified in the national playbook, which is a collection of severe weather avoidance plans (SWAP) Robinson and Evans (2006).====The weather radar system is one of the most crucial sensors to assist ATC in ensuring the safety, regularity and efficiency of air navigation Roeder et al. (2005). It is used as a support tool to avoid collisions on standard initial departure (====) and standard terminal arrivals routes (STAR). The risk of collisions becomes more complicated during poor visibility or flight paths over their FIR, requiring the issue of alerts on weather conditions that could adversely affect operations and facilities of the airport. This regard enables strategic and tactical planning of a safe flight path, requesting and approving new oceanic routes, flight level changes and optimal cruising speed. However, this benefit depends on identifying suitable radar sites that meet certain technical and regulations requirements. The importance of WRN for studying regional weather phenomena in complex terrains was thoroughly discussed in Colle and Mass (1998). In Berne and Krajewski (2013), some of the challenges of using weather radar in hydrology (mountainous precipitation) were presented. It was also noted that the use of WRN poses a more significant challenge for several factors, including the extreme complexity of the operating terrain. In Kucera et al. (2004), it has been shown that radar beam blockage analysis based on topographic information can be a valuable tool for climatological and hydro-meteorological studies. In the USA, the national weather surveillance radar −1988 Doppler (WSR − 88D) operational radar network suffers from severe beam blockage (e.g., Westrick et al. (1999); Young et al. (1999); Maddox et al. (2002)).====Similarly, china's next-generation weather radar (CINRAD) needs unobstructed visibility to reach intended destinations with optimal strength to detect precipitation Min et al. (2019). As previously mentioned, blockage by local terrain would significantly impact on limiting radar coverage. Therefore, the need for a clear line of sight (LOS) of the radar beam for an altitude of less than 1 km (1 km) without inter-visibility by topographic features is essential because the core of precipitation lies within, as emphasized by Wilson et al. (1980).====To achieve better coverage of WRN in areas of demand, optimal locations need to be assigned as sitting sites for new or existing WRs. Several models have been developed to solve the forecasting problem by optimizing weather radars locations and emergency management. There are relevant examples in the literature with different types, namely the local search Boudjemaa (2015); Kurdzo and Palmer (2012); Boudjemaa and Oliva (2019), constraint model Minciardi, Sacile and Siccardi (2003), and geographic information system (GIS)-based model Domenikiotis, Dalezios and Faraslis (2010); Boudjemaa et al. (2019) (discussed in detail in section 2). The local approaches have produced a solution of reasonable quality in an acceptable computational time. Despite this, no method can guarantee the global optimality of the obtained solution due to the complexity of the problem and the low performance of the meta-heuristics algorithms. This paper attempts to mitigate this problem by hybridization genetic algorithm (GA) and a modified neural network algorithm (M-NN). This approach, called Co-active Modified Neural Network and Genetic Algorithms (CM-NNGA), aims at improving a WRN coverage of a pre-defined geographical region by the elimination or reduction of PBB of each WR to satisfy ATC requirements.====Given a finite set of observer locations that represent the number of weather radars placed over a section of terrain that indicates demand points. The optimal weather radar network (OWRN) is modelled by covering the maximum grid points under specific constraints such as terrain blocking, radar beam elevation and the distance between any two pairs of radars. A reduced target resolution strategy Heyns (2020) is applied to decrease the computation times of the CM-NNGA approach. The proposed method is examined using 2 different scales, and its efficiency and superiority are highlighted against five other meta-heuristics algorithms, namely the GA Deb et al. (1995); Deb (2000), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Eberhart and Kennedy (1995), NNA Sadollah et al. (2018), Lévy Flight distribution (LFD) Houssein et al.

We find that the ARJI-trend model captures the short- and long-run impacts of COVID-19 and ESG on stock return dynamics. Moreover, short-run stock return volatility converges to the original equilibrium level faster when a company has a higher ESG score, implying that promoting ESG does offer a defense mechanism to airline companies and that ESG performance is suitable for integration into business operational goals. The results lay the groundwork for understanding how an ESG focus might help airline companies to suffer less of an economic/financial impact during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","The worsening novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic culminated in a black swan event====).

The disastrous effect that the outbreak of COVID-19 had on the airline industry in late 2019 and early 2020 is a solid testing ground for analyzing whether a firm's strong ESG performance offers another important function, defensiveness, to moderate stock return volatility during such a crisis period as reducing return volatility is a major concern of shareholders and potential investors when setting their investment objectives and making trading decisions. The other U.S. airline companies are excluded from our study, either because their revenue rankings fall far behind these top four or because their operating policy centers more on domestic air routes.

CE is a production and consumption system that essentially focuses on maintaining products, components, materials and energy in circulation in order to continue maintaining, adding and recreating value for as long as possible (Jabbour et al., 2020). In this context, the CE proposes an approach to materials and energy that can provide economic, environmental and social benefits (Millar et al., 2019); especially when companies gradually replace their traditional perspective of acquisition, manufacture, use and disposal, also known as a linear economy, towards circularity (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017).====The adoption of CE is recommended following criticism of the linear model, which causes issues such as increased pollution and deforestation, reduction of natural resources and loss of biodiversity, among others (Sauvé et al., 2016; Homrich et al., 2018). The adoption of CE has the potential to mitigate these criticisms as it proposes actions to close the loop of material and biological systems (Bocken et al., 2016). The incorporation of concepts such as CE in the production process, as well as the development of new environmentally sustainable products, has proved to be a challenging task in various industrial sectors worldwide (e.g., Geng and Doberstein, 2008; Stewart and Niero, 2018).====There are several reasons to explore the application of CE in the aerospace industry. Investments in science and technology in this industry are usually high (Balli et al., 2018); more than half a million components are needed to build a large aircraft (Raj and Srivastava, 2018); numerous processes are involved in the manufacture of these components, which comprise various materials with great polluting potential, such as metals, plastics, composites, chemicals and fabrics (Raj and Srivastava, 2018). Pierrat et al. (2021) also observed that only 1% of the energies used in the aeronautical sector are renewable, which also suggests a high use of fossil fuels for the sector.====There are currently more than 8500 unused commercial aviation aircraft (Zhao et al., 2020), with a significant expansion forecast of this number in the coming years (Raj and Srivastava, 2018; Krauklis et al., 2021). In addition, the recycling possibilities of the various parts and materials of an aircraft have been drawn the attention of several studies (e.g., Asmatulu et al., 2013; Zahedi et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021). In this regard, Zhao et al. (2021) suggest that this recycling potential could be up to 85% of an aircraft's total weight. Fig. 1 illustrates an overview of the environmental impact of the product life cycle, which can also be applied to the aeronautical sector.====Furthermore, the aerospace industry plays a significant role in the global industry, standing out as one of the largest consumers of fuel in the transportation area (Huang et al., 2016). This industry has also recently set a climate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (ATAG, 2021). This goal involves the commitment of different actors of the aeronautical sector such as aircraft manufacturers, airlines, air traffic management, airports, among others (ATAG, 2021). Additionally, policies developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), especially the CORSIA program (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) expect to stabilize CO2 emissions from international aviation as of 2021 (IATA, 2021).====Studies and applications of CE have been carried out in various sectors, such as electric and electronic equipment (Kasulaitis et al., 2019), automotive (Kalverkamp and Raabe, 2018), consumer goods (Stewart and Niero, 2018) and packaging. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have tackled issues related to the CE in the aeronautical sector (Hallstedt et al., 2015). Considering that the application and acceptance of CE practices by the industry remain limited (Linder and Williander, 2017; Stewart and Niero, 2018) and the environmental potential that the adoption of circular practices in the aerospace industry has as a benchmark for other industries, the objective of this study was to explore the possibilities of CE application in the aeronautical sector.====The understanding and adoption of CE for the aerospace industry can contribute to better operational and environmental performance in this industry, since there is a need for the aerospace companies to reduce its environmental impact; and the more conventional approaches have focused on increasing the efficiency of aeronautical engines and the use of alternative fuels (Balli et al., 2018), and still little is known about how CE can be adopted in the aerospace industry. By proposing strategies for closing material cycles (Bocken et al., 2016), CE is a recommended approach for improving environmental sustainability (Jabbour et al., 2020) and increasing the life cycle of products (Mesa et al., 2018). In addition, the adoption of CE has the potential to generate economic and productivity gains resulting from the optimization of materials and reduction of waste (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017; Moric et al., 2020). Thus, the adoption of CE also has the potential to contribute to the better performance of the aerospace industry.====Therefore, we understand that this study makes two contributions to the field. The first is to offer a theoretical discussion of CE practices adopted in the aerospace industry through the Circular Economy's ReSOLVE framework (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015; Mendoza et al., 2017; Jabbour et al., 2020). The second contribution is an evaluation of this proposed framework in companies in the aeronautical sector. We have therefore formulated the following research question: ==== In order to answer the research question, we developed a theoretical framework based on a literature review of the themes. This framework was then evaluated in three different sized companies in Brazil that develop and manufacture aeronautical products.====This article is structured in six sections. Section 2 presents the theoretical review on CE in the aerospace industry. Section 3 describes the research method used. Section 4 presents the results based on the proposed theoretical framework and its evaluation in the companies. Section 5 discusses the results.

Wang (2012) illustrates that there have been three waves of merger activities in the U.S. airlines industry in the 1980s, 1990s, and late 2000s. The latest merger wave started with the merging of America West Airlines and US Airways in 2005 and continued with the acquisition of Northwest Airlines by Delta Airlines in 2008, Continental Airlines by United Airlines in 2010, and AirTran Airways by Southwest Airlines in 2011. The last merger wave ended with the announcement of the merger of US Airways and American Airlines in 2013. ==== was officially granted a single operating certificate in 2015. Clougherty (2002) demonstrates that there are two views in the literature to address airline mergers’ drives: (i) efficiency gains and (ii) market power gains. The scholars who support the first view claim that efficiency gain is achieved by reducing the cost of saving in airport operations, information technology, and supply chain management. The second view states that market power is gained due to a reduction in the number of competitors in the market and to enhance the ability to raise fares. Manuela et al. (2019) state that higher market power gain reduces profits and using traditional indicators such as Herfindahl-Hirschman index is not sufficient in assessing market power. In this paper, we study the efficiency of U.S. airlines' pre-and post-merger which has a bearing on both views.====For this purpose, we consider 12 U.S. airlines (with four inputs, two intermediates, and two outputs) for the period of 2005–2018 to study the influence of the merger on the efficiencies. We introduce each airline as a two-stage network (2SN) system. In the first stage, maintenance, salary and benefits, fuel cost, and fleet size are the inputs to produce the two intermediates: available seat miles and available ton-miles (as the outputs of the first stage). In the second stage, the available seat miles and available ton-miles are considered as inputs to produce the two outputs: passenger miles revenue and ton-miles revenue.====In order to measure the stage and overall efficiencies, we propose a new two-stage network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) model in variable returns to scale (VRS) approach that is suitable for our dataset. DEA is a well-known linear programming approach that relies on very few assumptions such as free disposability, returns to scale, and convexity. It was first proposed by Charnes et al. (1978) in constant-returns to scale (CRS) and has noticeably been developed by many researchers in many different areas and aspects. A large number of previous studies employ DEA to estimate the efficiency in the airline industry (For instance see survey on the DEA applications within the last four decades in Emrouznejad and Yang, 2018).====For the first time in the DEA literature, we adopt the approach of Färe et al. (1992) for our two-stage VRS NDEA model to measure the variation of efficiency over different times. In DEA, the variation of efficiency over different times is measured by the Malmquist index (Färe et al., 1992). From the proposed Malmquist index by Färe et al. (1992), we do not need the price information of inputs, intermediates, and outputs and are able to measure the change in both technical efficiencies and production technologies over different times (See Khezrimotlagh and Chen, 2018, pp. 303, for more detail).====It is worth mentioning that in the DEA literature, there are only two studies that examine the relationship between airlines’ efficiency and mergers (Choi, 2017; Merkert and Morrell, 2012). These two studies introduce an airline as one system including inputs-outputs which are different from our approach to introduce an airline as a 2SN system including inputs-intermediates-outputs. In this study, we compare our outcomes with the findings from the two mentioned studies and investigate whether assuming an airline as a two-stage network system influences the conclusions.====The key contributions of the paper to the literature are as follows: firstly, a VRS NDEA to estimate the Malmquist index is developed. Secondly, the contribution of each stage efficiency to the overall efficiency is studied, changes of these efficiency scores pre-and post-merger are investigated, and low-cost U.S. airline mergers are distinguished from network airline mergers. Thirdly, the productivity change for each individual merged airline pre-and post-merger are examined, and the contribution of production and technical change are assessed. Fourthly, we use more recent data by covering four U.S. airlines’ mergers (Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines; Continental Airlines and United Airlines; AirTran Airlines and Southwest Airways; American Airlines and US Airways).====The rest of this study is structured as follows.

However, such massive infrastructure projects become controversial, as the media has often framed infrastructure discourse into a conflict between environmental preservation and economic development. This paper explores the media portrayal of a proposal to develop an airport in the Ogasawara Islands, a remote Japanese region inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 2011. A thematic analysis was used to determine common themes found in 76 articles on the topic written between 2011 and 2019. These themes were then compared to an analysis of an island-wide census of residents, which collected opinions on the proposed airport and a follow-up interview conducted by the authors. The results reveal that the media had simplified and even misrepresented local opinion on the airport development as either pro-airport or pro-environment. Local islanders possessed complex opinions on the subject matter, and themes were identified beyond the typical economic development versus environment protection binary discourse associated with media coverage on infrastructure projects. Based on data collected from local interviews, this paper concludes with alternative scenarios to address local concerns.","For many small island communities, the lack of natural resources, small population, fragile ecosystems, and geographical remoteness from major market centers can limit economic development (Abeyratne, 1999; Yamamoto and Esteban, 2014). Due to limited resources and production capabilities, their ability to export primary products is generally low while relying heavily on importing capital and consumer goods (Kakazu, 2012). Consequently, tourism development has become an attractive and, sometimes, inevitable industry, as economic diversification remains limited (Rao, 2002). Island communities have used their intrinsic natural and cultural attractions to stimulate the local economy through direct foreign investment (Ramkissoon, 2015). Air transportation has transformed many islands into potential tourism destinations, as tourists have become interested in traveling to what they perceive as exotic, newly accessible locations (Sharpley, 2012). As a result, tourism has become inextricably linked with air transportation. Without establishing transportation routes between them and their markets, many islands would not have been accessible to visitors (Lohmann and Nguyen, 2011).====Japan has utilized tourism as a development tool to hasten economic development, such as in the case of Okinawa Prefecture, an archipelago in southern Japan, where development plans since the 1970s have urged the construction of multiple airports to stimulate the tourism economy through improved accessibility (Nguyen, 2017). In this way, Okinawa was modeled after Hawaii, mimicking its transformation from an agricultural economy centered on plantations into a coastal resort destination by matching the investments made into similar infrastructures in the U.S. archipelago (Tada, 2015). Similarly, proposals are being made to develop an airport in the Ogasawara Islands to take advantage of its recent inscription into the World Heritage List, hoping to further develop its economy through tourism and strengthen other related services.====Major infrastructure development, such as airports, often require significant financial, time and resource investment and the involvement of a large number of stakeholders. Due to the wide-ranging social, economic, and environmental impacts of such infrastructure development, intense debates may ensue as community members and other stakeholders present their stances (London et al., 2021). The media plays a significant role in both capturing these debates and potentially influencing the discourses that come out of them (London et al., 2017). In the case of Ogasawara, a proposal to build an airport on a small island not only involves the interest of politicians and investors, but also impacts its community, particularly in terms of the environment and economy.====This research examines media coverage of the proposal to develop an airport in Ogasawara Island and the degree to which it represents the opinions of the local community. To identify the themes emanating from the media coverage, this research explores how the media frames Ogasawara's airport development discourse and identifies significant themes produced from news articles. A thematic analysis was conducted on local opinions, which were extracted from a local government census and onsite interviews. Utilizing a thematic analysis of media, the authors compare and contrast the themes from news articles with local opinions, provided by a local government census and interviews conducted throughout the present research.====Through this comparison, this paper seeks to answer the following research questions:====Finally, as major infrastructure projects often generate complex opinions, by utilizing information acquired from interviews, this paper briefly explores alternative scenarios that could potentially address the multiple and complex concerns residents have surrounding the airport development.",Airport infrastructure development in Ogasawara Islands Japan: A comparison of media and public discourse analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000412,29 April 2022,2022,Research Article,122.0

Our results show that service frequency is an essential factor for travelers choosing a mode of transportation between Dallas and Houston. A potential competition and cooperation opportunity exist between airlines and HSR on this corridor.","High-speed rails (HSR) have received increasing global recognition in recent years in Europe and Asia. High-speed intercity movement has been dramatically enhanced by reducing travel time and improving onboard convenience (Chen and Haynes, 2017). However, HSR development is not very advanced in the United States; a completed HSR network still does not exist in this country, although California and Texas are working on developing HSR networks. An HSR project that connects Dallas and Houston (240 mi) is the focus of this research. This line is expected to offer service between these two cities in less than 90 min and at speeds up to 200 mph, with one stop in the Brazos Valley. Texas Central, an investor-owned company behind the Texas HSR, has planned to start HSR operation by 2026.====Substantial HSR-related research is largely based on European and Asian contexts; research in the United States context is rare. The extant literature indicates that route-specific characteristics considerably influence findings (Doomernik, 2016; Givoni and Dobruszkes, 2013). Given this, and the spatial development of rural and urban economic activities and infrastructure are different in the United States compared to Asia and Europe, we can observe a lack of understanding of how travelers choose between HSR and airlines in the United States, including Texas. Such a lack of understanding is critical considering that Dallas is home to one of the first low-cost carriers (LCC), Southwest Airlines (SWA), who connects point-to-point networks instead of using a hub-and-spoke network (Doomernik, 2016).====The current study addresses this problem by empirically investigating the attributes that would influence travelers' choice of transport mode from Dallas to Houston. It aims to measure the impact of HSR on airlines by considering the degree of interchangeability between the two transport modes. Specifically, we ask what attributes (e.g., traveling time, frequency, price) would influence travelers' choice between HSR or air. Further questions investigated include: How would demographic characteristics influence the travelers' choice? What are other factors that would play a role in the travelers’ choice? How would the introduction of HSR influence the aviation market on this route? To answer these questions, we carried out a stated preference (SP) survey and used a discrete choice model to investigate the choice travelers would make between air and HSR, as well as the potential effects of HSR entry on airlines.====Our results show that frequency is the major attribute that influences travelers’ choices. Moreover, we found that males and older people have a higher tendency to choose HSR. The survey including variables such as safety, comfort, on-time arrival and departure, parking, security control, and connection, and this allowed us to observe that safety and on-time service influence the choice of transportation mode on this route.====This study offers three main contributions to existing literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to provide an understanding of the important attributes (i.e., traveling time, price, frequency) travelers consider when choosing between HSR or air in the United States. Second, we develop an understanding of how demographic factors and the importance of safety and on-time service influence travelers’ choice of HSR or air between Houston and Dallas. Third, our findings provide an insight into the dynamics (i.e., competition and possible cooperation) between HSR and an LCC (Southwest Airlines) in the U.S. context.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the relevant literature. Next, we present the methodology and data analysis in Section 3. Section 4 presents the results and implementation.

This study also highlights that estimating the same coefficients for the explanatory variables causes bias when the departure and arrival cities have different effects on the dependent variable. The results reveal that variables such as GDP per capita, population, and distance have positive and statistically significant effects on the amount of air cargo carried. It is concluded that while the GDP per capita of the departure city has a greater impact on the amount of air cargo between the two cities compared to the GDP per capita of the arrival city; the population of the arrival city affects the amount of air cargo to a greater extent in comparison to the population of departure city.","In 2019, right before the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be observed, the air cargo industry had reached a record high value of Cargo Tonne-Kilometers (CTK); however, the recent disruptions affecting the global supply chain has a fluctuating effect on the production and trade operations, which are the biggest driving forces behind the air cargo industry (IATA, 2021a). Furthermore, world-renowned airports such as New York's JFK, Los Angeles International Airport, and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport have experienced longer transportation durations due to factors such as inadequate capacity and the quarantine period of their staff (IATA, 2021b). Regardless of the problems encountered in the air cargo industry, companies still prefer air transportation to supply the markets due to various issues that may be encountered in other modes of transportation, such as the interruption of the container flow in the maritime transport which creates container shortages in ports and causes increased transportation durations and costs. As a result of the extended transportation durations of other modes of transportation in the market and the nondeferrable supply demands of companies, the air cargo industry has produced similar levels of cargo traffic compared to the period before the pandemic crisis and in 2021, the amount of air cargo carried came close to the all-time high (IATA, 2021a). Moreover, Boeing (2020) estimates that the market will grow by 4% annually until 2039 and it is expected that Revenue Tonne-Kilometers (RTK) of the air cargo market will at the least be doubled by 2039.====The Turkish air cargo market is among the most important markets that contribute to the amount of cargo carried around the world. In terms of global cargo traffic, Turkey's flag carrier Turkish Airlines was in eighth place with 6,977 million Tonne-Kilometers of cargo traffic in 2020 (IATA, 2021c). In recent years, the Turkish government and air cargo stakeholders from Turkey have accelerated their investments in the air cargo industry to increase their global share within the air cargo industry. For example, İstanbul Airport, which has started to operate in 2018, plans to have an annual cargo handling capacity of 5.5 million tonnes when all of its construction phases are completed, and it is expected that when the full capacity is reached, the airport will become an important hub for the global air cargo traffic (IGA, 2021). The country's air cargo industry statistics also show the return on these investments as the amount of cargo carried by airlines in the Turkish market has increased by an annual average of 9.9% in the last 10 years (DHMI, 2020a). When one analyzes the statistics of the domestic and international routes, international air cargo traffic shows a similar performance to the aggregated air cargo traffic data; on the other hand, domestic air cargo traffic has remained stagnant for the last decade, although international air cargo traffic statistics are influential in the acceleration of investments in the domestic air cargo market.====In the domestic air cargo market of Turkey, for the last couple of decades, the demand for belly cargo capacity has been supplied continuously by Turkish Airlines and Pegasus Airlines, and as of 2021, İzmir-based Air Anka Airlines has joined among them as another supplier. In addition, Turkish Cargo, which is a subsidiary of Turkish Airlines, will continue its activities as a company that only carries out cargo operations from 2021 onwards. As a result of these developments, the General Directorate of State Airports Authority (DHMI) estimates the total annual amount of cargo to be carried within Turkey's domestic routes as 59.7 thousand tonnes for 2021, 74.2 thousand tonnes for 2022, and 84.6 thousand tonnes for 2023 (DHMI, 2020a).====Although the potential growth of Turkey's domestic air cargo market and the positive expectations for the future have increased the investments of the stakeholders, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study among the scholarship that attempts to determine the factors that affect the amount of cargo carried on Turkish domestic routes. This study first aims to fill this gap by determining the factors that affect the amount of cargo carried between airport pairs in Turkey's domestic routes. Moreover, the following section shows that over the last two decades, the gravity model is one of the most prominent methods used to estimate the number of passengers and the amount of cargo in the aviation field. However, researchers utilize different estimation methods on gravity models, such as OLS or PPML, which use different data sets that either exclude or include the zero observations. The second contribution of this study is to comparatively apply these different approaches in the literature to Turkish domestic air cargo data. As a result, this study not only reports which variables have more effect on air cargo traffic between city pairs in comparison to other variables used in the model, but it also sets forth which methods are more appropriate for the gravity model estimation following the data set and the purpose of the study.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The second section provides a literature survey on the prediction of airlines' traffic volume and briefly examines the studies on the air cargo industry of Turkey while touching upon the present state of the industry. Section 3 gives a brief explanation of the PPML and OLS methods along with the basic gravity model and summarizes the data set and models; section 4 reports the empirical findings; section 5 discusses the study's findings on the characteristics of the Turkish air cargo market, and last sections provide conclusions and further suggestions.",Analyzing air cargo flows of Turkish domestic routes: A comparative analysis of gravity models,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000382,26 April 2022,2022,Research Article,124.0

In addition, the relationship between the airlines’ CSR attributes and the above post-behavioral intentions was examined. Southwest Airlines was selected as the study subject because it has a high market share in the U.S. low-cost airline market. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to recruit the survey participants, and 424 valid observations were ultimately used for data analysis. The results demonstrated that service experience positively affects both brand love and reuse intention. Furthermore, environmental CSR positively impacts brand love for Southwest Airlines. Finally, brand love is positively associated with reuse intention. These results could provide meaningful implications for LCC management.","Due to the increasing market share of low-cost carriers (LCC) (which is expected to further increase by 21% by 2034) and the ease of starting a LCC business compared to starting a full-service carrier (FSC) business, the market competitiveness of the LCC market continues to increase (US Airline Market Share, 2020; Kim and Kim, 2018). To secure the market competitiveness of LCC companies, the quality of service provided by LCCs has become an increasingly important factor (Seo et al., 2015; US Airline Market Share, 2020; Kim and Kim, 2018). That is, the traditional competitiveness of LCCs has been represented by their affordable pricing, but as the importance of the services they provide has since grown, the quality of the service management provided has become a key element for a LCC to be competitive (O'Connell and Williams, 2005; de Wit and Zuidberg, 2012; Seo et al., 2015; Gross and Lück, 2016). While the quality of service of LCCs has recently been attracting increasing attention, most prior studies on the quality of carrier service have been conducted on full-service airline customers (Ahn and Lee, 2011; Wu and Cheng, 2013; Kim and Park, 2016; Haghighat, 2017; Han et al., 2019; Han et al., 2019a, Han et al., 2019b, Han et al., 2019c; Han et al., 2020; Kim and Kim, 2018). In other words, there has been a relative lack of research examining LCC service quality; therefore, there is a need for systematic research on the quality of service of LCCs. Thus, one of the objectives of this study is to elucidate the structural relationship between customers' service experience in LCCs and post-psychological variables such as brand love and reuse intention.====Numerous studies have indicated that the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an effective corporate strategy in business-related research due to the increasing influence of stakeholders, but in the domain of LCC, CSR is considered as an unnecessary corporate strategy on the grounds that corporations should raise prices to offset the cost of CSR (Freeman and Liedtka, 1991; Seo et al., 2015). However, as interest in value consumption grows recently, consumers' interest in corporates' social contributions has also grown (Painter-Morland, 2006; Demacarty, 2009; Nwagbara and Reid, 2013; Alhaddi, 2015). Accordingly, some LCC companies are already actively implementing CSR strategies to improve the relationship with stakeholders or to increase their corporates' images (Southwest, 2020), but empirical studies verifying the effectiveness of LCC companies' CSR are relatively insufficient. Therefore, another axis of current study is to verify the effectiveness of LCC companies’ CSR strategies.====The concept of brand love and reuse intention was used in this study to identify the potential roles of quality of service and CSR for LCC customers. Brand love refers to affective responses such as affection for a particular brand (Chaudhuri and Holbrook, 2001; Carroll and Ahuvia, 2006; Unal and Aydın, 2013), and airline businesses typically use brands to communicate and distinguish their services and business models (Shaw, 2012; Bachwich and Wittman, 2017). For this reason, multiple LCC businesses take care of their brands by paying attention to customers’ needs (e.g., Southwest, JetBlue, Allegiant Air, Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines) (Shaw, 2012; Bachwich and Wittman, 2017; US Airline Market Share, 2020). Moreover, given that reuse intention is directly related to business sales growth as a form of customer loyalty, scholars have often adopted reuse intention as a representative outcome variable (Kettinger and Smith, 2009; Tseng, 2013; Choi and Sun, 2016; Rosell and Allen, 2020). Thus, brand love and reuse intention will be employed as the result variables of service experience and CSR.====Scholars have alluded that triple bottom line theory (TBL) is one of the widely used theoretical foundations of CSR (Norman and MacDonald, 2004; Alhaddi, 2015; Lock and Araujo, 2020). Considering the need to verify the effectiveness of CSR in LCC and representative theory of CSR, the theoretical framework of TBL was used to illustrate the role of CSR in brand love and reuse intention in this study. Also, TBL has been utilized in numerous empirical CSR studies including the area of airline research, and these studies have empirically demonstrated its explanatory power (Park et al., 2015; Yadav and Dhingra, 2018). As a research subject, Southwest Airlines was selected to demonstrate the structural relationships between service experience, CSR, brand love, and reuse intention. This is because it possesses the largest market share (16.9 percent in 2019) among LCCs in the U.S. and ranks first in brand value (US airline market share in 2020).","The structural relationship between a low-cost carrier’s service experience, corporate social responsibility, brand love, and reuse intention: The case of Southwest Airlines",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000370,17 April 2022,2022,Research Article,125.0

Our ==== solution deploys joint profits by minimizing the ==== to form sub-groups, thus ensuring the alliance's stability. The ==== is reasonable in a network collaboration where the preservation of the network itself is essential. By application to a numerical example of an airline joint venture, we examine the validity of the proposed distribution rule in the cooperation-allocation problem. The collective surplus of logistics collaboration is suggested by a mixed-integer programming model to solve the optimal value of combinations of the multi-commodity flow problem under the network shared. In addition, the results are interpreted by comparison with other solutions in cooperation ====, such as the Shapley value, the τ–value, and the nucleolus. We offer further insights into changes in profit-sharing using a sensitivity analysis considering efficiency abatement.","Intense competition due to the advent of low-cost carriers and increased consumer power has forced airlines to improve competitiveness by cooperating with their competitors. Given the difficulty of entering new markets due to regulations or industry characteristics, alliances have become a popular alternative for traditional airlines. Joint ventures (JVs), the most intensive partnership in the airline industry, have risen in prominence over the last few decades. In fact, JVs accounted for 25% of global long-haul traffic in 2016, compared to 5% in 2006, are expected to increase to over one-third of global passenger traffic by 2021 (Lewis et al., 2017), and even are going to replace airline alliances (Harteveldt, 2016). The JV is an agreement between two or more different airlines, aiming to boost business in an enlarged market by operating like one entity on pre-assigned routes. This cooperation model is theoretically possible without direct equity investment, at least, since the airline industry has a property of metal neutrality, which means no matter who is operating the actual flying. Thus, JV is regarded as a virtual merger. Carriers can sell the tie-up network tickets and use a partner airline's facilities without restraint under the extended collaborative structure. Moreover, JV partners pool their revenues and share their costs. The recent JV between Korean Air and Delta Airlines is pursuing this rule. However, this profit-sharing approach is not common because of cost-related information, which is essential to allocate the profit, is considered a firm's secret. This is why the most former and current JVs in transatlantic areas are limited to dividing the revenue only.====Airline JV is a horizontal form of inter-enterprise collaboration that generates additional revenue based on integrated and expanded networks. Considerable studies have explored topics related to forming and managing inter-firm cooperation or so-called strategic alliances. There are relevant examples such as consortium for technology development or logistics collaboration in trucking. Airline JVs offer airlines an advantageous environment from the market enlarged, and passengers also benefit from airline alliances' tight collaboration. For example, travelers gain access to an increased number of flights, more diverse schedules or better connections under JVs. In contrast, horizontal cooperation is regulated by antitrust laws because it hurts the market balance due to the rise in the alliance's power in the market. Airline JVs can be carried out only when each country's governments approve the plan through rigorous screening, including judging that the welfare benefits of their citizens will increase. Nevertheless, JV's acceptance seems to have become a bit lenient recently as it has been recognized to contribute to consumers' convenience.====Apart from the influence on society, airlines’ purpose is to generate mutual benefit through cooperation and ultimately aim to create their own profit. Therefore, they are interested in sharing the joint outcome properly among members. Although substantial research has explored topics related to forming and managing inter-firm cooperation, relatively little research has focused on how best to distribute the joint profits among affiliated members. Particularly, there is a lack of existing research to suggest more appropriate ways of allocating profits in a specific industry. This paper deals with profit-sharing, focusing on the shared network such as logistics collaboration. It is well acknowledged that potential partners are motivated to form or join an alliance by rules that equitable distribution is guaranteed. In addition, ensuring the fairness of allocations allows the alliance to sustain and gain collective benefits continuously as a consequence. Thus, such a sustainable relationship can be a specific goal of logistics collaboration since the network itself is an asset of alliances through network sharing. In this vein, developing a reasonable allocation method acceptable to all related parties is critical and deserves further investigation. We aim to show that a specific sharing rule guarantees a coalition achieving extra profits by retaining the partnership. The airline JV is a suitable testbed that demonstrates the cooperation-allocation issue more widely because these benefit-sharing schemes depend on profit, covering costs and revenues.====Answering questions about what is reasonable when dividing profits, cooperative game theory offers a particularly helpful venue to provide useful solution concepts. In our application into an airline joint venture, we present a new profit-sharing method aimed at maintaining the entire network and compare it to three existing solutions. The analysis consists of two parts: (1) figuring out collective values from a network collaboration and (2) calculating each party's contribution. In detail, the optimization model is set up to find the alliance's value created, which is theoretically seen as a maximum value achievable through cooperation. Then, the collective benefits are distributed among participants in a proposed profit-sharing scheme. This paper is worth providing a practical alternative to various network-sharing entities.====The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows: we review related literature in section 2. Section 3 designs a cooperative game of network collaboration and presents a new profit-sharing. In section 4, we first analyse the cooperative benefits by deriving our optimization model and determining the maximized total profit with a numerical example. We then compare it to the different existing cooperative game-theoretic solution concepts. Sensitivity analysis follows to examine the impact of efficiency. Finally, section 5 offers concluding remarks.

Market entry, in general, is a highly explored empirical theme in many areas such as economics, management, and marketing literature (Dixit and Chintagunta, 2007), the reason being that it not only spurs competition but may induce innovation (Hüschelrath and Müller, 2013). Not surprisingly, one of the crucial elements of both incumbent and newcomer airlines’ strategic planning that can be impacted by the competitive dynamics that follow market entry is their business model as transformations and adaptations to newly established market environments may emerge.====This study considers the case of Azul Airlines in the Brazilian air transport industry. Azul Airlines was established in 2008 by David Neeleman, founder of JetBlue, one of the largest low-cost carriers (LCCs) in the US market, and certainly a good reference for the newcomer's startup period. From serving only three destinations in December 2008, Azul has become the third largest airline in Brazil, and now serves more domestic destinations than any other carrier since the new millennium.==== Not even the giant legacy carrier Varig and its group of regional carriers in the early 2000s had a network that reached the mark of 110 served destinations with scheduled flights in Brazil.====Azul typically explores short- and medium-haul markets from smaller airports, a characteristic that, in principle, reminds us of Southwest Airlines (Boguslaski et al., 2004). It also operates the only major secondary airport in the country, São Paulo/Campinas (VCP). However, contrary to the notable US LCC, Azul is far from maintaining a standardized fleet, and since its launch has entered a diversified portfolio of low-, medium-, and high-density routes. So far, the only constraint to the carrier's expansion has probably been the lack of availability of departure and landing slots at São Paulo/Congonhas Airport (CGH), a key airport in Brazil.====One motivation for studying the case of Azul Airlines is to investigate its change in its business model across the years and how these changes may have affected its network and route entry decisions. A major landmark in Azul's journey was its merger with Trip Airlines in May 2012, when it was just three years old. On the one hand, it still resembled a low-cost carrier, with a clear penetration pricing strategy to quickly promote traffic growth and consumer awareness in more densely populated markets such as São Paulo, Porto Alegre, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte metropolitan regions. Trip, on the other hand, was the largest regional carrier in Latin America with an extensive network coverage across the country.====In this study, we developed an econometric model of network construction for Azul Airlines in the Brazilian airline industry. Our aim was to identify the effects of the 2012 merger and how this event affected the carrier's route entries. So far, the literature has not discussed the possible effects of a merger on an airline's entry decision and how it might affect its network planning. This study fills this gap by investigating how the merger with Trip impacted Azul's entry decision in the post-merger period. We employed a discrete-choice framework of entry decisions, applying the simple probit, random-effects probit, and rare event logistic regression models to a data set that comprised more than one million observations from thousands of domestic airport pairs across the 2008–2018 period.====We contrasted the estimated entry determinants before and after the merger with the benchmarks of JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines obtained from the literature, namely Boguslaski et al. (2004), and Müller et al. (2012), hereafter BIL04 and MHB12, respectively. Additionally, we propose a methodology for comparing different airline entry patterns by utilizing the Kappa statistic for inter-rater agreement (Cohen, 1960).====The next sections of this research are divided as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review on entry in airline markets, and the studies that covered the empirical issue of airline entry patterns. Section 3 presents the research design, with a description of the application, the data, the econometric model, and the estimation strategy.

The climate impact of scheduled air travel to and from this airport within a specified year is thus given a price tag that considers greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide. It is argued that the airport's climate costs are low compared to its economic benefits.","Greenhouse gases (GHGs) cause global warming and climate change (IPCC et al., 2014). Aviation contributes significantly to anthropogenic emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as the formation of contrails and cirrus. Despite the phenomenon of flight shaming especially in Europe and the Covid-19 pandemic, it is likely that global air transport demand will continue to grow until 2050 (Gössling et al., 2021). Thus, aviation is a key target of climate change mitigation efforts (Fichert et al., 2020). The industry is also affected by climate change itself and has to adapt to the consequences (Ryley et al., 2020). Airports in particular can be increasingly exposed to climate change, for example due to rising sea levels, higher temperatures and greater weather extremes (Dolman and Vorage, 2020). In this broad context, we examine the climate footprint of air travel that can be allocated to the operation of a single airport. This represents a different perspective compared to an analysis geared towards airlines, flights or passengers. The annual climate impact of an airport is assessed in monetary terms as external costs instead of staying with the amount of GHG emissions. In particular, we determine potential savings in climate costs assuming that all scheduled air services at a given airport are discontinued without replacement. This airport-centric climate cost analysis also complements research of Hepting et al. (2020) who analyzed global climate change caused by flights departing from a particular country.====Becken and Shuker (2019) approximate aviation emissions caused by travel destinations (regions or countries) via the airports serving them. Their demand-side approach to aviation emissions considers origin and destination (O&D) city pairs related to passenger travel plans or airline markets. In contrast, we examine flight legs, i.e., nonstop operations between a departure airport and the next arrival airport. While a leg stops when the aircraft lands, O&D pairs may involve connecting flights via an intermediate airport other than the departure airport or the arrival airport of the passenger's itinerary. We do not consider GHG emissions caused by the existence of other airports that provide the necessary infrastructure and services for connecting flights, especially long-haul flights, when calculating the annual climate costs of an individual airport. The inclusion of both airports for outbound travel, i.e., the departure and the connecting airport, leads to double counting of negative climate effects. Same holds with regard to inbound travel for the connecting and the arrival airport.====We assess an airport's climate impact as external costs rather than remaining with amounts of GHG emissions. Once the climate damage is given a price tag, it can be compared to other economic effects of air travel. This gives national and international policies to reduce the climate footprint of aviation an additional point of reference. The review of national and international climate policies by Larsson et al. (2019) suggests that current policy instruments such as a quota obligation for biofuels (Wise et al., 2017) or air passenger taxes (Denstadli and Veisten, 2020) are primarily aimed at influencing airlines or passengers rather than airports. Similarly, carbon trading schemes for aviation such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) oblige airlines to offset their carbon emissions (Scheelhaase et al., 2018).====More specifically, climate costs of an airport can become an essential part of a comprehensive cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) of an airport. Similar to other studies commissioned by airport companies and trade associations, Intervistas (2015) emphasizes the important role of airports for the economic welfare of its surrounding regions while largely ignoring negative environmental effects. This limited view at airports is unlikely to be maintained with an increasing climate protection movement (Mkono et al., 2020). Measuring emissions in monetary terms enables a comparison with other economic effects of airport infrastructure and investments. According to Vickerman (2017), a CBA is limited to those impacts that can be expressed in monetary terms, if not in an actual market, at least in a surrogate market. However, the environmental effects mentioned by Vickerman include costs of accidents, noise pollution and visual intrusion, but not global warming and climate change. This implies a focus on the local emissions of an airport without considering its global environmental impact.====Various calculators to estimate the climate impact of air travel exist that originally primarily aimed at carbon emissions (Miyoshi and Mason, 2009). In principle, the method proposed here works with every calculator as long as emissions are linkable to individual air travel. We use the flight emissions calculator of Atmosfair (2016), a German non-governmental organization operating a well-established carbon offset scheme, which considers GHG emissions beyond carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It also allows for a cost minimum per passenger as a lump sum penalty not directly related to the amount of emitted pollutants when flying ultra-short-haul distances up to approximately 600 km. Hence, the resulting average costs of GHG emissions per passenger on the scheduled services operating at an examined airport are relatively high. While the Atmosfair calculator can determine the climate impact of a specific flight, only the average value on a particular route is used here. A detailed analysis is more important, for example, if the task is to influence customer to choose less polluting airlines or flights (Baumeister, 2017). Debbage and Debbage (2019) found that nonstop routes reduce carbon emissions by roughly 100 kg/person relative to the next best connecting option. Detours may at least partially be compensated for by hub efficiencies, for example, through larger aircraft and higher passenger load factors (Loo et al., 2014). However, the carbon impact of different routings is irrelevant here, because the focus is on a single airport and, therefore, only flight legs between this airport and the respective next departure or arrival airport are taken into account.====A comprehensive description of the environmental impacts of airports can be found in Graham (2018). There are different sources of emissions at an airport beyond aircraft-related operations, for example ground transport of passengers to and from an airport (Postorino and Mantecchini, 2014). Such non-aircraft related emissions are not considered in the present study. Hu et al. (2020) investigated carbon emissions as local airports emissions, especially with regard to the landing and take-off (LTO) cycle. The LTO emissions of a given flight only represent a percentage of its total emissions. What is more, the multiplier effect of emitting pollutants when flying at high altitudes is not covered. Dalla Chiara et al. (2017) analyzed the relative energy efficiency of high-speed rail as a substitute for short-haul flights. More recently, Baumeister and Leung (2021) discussed the feasibility of replacing short-haul flights with non-high-speed rail. In contrast, we focus on the potential climate cost savings if all scheduled air services at an airport were to be discontinued without shifting traffic to other airports or using other modes of transport.====The reminder of the paper is set out as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology.

This study employs IATA MarketIS data to examine the ","Along with globalization and the flourishing tourism industry, global tourists traveling via air transportation have presented stable growth, and total travel distances significantly increased in a short period. Airlines strove to provide passengers a more convenient and comfortable journey by connecting to more airports with ==== equipment and human resources. Consequently, most airlines selected to participate in a global airline alliance (GAA). This decision avoided a massive capital investment for new planes, large-scope service networks, and high labor costs.====GAAs represent a kind of strategic alliances with a set and novel brand that includes two or more parties. For years, the airline industry has gradually narrowed down to three main GAAs: The Star Alliance, SkyTeam, and the Oneworld Alliance, altogether they represented two-thirds of international traffic in 2018. Table 1 shows that the share of the Star Alliance was 21.9% in revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) and counted 26 members, including nine Asia-based airlines. The SkyTeam, consisting of 20 member airlines, held 18.8% of total scheduled traffic in RPKs. The Oneworld Alliance handled 15.4% of passengers worldwide with 13 members, including six Asia-based airlines. The service of these three alliances covered over 170 countries and 1,100 airports. Each one had over 14,000 departures a day and operated over 3,000 airplanes.====The most significant benefit to member airlines within a GAA is sharing a service network with the others, usually at airport connections. An airport can be a gateway for a country or even a continent and a hub where passengers transfer to other countries. The flights operated by these alliances can provide a whole picture of their supply deployment but without passenger impact. In particular, one of the reasons that airlines join GAAs is to assist passengers that require transfers. Hence, the comprehensive analysis for the traffic at airports can present the actual effects of the cooperation and competition (known as coopetition) within and among GAAs. Such realities can be further explored to understand whether the airlines based at the studied airports (called airport-based airlines) have ==== (HGA) on market shares and cooperation niches intuitively because of intensive flights and better time slots. Meanwhile, the depth of airline cooperation can be found in their links with other members within the same GAA and the other GAAs.====This study aims to explore the traffic handle status and market share for the current global largest airline alliances at Asian airports. The analysis can compare three GAAs' collaboration and competition effects, including international round-trip and transfer markets. The HGAs of airport-based airlines should develop some superiority for the attributed GAAs and affect the different characteristics of each airport. This study attempted to implement coopetition analysis to cluster the studied airports.====Previous studies had plenty of contributions to the coexisting cooperation and competition influence for airline-to-airline code-sharing flights, such as parallel (Wan et al., 2009) and complementary (Zou et al., 2011) route structures, and other alliance topics reviewed in the next section. However, research regarding a large-scale report to reflect the coopetition effects among GAAs from the airport perspective is relatively limited, particularly for passengers' actual origins and destinations and their transfer travel selections. Although such tasks require immense data support and analysis, this study can fill these academic gaps. From the practical points, the involved airlines in this study can realize their self-own advantages at their bases because of GAAs and enforce the cooperation with their partners to elaborate the alliance benefits at other airports. The analysis results can also be a valuable reference for airport authorities or management companies to consider their policies or incentives on network linkage development based on GAAs.====A reliable and detailed data source is an indispensable element in this analysis. This study subscribed to yearly data in 2018 from the IATA MarketIS database for ten selected Asian airports as case studies. They include Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (IATA code: TPE), Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (IATA code: CAN), Hong Kong International Airport (IATA code: HKG), Incheon International Airport of Seoul (IATA code: ICN), Kuala Lumpur International Airport (IATA code: KUL), Narita International Airport of Tokyo (IATA code: NRT), Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA code: PEK), Shanghai Pudong International Airport (IATA code: PVG), Tan Son Nhat International Airport at Ho Chi Minh City (IATA code: SGN), and Singapore Changi Airport (IATA code: SIN). These airports are all vital airports on the western Pacific Rim. Many famous and large-scale airlines consider these airports primary gateways and transfer airports in East Asia, with intensive flights penetrating Asian markets. Fig. 1 shows these airports and based airlines with participated GAAs. Seven airlines belonged to the Star Alliance, six belonged to the SkyTeam, and three belonged to the Oneworld Alliance.====From the perspective of airports rather than airline routes, this study explored the internal and external cooperation and competition among GAAs for the international round-trip markets of the discussed airports. This analysis can be considered as parallel competition on specific airports. Further, this study also dealt with the transfer connection of passengers between GAAs at the discussed airports. This analysis can be figured out as complementary coopetition on the selected airports. Qualitative analysis with defined indexes based on market shares can express the results of coopetition status for each GAA at selected airports. The main findings from these analyses include that most airports had higher internal cooperation on transfer markets among GAAs. Skyteam and Oneworld Alliance appeared higher internal competition on round-trip markets at a few airports. Star Alliance and SkyTeam also produced relatively more significant external competition on transfer traffic at a few airports. Such results stemmed from home-ground advantages of airport-based airlines for their attributed GAAs.",Coopetition effects among global airline alliances for selected Asian airports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972200014X,1 March 2022,2022,Research Article,129.0

The methodology is validated against the information provided by passenger surveys at the Madrid-Barajas Airport. The research shows the potential of anonymized mobile phone records to complement and enrich the information provided by passenger surveys regarding airport catchment areas, ==== and passenger behavior. This methodology is then applied to the study of air travel demand in Madrid-Barajas Airport in July 2020, two weeks after the COVID-19 lockdown period in Spain. Finally, we discuss how the information extracted from the fusion of mobile phone records and passenger surveys can be leveraged for the modelling and evaluation of novel intermodal solutions.","The European high-level vision on transport depicts a passenger-centric system that takes travelers from their origin to their destination in a seamless, efficient, predictable, environmentally-friendly and resilient manner (European Commission. Whit, 2011). In line with this overarching goal, the report ‘Flightpath 2050 - Europe's Vision for Aviation’ calls for an air transport system thoroughly integrated with other transport modes (European Commission. Flig, 2011). The airport of the future is expected to become a multimodal hub that creates the conditions for travelers to reach their destination by the most efficient and sustainable combination of modes.====Achieving this vision requires enhanced modal integration not only in terms of physical infrastructure, but also of business models, operational processes and information systems. The development of a multimodal, passenger-centric air transport system can benefit from better situational awareness of the status of the airport processes, the ground transport system and the door-to-door passenger flows. In recent years, different studies have been carried out to explore how the digital traces generated by personal mobile devices, in particular mobile phone records, can be exploited to improve the understanding of passenger behavior, measure door-to-door travel times and characterize airport catchment areas ((García-Albertos et al., 2016), (García-Albertos et al., 2017)). These studies also identified a number of challenges that must be faced when using mobile phone records as a primary data source for airport demand assessment: (i) the analysis of international trips, given that mobile phone records datasets have usually a national spatial scope; (ii) the distinction between different airport users, namely arriving and departing passengers, transfer passengers, workers and short-term visitors; and (iii) the full characterization of passenger tours, including access and egress modes, stay durations and trip purposes.

Four centrality measurement indices (degree, closeness, eigenvector, and betweenness centrality) of the airports were used to assess the entire network and ranking of individual hub airports. The study data, provided by The Official Aviation Guide (OAG) from December 2019 to April 2020, indicated that during the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a decrease in passenger volume (60%–98.4%) as well as the number of flights (1.5%–82.6%). However, there were no such significant changes regarding the popularity ranking of most airports during the outbreak. Before this occurred (December 2019), most hub airports were in China (April 2020), and this trend remain similar during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the values of the centrality measurement decreased significantly for most hub airports due to travel restrictions issued by the government.","Airlines provide long-distance transportation between continents and have been a popular mode of transportation for decades. More than any other mode of transportation (ocean or ground), air transport has benefited from advanced technological innovations, which have had a revolutionary effect on long-distance travel. However, with these advancements have come to some challenges. For example, the risk of global pandemic transmission has increased in recent years (====) and Ebola in 2014. (====). In response authorities must enforce lockdown or travel restrictions to block the disease-spreading pathways; however, the impact and social cost of these policies must be evaluated.====Compared to previous pandemic outbreaks, COVID-19 has had a more devastating impact around the world. In the first few months of 2020, the disease spread rapidly to almost every country and led to extraordinary and previously inconceivable travel bans and lockdowns (====; ====; ====; ====). The reactions of countries to the emergence of COVID-19 were quite diverse. When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic in Mach 2020), most countries were placed under partial or even full mobility/flight restrictions, which limited international travel considerably (====). Although travel restrictions and flight cancellations slowed down the spread of COVID, they severely disrupted various aspects of the transportation system (====; ====; ====; ====).====COVID-19 has impacted air transportation in several important ways, such as reducing passenger volume (====), the number of flights (====; ====), and airport network connectivity (====). Due to the fact that many researchers (====; ====). Only a few studies (====; ====) have been able to illustrate the airline flow changes and detect airport network trends because, in part, they didn't check the airport popularity/ranking changes specifically. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 on passenger volume, the number of flights, and airport network connectivity.====In this study, two different approaches were used to identify the differences in airline O-D flow characteristics before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the fact that it is very difficult to identify changes in airline flow with illustrations using the entire dataset, a Clustering Large Application (CLARA) was implemented to group all airline O-D flow into several clusters based on their characteristics in both study periods. Our hypothesis states that some variables affect COVID-19's impact on O-D flow, such as distance, domestic/international flights, or if the origin or destination point is connected to China or not. The impact before and during the pandemic were evaluated based on passenger volume and the number of flights. In addition, four centrality measurements were used to analyze the pandemic changes in networks, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality. These indices can illustrate the importance of an airport. Then, a paired ====-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to determine the significance of the changes in the O-D flow and airport network before during, and during the pandemic.====This paper is organized as follows. Section ==== is a literature review on related topics and methodologies. Section ==== describes the data and research methodology utilized in our study. Section ==== provides an analysis of the results, and the conclusion is contained in Section ====.====Cluster 1: Short-distance domestic flights with no origins or destinations in China.====In cluster 1, all flow was in the form of short-distance domestic flights (1,100 km–1,500 km) occurring in Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, Russia, and Taiwan. In this cluster, there were 738 routes pre-COVID-19, which decreased by 1.5%–727 during the outbreak. As shown in ====, although some flights in the eastern part of Russia were eliminated, more new routes were introduced in the central and southern parts of Russia during the outbreak. Thus, COVID-19 has had an insignificant effect on the number of short-distance domestic flights. However, it has reduced the passenger volume to nearly 60% (from 8,130,211 to 3,255,994, ====).====Cluster 2: Medium-distance domestic flights with no origins or destinations in China.====In cluster 2, all airline flow was made up of medium-distance domestic flights (1,500 km–4,100 km) that departed from Russia and Japan. There were 115 routes before COVID-19 and 88 routes during the outbreak, a decrease of 23.5% (====). The most significant difference in airline flow before and during the outbreak was that some domestic routes in Russia were canceled (====). In addition, COVID-19 also reduced the passenger volume by approximately 60.2% (====).====Cluster 3: Long-distance domestic flights with no connection to China.====In cluster 3, all airline flow was made up of long-distance domestic flights in Russia. The number of routes was decreased by 20% from 10 to 8 during the outbreak. According to ====, only the longest route from Novosibirsk (OVB) to Pevek (PWE) in Russia was canceled. In addition, the total passenger volume decreased by 67.3% from 9,277 to 3,035 (====).====Cluster 4: Short-distance international flights with no origin or destination flights from or to China.====In cluster 4, all airline flow was short-distance international flights. The number of routes were decreased by approximately 46.1% from 152 to 82 during the outbreak. As seen in ====, routes to some airports in Japan were canceled. In addition, the total passenger volume decreased by nearly 93.1% from 2,313,504 to 160,189 (====). Therefore, COVID-19 reduced the number of flights and passengers in cluster 4.====Cluster 5: Medium-and long-distance international flights that have no connection with China.====In cluster 5, all flow consisted of medium-to long-distance international flights. The number of routes was decreased by approximately 57.1% from 140 to 60. As seen in ====, all long-distance flights arriving at Russian airports were canceled during the outbreak, which means there was a flight ban in particular airports in Russia. In addition, the total passenger volume decreased by roughly 96% from 1,776,739 to 71,370 (====).====Cluster 6: Short-distance international flights originating from China.====In cluster 6, all airline flow included short-distance international flights that departed only from China. Before COVID-19, this cluster had 51 routes that were limited to 16. ==== shows that all the flight routes from Wuhan Airport (WUH) were canceled and the flight routes from other airports such as Beijing (PEK), Shanghai (PVG), and Shenzhen (SZX) were severely limited during the outbreak. The total passenger volume also decreased by 97.3% from 656,467 to 17,567 (====).====Cluster 7: Medium-distance international flights originating from China.====In cluster 7, all airline flow consisted of medium-distance international flights all departing from China. The number of routes decreased by approximately 68.3% from 41 to 13 during the outbreak. As seen in ====, all medium-distance flights originating from Beijing (PEK), Shanghai (PVG), and Guangzhou (CAN) and going to Russian cities such as Krasnoyarsk (KJA), Yekaterinburg (SVX), Vladivostok (VVO), Irkutsk (IKT), Novosibirsk (OVB), and Irkutsk (IKT) were canceled, and flights from China to other airports such as Osaka (KIX), Okinawa (OKA), Sendai (SDJ), Busan (PUS), Jeju (CJU) and Kaohsiung (KHH) were greatly reduced in reaction to the spread of COVID-19. In addition, the total passenger volume decreased by approximately 98.4% from 466,780 to 7,387 (====).====Cluster 8: Short-distance international flights to China.====In cluster 8, all airline flow consisted of short-distance international flights departing from Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Macau, Hongkong, Taiwan, Mongolia as well as Russia to China only. Before COVID-19, this cluster had 235 routes which were drastically limited to 54 during COVID-19 struck. Routes decreased by approximately 77%. This huge difference in the number of routes can be seen in ====, which indicates that many routes from origin countries mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph were canceled during the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, there were fewer people taking international flights to China during COVID-19 began to spread. In addition, the total passenger volume decreased by nearly 97.5% from 1,435,411 to 36,213 (====).====Cluster 9: Medium-and long-distance international flights not originating from China but with China as a destination.====In cluster 9, the airline flow consisted of medium-and long-distance international flights (4,100–4,800 km) departing from several countries such as Japan, South Korea, Macau, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Russia. In this cluster, there were 190 international routes before the pandemic, which decreased to 33 during the outbreak. The number of routes were reduced by approximately 82.6% in this time period. ==== shows that most flights from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan were canceled during COVID-19 struck. Moreover, all flights originating from Russia were also canceled. This indicates that these countries implemented very restricted flight laws. Thus, the number of routes during COVID-19 began to spread was greatly reduced. Additionally, the total passenger volume drastically decreased by almost 97.5% from 820,983 to 20,273 during the outbreak (====).====Cluster 10: Short-distance domestic flights originating from and bound for China.====In cluster 10, all flow patterns were made up of short-distance domestic flights in China (====). The number of routes slightly decreased by14.2% from 473 to 406 before and during the outbreak, respectively. Thus, although COVID-19 had only a slight impact on domestic flight routes, it had a huge effect on the passenger volume which decreased by 75% from 5,736,121 to 1,637,755 (====).====Cluster 11: Medium-and long-distance domestic flights originating from and going to China.====In cluster 11, all flow patterns consisted of medium-distance domestic flights in China. There were 223 domestic routes before the outbreak; however, these numbers slightly decreased by nearly 14.8% to 190 routes during. Thus, as shown in ====, the impact of COVID-19 on these flights was also insignificant. However, the passenger volume decreased by nearly 75% from 3,049,326 to 762,235 (====).",The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on O-D flow and airport networks in the origin country and in Northeast Asia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000138,17 February 2022,2022,Research Article,131.0

Although the aviation market is a major entry point for viruses, little is known about how flight attendants view the risk of COVID-19 and whether they follow individual-organizational-governmental NPI protocols. Guided by protection motivation theory (Rogers, 1975), this study proposed an NPI model tailored specifically to the airline ==== and examined how an extended NPI would affect job satisfaction and ==== of Korean flight attendants (n = 371). Results revealed that perceptions of COVID-19 are positively related to three types of NPIs, which in turn positively influenced job satisfaction and customer orientation.

Research shows that COVID-19 can be transmitted by human-to-human respiratory droplets and from contaminated surfaces (====). Compared to seasonal influenza, it has a relatively high mortality rate among adults, and because the virus spreads quickly, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of June 2021, global deaths due to the virus had surpassed 3,500,000 with over 170,000,000 confirmed positive cases (====).====). A recent survey by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that more than half (55%) of respondents would not travel in 2020 due to the fear of COVID-19 (====). In April 2020, passenger numbers fell by more than 70% compared to the previous year (====). While the aviation market has continued to operate, it has done so at a significantly reduced rate. One underlying concern, beyond economics, is that flight attendants may be exposed to a high-level risk of infection (====). Following the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, ==== warned that the influenza virus can travel on aircraft as far as two rows ahead and two rows behind a contagious passenger. Not surprisingly, COVID-19 has infected hundreds of flight attendants since March 2020 (====).====), people will likely participate in self-protective behavior if they feel threatened. For this reason, we believe flight attendants who are afraid of or risk-averse to COVID-19 will likely participate in a recommended course of health preventive actions such as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) while working on aircraft.====Previous research has shown that in the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs, NPIs are the best hygiene strategy for reducing viral transmissions (====; ====; ====). Some research has investigated the impact of NPI on consumer behavior. For instance, ==== examined tourist behavior in terms of social NPI, whereas ==== explored tourist behavior in terms of individual NPI. However, additional NPI may be involved in the airline industry. That is, airline crew should abide by governmental and organizational (airlines) NPIs as well as individual NPI. Despite the importance of NPIs in the COVID-19 pandemic little research has explored the roles of different types of NPIs in previous research.====Thus, this study attempts to fill this research gap by exploring the roles of three types of NPIs (individual, organizational, and governmental). Specifically, this study examines how three types of NPIs play different roles in the relationship between perception of COVID-19 and job satisfaction, ultimately predicting ====. This study also examines whether protection motivation theory can be used to ground a theoretical model in the study of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study should contribute to the aviation literature by: (1) introducing three NPIs in the research framework using protection motivation theory (2) shedding light on these roles in the relationships between perception of COVID-19, job satisfaction, and customer orientation, and (3) contribute to airline management by providing safety protection strategies for airline crew through NPIs, that can improve job satisfaction and customer orientation.","Impact of perception of COVID-19 on NPI, job satisfaction, and customer orientation: Highlighting three types of NPIs for the airline industry",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000126,1 February 2022,2022,Research Article,132.0

We model a Bertrand duopoly sequential move game to analyze the impact of airlines' decisions on ticket fare and greening effort, as they contemplate upon the cost option of greening investment and ","Increased air travel in the past decade has correspondingly led to an increase in flight frequency, which in turn, has resulted in the emergence of two severe challenges in the aviation sector. They include congestion at airports, coupled with increased carbon emission (Brueckner and Zhang 2010; Madas and Zografos 2008). Congestion results in high waiting times for aircrafts and reduced on-time performance. For instance, in the past couple of years, North America and Asia experienced 30% increase in flight delays (Cornwall and Khan, 2019), which effectively translates to huge economic costs. The overall economic cost owing to congestion on the US economy alone, was estimated to be $31.2 billion in 2007 (Vaze and Barnhart, 2012). Thus, to reduce congestion and limit the increasing flight frequency, economists advocated the use of administrative measures, such as implementing a congestion toll based on the flights’ frequency (Aravena et al. 2019). The rationale herein is that as the toll increases with flight frequency, its marginal utility diminishes over time, thereby limiting the number of flights. This has been implemented at several global airports, and data show that the introduction of congestion pricing did help the John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport reduce congestion significantly, whereby they charged differential rates during peak hours, especially on smaller aircrafts (Arora et al., 2007).====As a matter of fact, congestion also results in higher carbon emissions (about one million metric tons per year) (Cornwall and Khan, 2019) (Fig. 1). The emission is mainly caused because of the aimless circling of an aircraft, as it awaits landing approval, and/or aircraft awaiting takeoff permission with running engines. With an estimated increase of 155%–300% in emission levels from 2006 to 2036, the staggering environmental impact of air travel has brought the aviation sector on the radar of policymakers (Masiol and Harrison, 2014). Airlines too have been compelled to increase their efforts to reduce carbon footprint, and thereby consider investments in greening initiatives in order to make flying more sustainable. For instance, Air New Zealand initiated the use of fuel extracted from jatropha flowers,==== while Virgin Atlantic made substantial investments in building efficient aircrafts.==== Like Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand, several airlines in the US, have started using alternative fuels. For instance, Southwest and Alaska Airlines from their base at the Los Angeles airport, have established contracts with biofuel producers (Chao et al. 2019). On the other hand, airlines with a limited budget began considering other low-cost alternatives, such as leasing an old or grounded aircraft, while some airlines that are ‘better-off’ tend to opt for ordering a new ‘sustainable’ fleet in order to meet its demands.====Despite some of these initiatives, by and large, airlines seem to be reluctant to commit fully to greening investments, because so far, there is no global binding and penalty on emissions from air travel (Skibsted, 2019). Several economists have argued that implementing carbon tax (CT) as a means to increase greening investment is possibly the best way forward. However, the impact of CT on greening investment policy of airlines still remains unclear, and should be investigated. We believe that such strategic-level investment decisions would provide the airlines with a means to gain competitive advantage, as they would compete on environmental and sustainable issues. In fact, such an initiative is likely to be supported even by ‘environmental-friendly’ passengers, who prefer ‘green services’ because they realize that their consumption behavior does have environmental repercussions (Carlucci et al., 2018). Thus, by increasing green investments (GI), airlines could project their image as environmentally responsible firms, and attract more market share thereof.",Effectiveness of carbon tax and congestion cost in improving the airline industry greening level and welfare: A case of two competing airlines,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000035,29 January 2022,2022,Research Article,133.0

By using the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) aviation data, the forecast methods of Gompertz and Logistic curves and four COVID-19 scenarios, we find the following results. First, the international aviation activities of developing countries are on the track of rapid growth, while the trends of developed countries are relatively slow or even close to saturation. Second, our results provide retrospective support for the decision of the ","; ====; ====), and the estimation that the emission level in 2050 will be 4 to 6 times higher than that in 2010 if emission restriction policies are not implemented (====). As of July 2020, 88 ICAO contracting states have announced their voluntary participation in the pilot phase of CORSIA (====). Most important “aviation countries”, such as the United States, the European Union, Canada, South Korea, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, have decided to participate from 2021. In contrast, countries such as China, Russia, India, and Brazil have not yet indicated their participation. Before the introduction of CORSIA, the European Union planned to include all flights passing through the EU into European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), but this unilateral resolution has been stopped under the opposition of the United States, China and other countries (====).====With the introduction of CORSIA, airlines need to seriously consider how to reduce emissions, so as to operate in a more environmentally friendly way. Many scholars focus on CORSIA, mainly centering on economic impacts, environmental benefits and evaluation. In terms of economic impacts, according to ====, after the implementation of CORSIA, the carbon offsetting costs of global aviation industry will be between 5.3 and 23.9 billion US dollars in 2035, accounting for 0.5%–1.4% of the total revenue of international aviation, but this result does not take into account the pandemic. ==== pointed out that the implementation of CORSIA would cause great economic pressure on the development of aviation industry. ==== estimated that GDP losses of EU27 could reach 1.66%–1.98% by the end of 2020. In terms of environmental benefits, ==== found that CORSIA would offset about 8% of the global aviation industry's carbon emissions. ==== found that an average of 81.5% of international air transport growth during 2021–2035 would be subject to the offset requirements of CORSIA. On the evaluation aspect, some scholars have questioned the fairness of CORSIA. On the one hand, it is difficult to balance the interests of all countries due to its imperfect supervision mechanism (====). On the other hand, that the allocation follows the grandfather mechanism violates the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” (====). However, it may still be the most suitable solution to deal with international aviation emissions (====).====In the context of calling for aviation emission reduction, the rapid spread of COVID-19 has brought a huge negative shock to the international aviation and reduced the international flights significantly. At the beginning, the baseline level of carbon emissions in CORSIA is the average emissions of 2019 and 2020. However, due to the shrinking aviation activities in 2020, this baseline level has been reduced to a large extent, resulting in significantly higher offsetting requirements costs for carriers in future. If the baseline is maintained, the targets of CORSIA will be quite difficult to achieve. In March 2020, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) called on the Council of the ICAO to adjust the carbon emission baseline stipulated in CORSIA in time, so as to avoid the inappropriate economic burden on international aviation and ensure the sustainable development of the sector. In view of this, ICAO made a decision to change the baseline in the summer of 2020. Instead of taking the 2019–2020 average of CO2 emissions from international aviation, the new baseline is now simply the 2019 value, which would ensure the connectivity of international air transport system and contain further impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air carriers to some extent. Even with the huge impact of COVID-19, the implementation time of CORSIA has not been postponed, and global airlines will make joint efforts to achieve the carbon neutral growth target.====Our work makes two main contributions to the literature. First, we are the first to quantify the impact of ICAO's decision to adjust baseline on offsetting requirements, combined with actual emissions, forecast data and scenarios setting. Second, we are the first to estimate the offsetting costs over time as a consequence of the CORSIA rules, the adjusted baseline and COVID-influenced traffic volumes.====The following is the Supplementary data to this article:",How does COVID-19 affect the implementation of CORSIA?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000011,6 January 2022,2022,Research Article,134.0

CART and NN models are developed using FDR data; ADS-B data are used to assess the model performance. The result indicates that the CART model performs better when inputs contain errors and missing values, and the ADS-B data could be used to estimate aircraft fuel consumption as a less-expensive and more convenient strategy compared to the FDR data.","Air transport carried over 35 percent of all good by value and supported 3.5 percent of global GDP as reported by the most recent data in 2019 (International Civil Aviation Organization [ICAO], 2019a). Estimation of aircraft fuel consumption is crucial for a variety of aspects in aviation operations, such as aviation emission reduction, economic flight route planning, and optimal fuel management for aviation operators. While air transport is tremendously facilitating the growth of economy and convenience of social life, sustainable development has been pursued by aviation authorities and a variety of stakeholders considering the remarkable environmental impact from aviation activities. The Committee on Aviation Environment Protection (CAEP) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is an example of initiatives to assist the council for the development of policies and Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) related to aviation environmental impact mitigation (ICAO, n.d.). In addition, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), EUROCONTROL, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and many aviation industry stakeholders also exercised a variety of programs to alleviate the environmental impact created by aviation activities (International Air Transport Association [IATA], n.d.; Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], 2020a; European Union, 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). The four-pillar strategy to mitigate aviation carbon emissions by developing advanced technology, improving aircraft operation efficiency, upgrading existing infrastructure, and adopting economic measures was proposed and implemented by different stakeholders (IATA, 2020; Lufthansa Group, 2020). The ICAO is also pursuing a variety of supplementary measures to achieve the global goals on emission reduction and sustainable growth of international aviation, including aircraft technology improvement, operational improvement, alternative aircraft fuel, and market-based measures (ICAO, 2019b). To measure the progress and effectiveness of different aviation emission mitigation strategies, the Emission and Dispersion Modelling System (EDMS) was developed in mid-1980s and upgraded to a more advanced solution – the Aviation Environment Design Tool, Version 3c (AEDT, V.3c) as of March 6, 2020 (FAA, 2020b). The AEDT 3c is required to be used for all FAA aviation noise, fuel burn, and emissions modeling actions in the U.S. (FAA, 2020b). The ICAO's Fuel Savings Estimation Tool (IFSET) also provides another option for countries that do not have available detailed measurement or modeling of fuel savings (ICAO, 2016). Other examples of strategies, including the Advanced Emissions Model (AEM), Open-ALAQS, and IMPACT, are developed by European agencies for estimation and analysis of aircraft fuel consumption and emissions (EUROCONTROL, n.d.).====Among different aircraft fuel consumption and emission assessment approaches, the phases of flight, durations of each phase of flight, fuel flow rate, and aircraft engine emission index of exhausted emissions are widely used for estimating the total fuel consumption or volume of exhaust emissions by the phases of flight, as shown in Eq. (1) (ICAO, 2017).====where ==== is the total volume of emission ==== (kg), ==== is the sum of phases of flight during a time period, ==== is the aircraft engine emission index for a specific pollutant ==== in the phase of flight ==== (kg-exhaust chemical/kg-fuel burned), ==== is the average fuel flow rate in the phase of flight ==== (kg-fuel/s), ==== is a certain phase of flight, and ==== is the duration of the phase of flight ==== (s).====In current practice, the information of fuel flow rate could be obtained from a variety of channels, for example, many on-board flight data recording devices log aircraft fuel flow rate and the total fuel consumption information; some advanced aircraft powerplant management systems also track and monitor fuel consumption. However, those strategies not only require an expensive investment in advanced flight data recording and analytics technologies, but also involve latency and inconvenience as most flight data become available only when flights are completed. Moreover, relying on advanced flight data recorder (FDR) or powerplant management system excludes a large number of general aviation (GA) aircraft which are usually not equipped or compatible with existing technologies for direct fuel consumption monitoring and recording. Therefore, the development of an inexpensive and effective strategy to estimate aircraft fuel consumption is necessary for all aviation operators.====As one of the critical elements in aircraft fuel consumption estimation, the fuel flow rate can be derived from the statistical relationship with other aircraft operational parameters. In 2012, Khadilkar and Balakrishnan modeled commercial aircraft fuel consumption while taxiing using flight data recorder information (Khadilkar and Balakrishnan, 2012). Baklacioglu et al. published studies on aircraft fuel flow rate modeling for phases of flight using different modeling strategies (Baklacioglu, 2015, 2016, 2021; Oruc and Baklacioglu, 2020). The fuel flow rate during the airborne phases of flight was modeled using flight data recorder data from turbofan aircraft (Chati and Balakrishnan, 2016). Considering the operational and performance difference of GA aircraft, Huang et al. modeled the fuel flow rate of reciprocating-engine GA aircraft using aircraft operational data (Huang et al., 2017). Instead of adopting the LTO cycle, Pagoni and Psaraki-Kalouptsidi proposed a flight path profile based method to calculate aircraft fuel consumption focusing on the Climb-Cruise-Descent (CCD) cycle (Pagoni and Psaraki-Kalouptsidi, 2017). Because the actual performance of a flight is usually affected by a variety of unforeseeable factors, such as weather, delay, and detour, flight trajectory simulation-based models were recently developed for more accurate fuel burn computation (Yanto and Liem, 2018; Seymour et al., 2020). Aforementioned studies developed mathematical foundations for fuel consumption estimation from different perspectives.====However, most published studies focused on modeling aircraft fuel consumption using FDR data without discussing the difficulties and cost of obtaining such data, therefore, how to practically and widely use those theoretical models remains unsolved. From a practical perspective, this paper presents a strategy of estimating aircraft fuel consumption by leveraging the advantages of existing avionics systems equipped by most aircraft and statistical modeling of historical aircraft fuel consumption data. FDR data with fuel consumption information were used for statistical modeling, and Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) data were used for the assessment of model performance.",Estimation of aircraft fuel consumption by modeling flight data from avionics systems,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722000023,6 January 2022,2022,Research Article,135.0

However, previous papers have neglected to distinguish between domestic and international markets and to think about spatial units. This paper examines the factors of passenger air traffic for the whole world and considers both national and sub-national units. The study finds that the relevant factors partially diverge between domestic and international markets. It also appears that it is more valuable to consider sub-national spatial units than countries, notwithstanding ==== results. Indeed, the geography of residuals is much richer by sub-national units, while national units clearly mask centre-periphery patterns and/or significant disparities within large countries.","Apart from periods in which there were major economic and health crises, air transport has been growing fast over the past few decades (IATA, 2018). As a result, it is not surprising academic research on aviation has expanded in tandem with the growth of air transport (see Oum and Zhang, 2001; Ginieis et al., 2012; Duval, 2013). In this context, determining the factors of air traffic has been a recurrent goal pursued by economists, engineers and geographers since the 1950s.====However, as the next section argues, research works interested in the determinants of air traffic have usually not been very ambitious in spatial terms. Indeed, the usual spatial framework is restricted to one country as a whole or by sub-national units (usually the first level of administrative units beyond the national level, such as China's or Turkey's provinces or the states of Brazil or the US). Transnational research works are scarce and are usually limited to one specific macro-region (including Europe, South-eastern Asia and North America) or the whole world, but usually restricted to so-called world cities (e.g., Taylor et al., 2007) (see Section 2). Furthermore, the few researches that have covered the whole world have been restricted to the country level or to selected city-pairs given the difficulty of gathering coherent, sub-national statistics all over the world. However, working at the country level is not an obvious optimum. On the one hand, it is clear that despite recurrent prophecies that countries will not be relevant any more in trying to understand social, economic and political processes, countries still play a significant role in many matters (Swyngedouw, 2005; Polese, 2005). In the context of aviation policy, countries are usually still in charge of negotiating bilateral and multilateral air transport agreements (Debbage, 2014).==== On the other hand, countries are not spatially homogeneous entities (see, e.g., European Commission, 2020). The geography of population density, for example, does not tell the same story at the national vs. the sub-national levels (Fig. 1). And, very similarly, the geography of air services at the airport level is clearly more subtle than at the national one (Fig. 2). It is only at sub-national levels that the high contrasts in settlement or in air traffic (e.g., US coast vs. inland; eastern/south-eastern China vs. inland China; North Africa vs. the Sahel; etc.) are visible.====Another issue in previous research works is the fact that domestic and international markets have usually not been compared (see Section 2). Either the investigation was restricted to only one market (namely, domestic or international) or no distinction was made between these two markets. However, factors that are relevant for domestic air markets are not necessarily relevant (or even play in the same direction) for international air markets, and conversely.====In this context, the paper's aim is to revisit the determinants of air services on the world scale, (1) considering separately domestic and international markets, and (2) working on two different scales, namely countries and sub-national units. The remaining parts are as follows. The next section provides a literature review, with a focus on spaces covered and scale considered by previous research. Section 3 introduces our research strategy and the data utilised. Section 4 revisits the determinants of air services through multiple regressions. It also thinks beyond the models through the investigation of the geography of the models' residuals.

Crude oil price risk may be increasingly prevalent as societies promote ====. Furthermore, we present foundational knowledge that promotes further research and knowledge representing a caveat to traditional relationships between commodity prices and transportation firms’ financial performance.","Commercial helicopter services in the Gulf of Mexico are utilized for the transportation of supplies and personnel to and from offshore facilities engaged in exploration, drilling, production and abandonment activities in pursuit of crude oil and natural gas. In essence, the energy industry's workforce commutes to offshore facilities via helicopter. Within the Gulf of Mexico basin, there are 5 operators and include Westwind Helicopters, Inc., PHI, Inc., Era Group, Inc., Bristow Group, Inc. and RLC LLC (HSAC, 2021). Three firms, PHI, Inc., Era Group Inc., and Bristow Group Inc., conduct operations globally whereas the remaining firms exclusively operate domestically. Furthermore, based on aircraft deployed in Gulf of Mexico operations, PHI Inc., Era Group Inc. and Bristow Group Inc. operate the vast majority of aircraft in this basin. Globally, energy-related commercial helicopter services are utilized in numerous countries including, but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Cyprus, Ghana, Guyana, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and the United Kingdom. Within these offshore oil basins, commercial helicopter operations are conducted by international and domestic firms. According to a leading helicopter manufacturer, AgustaWestland, oil and gas helicopters accounted for 26% of the global helicopter fleet. According to the commercial helicopter operators' annual reports, the fleet is partially leased and partially owned (Bristow Group Inc, 2018; ERA Group Inc, 2018; PHI Inc, 2018). To date, the extant literature focusing on this segment of the aviation industry is mostly comprised of studies that have evaluated optimized routing (Diaz-Parra et al., 2017; Galvão and Guimarães, 1990; Sierksma and Tijssen, 1998; Velasco et al., 2012), airfield locations (Hermeto et al., 2014) and fleet compositions (Hermeto et al., 2014).====In lieu of a daily commute, offshore workers typically work and live at their respective offshore facility for 14-day work cycles and are replaced by a counterpart after the work period (Kaiser, 2009). These cycles occur throughout the year and do not observe holidays or other operational disruptions. Although there may exist operations elsewhere that differ in work schedules, the work environment described in the Gulf of Mexico is predominantly prevalent across all offshore energy basins. Commercial helicopter operators, to varying degrees, rely on this key market for the derivation of revenues. Specifically, the demand for helicopter services is hypothesized to be a function of offshore activity, which is influenced by the prevalent price of commodities sought, crude oil and natural gas. Consequently, there may exist strategic risks within this segment of the industry due to fluctuations in the underlying commodity markets. Although these firms are known to rely on their respective contracts serving oil and gas firms, it is not known to which degree their stock returns are related to the prices of the abovementioned commodities. Furthermore, it is unknown if firms’ stock returns fluctuate in unison with the rotary rig count, which is a count of active drilling rigs. Through this research, practitioners and researchers will gain a more thorough understanding of these phenomena and, consequently, be able to develop and execute strategies for future practice and research, respectively.====Beginning in 2008, the price of crude oil had dropped significantly and, as a result, the utilization of helicopters in the energy industry had decreased. Commercial helicopter operators relying on this market subsequently sold assets, deferred aircraft purchases and reduced workforces (Cameron, 2016). These phenomena support the notion that commercial helicopter operators in the energy industry may be engaged in a dynamic environment as defined by the extant literature. Dynamic environments have been broadly described as possessing observable or foreseeable changes that occur rapidly and significantly impact an entity or industry, which can be positive or negative (Figueira de Lemos and Hadjikhani, 2014). Though there exists no universal measure to identify a dynamic environment in which a firm or industry operates, particular phenomena and subsequent results adequately support the notion of a dynamic environment. In some cases, dynamic environments have been described as having “fleeting opportunities and urgent threats” (p. 1123), which require rapid reorganization or reconfiguration (Girod and Whittington, 2017). One such phenomenon is a significant change in an industry's fundamental characteristics, which may be induced by an emergent technology, governmental regulation or supply and demand movements or shifts.====Commercial helicopter firms' revenues, to varying degrees, are directly and indirectly dependent on their client's investment and operational activities. Crude oil prices and subsequent fuel prices have been found to negatively impact transportation firms as fuel is a significant variable expense (Aggarwal et al., 2012; Yun and Yoon, 2019). Specifically, airlines' stock returns exhibit a negative relationship with oil prices even as airlines, to varying degrees, have implemented fuel hedging strategies (Mohanty et al., 2014). Although fuel hedging strategies mitigate the impact of fluctuating fuel prices, the relationship between fuel prices and airlines' stock returns are negative at the industry and firm levels of analysis (Kang et al., 2021). Importantly, crude oil prices impact various industries and segments of industries differently (Kristjanpoller and Concha, 2016). In contrast to commercial airlines, commercial helicopter operators' stock returns may be positively related to crude oil prices as a positive demand factor in lieu of a negative expense factor.====The current study evaluates the explanatory power of energy industry variables on commercial helicopter firms' stock returns. Specifically, this paper focuses on four questions: What is the impact of the price of crude oil on firms' stock returns? What is the impact of the price of natural gas on firms' stock returns? What is the impact of the rotary rig count on firms' stock returns? Lastly, what is the relationship of the S&P 500 and firms' stock returns? There are numerous factors influencing the stock returns of public firms. In this paper, the objective is to empirically investigate external industry-specific variables and test their respective explanatory power in affecting stock returns of commercial helicopter operators. In accordance with Allen and Fildes (2001), the evaluation of the abovementioned relationships is conducted via ordinary least squares multivariate regression, which is based on economic theory, relatively simplistic and an apt estimation method. If the prices of crude oil and natural gas can explain the stock returns of commercial helicopter firms, firms may be able to utilize current prices and commodity futures markets to assist in risk analysis, contract stipulations and operational and investment decisions. Similarly, the rotary rig count may exhibit explanatory power enabling commercial helicopter firms to assess real-time market conditions impacting their stock returns. Although diversification is prescribed for some firms and industries, strict adherence to core competencies and resultant efficiencies, in contrast, may yield favorable stock returns. Therefore, it is worthwhile empirically examining whether commercial helicopter operators may benefit from a higher degree of business diversification in terms of stock return, and the empirical findings from this paper would be helpful in validating much of the anecdotal information available. Lastly, the transportation sector's financial performance has been found to be negatively related to crude oil prices. Although this relationship is observable within the sector, the phenomenon may not be universal and, consequently, divergent within the context of this study. This study aims to provide, if supported by empirical analysis, a refinement to such understanding.====In the following section, the extant literature is reviewed, which reinforces data selection, hypotheses development and the contribution of this novel study.

It is shown that an airport finds it profitable to share concession revenues with airlines and this increases both consumer surplus and social welfare. The airport prefers an exclusive agreement when the net per passenger revenue generated on non-aeronautical services at the airport is sufficiently low; it extracts higher payments by exploiting the competition between airlines to become the sole signatory. The level of aeronautical charges, that are regulated, influences the airport’s decision and, consequently, the intensity of airline competition. Welfare is higher under a non-exclusive arrangement, which may be in conflict with the airport’s decision. The incentive to use these contracts remains under airport competition and revenue sharing increases. With an airline alliance, revenue sharing increases traffic for a large enough degree of cooperation between airlines.","Airports have played a fundamental role in the air transport industry as public infrastructures serving the needs of airlines and passengers. However, in recent times airports have been under pressure to become more financially self-sufficient and leave off relying on public funds. Since aeronautical services are regulated, airports have turned their looks at non-aeronautical activities, which have become an increasing source of revenues. The [1] discloses that 39.4% of airport revenues are non-aeronautical, although there are airports such as Hong Kong (HKG) or Tampa (TPA) that obtain more than 70% of their revenues through non-aeronautical activities according to [2]. With the growth of concession revenues, a more competitive environment has pushed up the use of revenue sharing contracts, whereby an airport shares its commercial revenues with airlines. Despite this, not all airports use them and, among those that do, agreements may be signed with just one (possibly dominant) airline while others embrace several airlines [13]. Our paper contributes to the literature that studies the effects of concession revenue sharing contracts by endogenizing the choice of the signatory airline. We shall investigate the consequences on competition and the welfare implications of having either an exclusive or a non-exclusive contract.====In practice, revenue sharing is becoming popular. For example, Tampa International Airport has been sharing revenue with airlines since 2000. In 2006, it shared 20% of its net revenue with its signatory airlines. The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (2010) is also implementing similar revenue sharing arrangements covering the 2009 to 2013 fiscal years. The revenue remaining after satisfying all requirements is between the parties, with 30% allocated to signatory airlines and 70% allocated to the airport authority in the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, and respective shares of 25% and 75% applying in 2011–2013. The signatory airline share is distributed among the airlines based on each airline’s share of enplaned passengers. In 2002, the Frankfurt Airport signed a five-year agreement with Lufthansa and other airlines showing a non-exclusive concession behavior.====The regulation of the aeronautical part of airport business has been preceded from the consideration of airports as natural monopolies. However, several features such as the airline market structure, the level of competition between airports or the vertical relationship between airports and airlines affect airports’ decisions, and there are studies that support the theory that the presence of non-aeronautical income prevents airports from increasing their aeronautical charges [17], [24]. Therefore, the positive externality of the demand for aviation services on the demand for commercial services reduces an airport’s incentive to exploit its market power and to set higher aeronautical charges [14], yet this need not be so in the case of foresighted passengers [7].====Airports and airlines have incentives to establish agreements since both provide perfectly complementary services. Airports provide a necessary input for the air transport industry and airlines bring in passengers who use airport commercial facilities and contribute to their profitability. By signing those agreements, airports ensure a portion of future traffic and profits, and signatory airlines participate in the commercial revenue associated with more traffic while possibly establishing a dominant position at the airport thus gaining a competitive advantage over other airlines. Several types of vertical agreements are found in the literature. [12] point out five types: signatory airlines of airports, airline ownership or control of airport facilities, long-term use contracts, airport issuance of revenue bonds to airlines, and concession revenue sharing between airports and airlines. [3] and [9] analyzed three types of vertical agreements in a situation with and without competition. Their results mainly point out anti-competitive concerns about vertical agreements, since signatory airlines benefit from their position inside the airport. Furthermore, [4] find that price rebate contracts, where airports ensure a level of traffic in exchange for a discount in airlines charges, are not sustainable.====Concession revenue sharing contracts certainly allow airports and airlines to internalize the externalities that arise in their vertical relationships. These arrangements, which are the object of our analysis, may increase traffic volumes as well as joint profit. However, there are strategic effects at play that may give rise to undesirable consumer surplus and welfare consequences, hence the opportunity of our contribution.====In the literature, [23] were the first to introduce this kind of contracts following a traditional approach, which regards that an airport’s demand is directly a function of an airport’s own decisions. Our paper is closely related to several recent studies under the vertical structure approach, where the downstream market is modeled, and airports and airlines are vertically related. [13] focused on the effects of revenue sharing contracts. They found that concession revenue sharing increases welfare, but it can have negative effects on competition among airlines, due to the fact that it increases the market power of signatory airlines. Their analysis though does not discuss whether an airport prefers equal revenue sharing among all airlines or exclusive revenue sharing. Moreover, [22] analyzes how the sharing varies depending on the structure of the downstream market. In a fairly rich analysis, these authors emphasize the relevance of how airlines’ services are related to each other in establishing the degree of revenue sharing; they also suggest that airport competition strengthens vertical cooperation but the welfare consequences are ambiguous. [15] consider several airports and several airlines in a network model. Users value flight duration, schedule delay and connection times, so that airlines, for every revenue share offered by an airport, sequentially decide on airfares and flight frequencies. The authors propose a three-step solving procedure for airports’ choices of revenue share in which airports extract all profit from airlines. Their numerical analysis unveils that an airport will find it profitable to share its commercial revenues with the dominant carrier, and may also share with non-dominant carriers. We extend their analysis by also endogenizing the cooperating parties in the agreement under alternative assumptions while formally characterizing the airports’ contract choice. Besides, we provide conditions on the per passenger aeronautical charges and the per passenger net revenue from non-aeronautical services that establish an airport’s choice between exclusive and non-exclusive revenue sharing contracts. We further discuss the welfare effects of either contract type and examine the effects brought by airport competition and an airline alliance.====Our analysis confirms and complements earlier findings in the literature. Thus, we show that indeed the airport is willing to sign a concession revenue sharing contract. Although the airport gives away part of its non-aeronautical revenues, it can positively influence the downstream market by increasing traffic, which also raises revenues. Besides, our research discloses that if per passenger net surplus from commercial services is large enough, the airport prefers to sign a non-exclusive sharing agreement. On the other hand, with relatively small values of per passenger net surplus, the airport prefers to make an exclusive sharing offer to generate a greater impact through a single airline. Our model describes a new important role played by institutions. The aeronautical part of the airport business is regulated, therefore, under this regulation they can also influence the decision of the airport to opt for a certain type of revenue sharing contract. Then, under the conjecture that vertical contracts may affect competition in the downstream market, institutions can choose an aeronautical charge that induces a shift in the equilibrium airport decision from granting exclusive to non-exclusive sharing contracts, or vice versa. In this way, all airlines are allowed to appropriate the positive externality they help generate, in addition to taking advantage of the benefits for society that this type of contract has. In line with the received literature, concession revenue sharing contracts increase traffic and social welfare. However, under certain conditions, there exists a misalignment between what passengers prefer and what is chosen by the airport.====Finally, some of the results can be extended to the case of airport competition. In particular, we find that an airport prefers to use concession revenue sharing contracts given the rival does not, and that non-exclusive concession revenue sharing contracts provide more sharing than exclusive one. Besides, when airline services are rather differentiated, the existence of a competing airport induces an increase in the equilibrium sharing proportions. To end, in case airlines form an alliance, airports typically share more of its commercial revenues to alliance partners as compared to the case with no alliance when the relative (airport vs airline) profit margin is large enough.====The next Section sets out the model and presents the main result.

New cost-effective implementations will also enable the appropriate integration of small and medium-sized airports into the aviation network. The required data can increasingly be gathered and processed by the airports themselves. For example, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) messages are sent by arriving and departing aircraft and enable a data-driven analysis of aircraft movements, taking into account local constraints (e.g., weather or capacity). Analytical and model-based approaches that leverage these data also offer deeper insights into the complex and interdependent airport operations. This includes systematic monitoring of relevant operational milestones as well as a corresponding predictive analysis to estimate future system states. In fact, local ADS-B receivers can be purchased, installed, and maintained at low cost, providing both very good coverage of the airport apron operations (runway, taxi system, parking positions) and communication of current airport performance to the network management. To prevent every small and medium-sized airport from having to develop its own monitoring system, we present a basic concept with our approach. We demonstrate that appropriate processing of ADS-B messages leads to improved situational awareness. Our concept is aligned with the operational milestones of Eurocontrol’s Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) framework. Therefore, we analyze the A-CDM airport London–Gatwick Airport as it allows us to validate our concept against the data from the A-CDM implementation at a later stage. Finally, with our research, we also make a decisive contribution to the open-data and scientific community.","Shared situational awareness at airports enables operational challenges to be successfully addressed. In this context, performance-based collaboration among airport stakeholders enabled by the concept of airport collaborative decision making (A-CDM) (Eurocontrol Airport CDM Team, 2017) could improve the efficiency of both the aviation network and the local airport (Pickup, 2016). A-CDM is an information-sharing process focused on defined operational milestones along aircraft trajectories and is part of the European Air Traffic Management Master Plan under the Single European Sky initiative (SESAR JU, 2015). Within the Airport Operations Center (SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2016), stakeholders monitor the agreed performance targets in their respective responsibility areas and implement appropriate control measures in the event of (expected) deviations at both land and airside (Günther et al., 2006, Helm et al., 2015, Kosanke and Schultz, 2015).====The digitalization of operational processes at and around airports will facilitate further optimization of operations and the development of new processes soon (Airports Council International Europe, 2018). New technological improvements will take place at the local and aviation network level to provide seamless passenger and freight transport. The amount of data exchanged in the airport environment has increased significantly and with it the need for methods to analyze this data and turn it into knowledge. Using data from a variety of sources (including publicly available data), airports can make better predictions about future system states and the efficacy of mitigation strategies. Data analytics and machine learning approaches can reveal hidden correlations in the complex airport system.====In our work, we investigate the capabilities of data-driven performance monitoring for small and medium-sized airports, which could be extended to include predictive capabilities in a future research step. Thus, we introduce a concept of data-driven airport management where operational milestones are derived from aircraft ADS-B messages (A-CDM-lite). We use London–Gatwick Airport as a demonstration environment to show our approach to data preparation and milestone calculation. Although it is not one of the small and medium-sized airports, we chose it for the following reasons. First, the airport is well covered with ADS-B receivers so that not only flying aircraft around the airport but also their ground movements on the entire apron can be captured and processed. Second, the airport has a simple runway layout, so extensive differentiation of complex runway or apron procedures is not required. Third, Gatwick is already an A-CDM airport, and the next step in our research is to compare the results of our approach with the actual A-CDM milestones.====After this introduction of the performance management in the airport environment and a brief literature review is given in Section 2. Section 3 provides a deeper insight into the fundamentals of the A-CDM concept and potential roadblocks for the implementation at small/medium-sized airports. In Section 4, the A-CDM-lite concept for small and medium-sized airports is proposed considering a tailored set of milestones derived from locally received ADS-B messages. Section 5 provides our methodology to derive an operational representation of the underlying airport environment. In Section 6 we use 10 days of operational data for analyzing the actual airport performance.

Solving the Airplane Seating Assignment Problem (ASAP) produces seating arrangements that minimize transmission risks between passengers aboard an aircraft, but the chosen risk model affects the optimal seating arrangement. We analyze previous risk models and introduce two new risk models, masked and unmasked, based on previous experiments performed aboard real aircraft to test aerosol dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 sized particles. We make recommendations on when each risk model is applicable and the types of seating arrangements that are optimal for each risk model.","SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has caused over three million deaths worldwide and is continuing to kill nearly 50,000 people per week as of 14 November 2021 (====). SARS-CoV-2 was first detected as cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and then identified as a new type of coronavirus on 7 January 2020 (====). The virus rapidly spread and by the end of January 2020 had reached Southeast Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, with almost 10,000 cases in China and more than 100 confirmed cases across 19 countries outside of China (====).====Some people confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 are completely asymptomatic while they are able to spread the disease to others for long periods of time (====, ====). This makes it more difficult to detect infectious passengers as they board international flights, leading to those passengers spreading the disease after arriving at their destination. Furthermore, in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed on multiple international flights (====There are many different seating arrangements for a plane that is partially full, such as pushing everyone to the front, letting passengers space themselves out, or blocking middle seats. Given a plane full of passengers, some of which are infected with SARS-CoV-2, some seating arrangements will have a lower risk of creating secondary infections. ==== presents the Airplane Seating Assignment Problem (ASAP) with the goal of minimizing the total transmission risk between passengers by placing passengers into an optimal seating configuration.====The optimal seating arrangement for ASAP depends critically on the input risk model, which assigns relative risk scores to pairs of passengers based on their seat positions on the assumption that either passenger could infect the other. This paper extends ==== by introducing two new risk models based on recent aerosol dispersion tests with and without passengers wearing surgical masks (====). ASAP seating arrangements are compared under the different risk models to make recommendations.====Transmission risk models depend on the possible modes of transmission. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by droplets, contact, fecal-oral, and airborne modes (====). Droplets are particles generated during breathing, talking, and coughing that can infect another person if they reach their mouth, nose, or eyes. Contact transmission occurs when a person touches an object that contains particles of the virus; it includes both direct contact, such as shaking hands, and fomite transmission, such as touching a surface contaminated with virus particles (====). Fecal-oral transmission occurs when any fecal matter from an infectious person is ingested, such as from a contaminated water supply. Airborne transmission occurs from droplets that are small enough to stay suspended in the air instead of falling to the ground. ASAP minimizes the risks of transmission between seated passengers during a flight and does not include risks when the passengers board or deboard the airplane (====). Therefore, we are concerned primarily with droplet and airborne transmission modes for SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk models aboard aircraft.====If masks are being worn, then the type of mask also has a significant impact on the risk models for ASAP. As of January 21, 2021, masks in compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines are required to be worn on all commercial aircraft in the United States (====). A compliant mask is essentially a cloth mask of two or more layers that completely covers the nose and mouth (====). Cloth mask efficacy varies significantly depending on material choice and fit, but they are generally effective at blocking large respiratory droplets by providing a mechanical barrier (====, ====). Given the effectiveness of cloth masks and current wear guidelines, risk models based on data collected with masks worn should be used for ASAP.====Once a risk model has been selected, ASAP can be solved by using the Vertex Packing Risk minimization (VPR) and Risk-Constrained Vertex packing (RCV) mixed-integer linear programming models (====). Both models require an input graph representing the airplane layout with pairwise risk scores between seats, which are determined by the chosen risk model. VPR fixes the number of passengers and finds a seating arrangement that minimizes total risk, and RCV fixes a maximum total risk and finds a seating arrangement with as many passengers as possible. Both models can be solved using an off-the-shelf commercial solver such as CPLEX.====One notable limitation of both VPR and RCV for solving ASAP is that they assume all passengers are indistinguishable; nothing specific is known about any individual passengers. Every passenger should have an equal chance of being infectious and can possibly infect any other passenger. If those assumptions are not true, for example, if some passengers are from the same family and therefore have different risks relative to each other than to other passengers, then the total risks computed by VPR and RCV may not accurately reflect real-world transmission risks. Further research is needed to develop heterogeneous risk models that could be applied to such instances.====The paper is organized as follows. Section ==== analyzes the risk models that define which seats are considered high-risk relative to an index passenger. Section ==== examines the seating arrangements produced by each of the risk models on two representative airplanes (capacities 124 and 289).

The ICPPAM solves the passenger mix problem on every flight segment, leveraging endogenous demand estimates based on an empirical discrete choice model. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach to the large-scale network of Ryanair in 2019. Results highlight that the proposed approach can significantly aid airlines’ decision-making, leading to significant revenue improvements (up to 4.4%) and shedding insights into network development alternatives.","Historically, the aviation industry has been characterized by a clear dichotomy between full-service (FSC) and low-cost (LCC) carriers. In recent years, however, airlines have been undergoing a profound hybridization process that has blurred the traditional boundary between these two business models.====One of the key differences that traditionally distinguished FSCs and LCCs relates to their network structures. FSCs have traditionally developed hub-and-spoke (H&S) networks—involving a set of (spoke) airports linked to a focal transfer hub such that passengers can be routed through the hub to get from their origin to the final destination. The main advantage of this network configuration lies in the efficient consolidation and redistribution of demand from several spoke cities, which enable an airline to serve a vast number of O–D markets with the fewest number of direct routes and eventually obtain economies of scale. By contrast, LCCs have mostly relied on a more linear point-to-point (P2P) architecture—involving a set of direct routes serving individual and potentially dispersed airport pairs. P2P operations avoid costs related to hubbing facilities, as well as organizational and managerial complexities associated with planning and operations of H&S systems. In particular, in a pure P2P network, all passengers board at the flight origin and deplane at the destination, thus avoiding the issue of shared supply, which inevitably requires complex passenger allocation and seat inventory control mechanisms to prevent revenue cannibalization between low and high-yield passengers traveling in economically distinct markets (Talluri and Van Ryzin, 1998, Barnhart et al., 2002, Belobaba et al., 2015). Furthermore, in a P2P setting, synergies among flights are limited, avoiding issues of schedule coordination at the hub(s)—which tend to cause lower turnaround times, as well as lower asset and crew utilization—and reducing delay propagation in case of disruptions. In turn, the implementation of point-to-point networks allowed LCCs to simplify and streamline operations, eventually reducing operating costs (Cook and Goodwin, 2008).====In the wake of hybridization, major LCCs, such as Ryanair, Vueling, Norwegian, and Eurowings, have begun providing connecting itineraries by combining their existing flights and implementing integrated ticketing and checked-through baggage handling solutions. Several studies have investigated the rationale and the related business opportunities. A number of early contributions focused on quantifying the degree of “indirect” connectivity and self-hubbing potential delivered by the current network of LCCs, highlighting that combining LCCs’ flights may give rise to a significant number of feasible and attractive connecting opportunities (Malighetti et al., 2008, Maertens et al., 2016, Cattaneo et al., 2017). The more recent works by Klophaus and Fichert, 2019, Morlotti et al., 2020, and Klophaus et al. (2021) investigated the characteristics of online connections provided by LCCs, focusing on the largest independent LCCs in Europe, i.e., Ryanair, Easyjet, and Wizzair. As a key takeaway, LCCs’ connection strategy appears today immature and experimental, for three main reasons. First, route selection is not carried out systematically—e.g., in 2019, Ryanair only activated about 4% of potential connecting itineraries and without a clear pattern. Second, flight schedules are not optimized to facilitate short connecting times—e.g., Ryanair’s provided connections feature a transfer time above 150 min (250 min, on average). Third, pricing on connecting itineraries follows a simple additive rule—e.g., Ryanair’s price on one-stop itineraries is roughly given by the sum of the two flight legs’ prices plus an additional amount (about 10–15 Euro) (Cattaneo et al., 2018). While this avoids the problem of revenue cannibalization, it also denotes minimal (if not totally absent) revenue optimization, ultimately reducing the potential profit. Collectively, these previous works have extensively shown the connectivity potential of LCCs’ networks in Europe. In parallel, a number of studies have developed centrality measures to characterize an airport’s position and route connections in air transport networks (e.g., Cheung et al., 2020). Yet, these studies provide a ==== rather than ==== approach; they focus primarily on the supply side and neglect a systematic evaluation of demand potential, thus only providing a partial appraisal of business potentialities originating from the implementation of connecting services.====In this paper, we contribute to literature and practice by developing an integrated optimization framework to assist LCCs’ connection planning. The proposed modeling framework—referred to as ====—estimates itinerary demand based on a discrete choice model using historical data and considering key itinerary attributes. The derived demand function is incorporated into a supply-side network optimization model, thus yielding an explicit treatment of supply–demand interactions. Subject to the current provision of flights, the model aims at maximizing an airline’s profits by simultaneously selecting through which airports to enable connections and which specific connections to make available. The ICPPAM is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem (MINLP), which is linearized to be efficiently solved by commercial MILP solvers.====To illustrate the benefits that can be derived by the application of the ICPPAM, a real-world case study is conducted considering the network of Ryanair in 2019. We appraise the business opportunities of introducing connecting itineraries via multiple airports, under two alternative pricing strategies: an ====, which replicates the approach currently used by Ryanair and defines the price of Ryanair’s connecting itineraries as the sum of the prices of the two flight segments, and what we call ====, according to which Ryanair’s itineraries are given an average price that is aligned to the price of itineraries with similar characteristics serving the same market. Through comparison with a baseline network, which reflects the current situation—absent connecting itineraries and consisting of only local nonstop traffic—our results highlight substantial business opportunities that Ryanair could exploit by optimizing its connection strategy over the existing network of flights. Under a market-based pricing strategy, the revenues increase is estimated to be as high as 4.37% (with 10 activated transfer airports). On the other hand, much smaller revenue improvements (1.85%) are observed when an additive pricing strategy is used. These improvements follow from two main reasons: first, the capturing of passengers from new markets served through connecting itineraries, and, second, the optimization of the passenger mix on each flight. Additionally, these results highlight how the target airline should be able to implement a sophisticated, market-based pricing strategy to fully exploit the benefits related to the introduction of connecting flights. This, in practice, would require substantial investments in revenue management and inventory systems. In this respect, the proposed model can be useful to carefully evaluate the adoption and implementation of these systems.====We conclude the paper with a set of modeling extensions to corroborate the numerical results and highlight how the ICPPAM can be leveraged to inform on the impacts of variations in the itinerary connecting times, operating costs, and seating capacity (either an increase or decrease). These analyses highlight the potential for future research to integrate the strategic decisions addressed by the ICPPAM with more tactical and operational considerations. Furthermore, they also highlight the use of the ICPPAM as a valuable tool to pursue an efficient allocation of existing (or new) capacity, which constitutes a strategic aspect in the upcoming rebuilding of airline networks that were devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The safety management system of NAVAIDs aims to ensure the safety of aircraft navigation by minimizing defects in safety devices and systems. This study presents the safety maturity assessment methodology of NAVAIDs that can be used to improve the safety management and quality of NAVAIDs through analysis studies on the applicability of safety management evaluation methods. This study proposes a practice-centered evaluation model for NAVAIDs, based on the safety maturity evaluation methodology of Eurocontrol. This study adopts a quantitative-qualitative assessment method for the navigation safety maturity assessment methodology, presents practical safety level assessment measures divided into facility management and safety management areas, and secures objectivity and reliability of assessment by weighing each item. The NAVAIDs safety maturity assessment methodology in this study is applied to the NAVAIDs maintenance field to objectively evaluate the navigation service level at the airport and share the results to contribute to air safety by improving the management system and preventing safety accidents.","In aviation, all airports certified to comply with the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are required to implement the Safety Management System (SMS) from November 2005 (Chang et al., 2015; ICAO, 2018). According to the ICAO Safety Management Manual (SMM), the SMS is operated as a means of management for the safety management of the organization. In addition, the ICAO mandates the implementation of the safety management system (SMS) as a means of ensuring safe operation of airports, eliminating the possibility of safety accidents and reducing human error (Baber et al., 1997; Na and Yoo, 2018). The purpose of this study is to measure the safety experience of NAVAIDs to change the attitude and perception of NAVAIDs workers about unsafe behavior by implementing the SMS (Remawi et al., 2011).====In 2002, Eurocontrol commissioned an independent investigation into the Air Traffic Management (ATM) safety regulations of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) State and the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) to ensure that safety conditions are met. European ATM was developed in a safe and efficient manner through a program established by the Eurocontrol on behalf of the ECAC. The assessment of the ATM safety management system is based on the introduction of the SMS and the framework of the safety management system. The motivation for this study is to provide the ANSP with the following useful means of relating to the operation and technical safety of navigation safety facilities: First, it determines the level of SMS improvement within the NAVAIDs field, secondly the degree to which safety learning is transferred within the NAVAIDs field, and thirdly provides a path to focus on continuous safety improvement activities. Therefore, the method of evaluating the safety maturity of the NAVAIDs in this study assesses to what extent maintenance essentials such as organizational management, safety and risk management, policy standards and procedures management, training and working environment are met.====The direction of the evaluation shall be firstly applied to the field of navigation facility evaluation system by benchmarking safety maturity evaluation model fraud techniques, such as excellent operations. Secondly, an evaluation model is developed through the excavation of key components for quantitative measurement of navigation facility maintenance safety. Third, the safety maturity evaluation model is verified by a group of internal experts who have external public confidence.====Further surveys were subsequently conducted in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008, with Eurocontrol presenting a roadmap for the development of key ATM safety performance indicators (Licu and Grace-Kelly, 2009). The ICAO safety assessment roadmap at the regional level was expanded to the ICAO Euro area adjacent to the ECAC and Eastern Europe. In 2012, Korea introduced a roadmap to evaluate safety awareness for the first time in the field of NAVAIDs, providing an opportunity to develop an improved safety management system for NAVAIDs.====In the domestic aviation sector, sufficient consensus has been formed since the 1997 Guam crash that the role of airports and airline safety culture should be improved, but more than five air accidents have occurred every year since then. Such accidents revealed social problems with safety management and were recognized as a concept of organized thinking, and there was a consensus that safety accidents could be reduced only when safety culture awareness was improved (Lim et al., 2014).====However, the components determining the SMS fulfillment index of the existing SMS framework are aligned with the overall implementation perspective within the organization, which does not include detailed implementation of the implementation items and does not provide an assessment of the SMS of NAVAIDs. For example, an evaluation standard manual was prepared to quantify the non-measuring indicators of the checklist method to ensure objectivity of the assessment, as the five-step evaluation of Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMi) through the evaluation questionnaire is likely to reflect subjective factors.====Korea Airports Corporation (KAC), an airport management and operation agency, has developed a method to assess the maturity of safety management of NAVAIDs by using weighted average methods for each area of assessment of the survey for persons engaged in the field of NAVAIDs (Park, 2016). The study of NAVIADs safety assessment methods can provide useful means for ANSP safety assessment methods to identify safety levels at aviation facilities management sites and improve safety awareness. This study proposes an evaluation system to objectively evaluate the level of navigation service at each airport and to publish the evaluation results to induce safety accidents at navigation safety facilities. Providing the best navigation information to users of navigation services can create a comfortable and safe airport environment for all customers using the airport.====NAVAIDs means a facility for helping aircraft navigate by means of fixed-line communication, radio communication, satellites, lights, colors, or radio waves (KTSA, 2002). The agency managing the airport and airspace has established and operated NAVAIDs to monitor the real-time status of the aircraft operating, and to provide pilots and controllers with the necessary information for the flight so that the aircraft can operate safely. NAVAIDs, which are essential for supporting air route flight, airport access, and take-off and landing of aircraft, are installed and operated in accordance with international standards, and all domestic and foreign airports are equipped with Very Omni-directional Range (VOR), Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Instrument Landing System (ILS), Aeronautical Information service/Management (====/====), and Airport Radar System (====) to support safe operation.====NAVIADs safety maturity can be defined to the extent that ANSPs take relevant safety measures and identify the establishment of processes that are effective in reducing risk to measure whether a global aviation safety roadmap is implemented locally. To further enhance the robustness of the safety maturity tool, the measurement is based on detailed evidence, is conducted in field surveys and face-to-face interviews, and a series of additional verification activities strengthens the verification mechanism of the answer.====Safety assessment indicators should be designed to help identify a set of safety measures and processes that are effective in reducing risks for ANSPs (Licu and Grace-Kelly, 2009). This study seeks to improve ATM by developing a tool that can effectively measure the safety performance of NAVAIDs. Therefore, we would like to propose safety measures and policy directions to solve safety problems or abnormalities through the safety maturity assessment of NAVAIDs (MacLean et al., 2016).",Evaluation methodology for safety maturity in air navigation safety,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972100140X,11 November 2021,2021,Research Article,144.0

In that regard, airlines can select to expand their network to compete in existing routes that are served by other airlines or explore developing new routes in first-time served markets (FTSM). FTSM are defined as airport-pairs that have not been served by any airline in the recent short-term. FTSM are marginal markets and typically do not have airline service due to the expectations of weak demand. The challenge with developing routes in FTSM is that there is usually limited insight into success chances. In FTSM, there is typically incomplete information on (1) how to benchmark the service attributes (e.g., fare, capacity) and (2) how the market will respond to these attributes. When an airline initiates a non-stop service in FTSM, it typically expects to generate revenues by diverting existing demand from other connecting itineraries and/or stimulating new demand. Demand may also be diverted from competing itineraries that exist in adjacent airports, if any. Thus, demand stimulation can be defined as the increase in the number of Origin-Destination (OD) passengers when a non-stop service (capacity) is added between their respective airport-pair. Understanding demand stimulation in FTSM is very central for airlines’ medium- and long-term network planning applications.====There are several potential research questions related to understanding the phenomenon of air travel demand stimulation in FTSM. For example, there are several alternatives on how stimulated demand is measured: as an absolute value or a relative value with respect to any market characteristics. Different measurements of demand stimulation may generate different interpretations of this phenomenon. Also, there is no consensus definition of what is considered a new service in FTSM. Some services in FTSM are seasonal or discontinued, while others are longstanding. In addition, some applications might consider demand stimulation at the airport level, while others might consider stimulation at the city level where multiple competing airports could exist. Moreover, while the measurable variables that generally impact air travel demand are well documented in the literature (Grosche et al., 2007), more research is needed to quantify these variables' significance and interaction in FTSM. Also, there is limited information on the models designed to predict demand stimulation in FTSM and the accuracy and predictability of these models. Finally, most research on demand stimulation is limited to geographical regions (Abed et al., 2001; Bhadra, 2003; Alekseev and Seixas, 2009; Kopsch, 2012; Sivrikaya and Tunç, 2013; Valdes, 2015; and Wilken et al., 2016). Thus, it is not clear how demand stimulation could differ among regions. This paper aims to explore the phenomenon of air travel demand stimulation in FTSM, for medium- and long-term airlines’ network planning applications and possibly narrow the research gaps identified above.====We present an exploratory analysis of air travel demand stimulation by non-stop service in FTMS. Using a data sample of 5,170 records representing service entries in global FTMS from September 2015 to August 2019, we examine these market characteristics and the demand response to the newly introduced non-stop service. Four different variables are considered to represent air travel demand stimulation. These variables include Stimulated Passengers, Stimulation Multiplication Factor, Stimulation Rate, and Passengers Stimulated per Non-stop Seat. The Stimulated Passengers measures the outright value of OD demand stimulation. The Stimulation Multiplication Factor quantifies how the OD demand is stimulated with respect to its initial value. The Passengers Stimulation Rate measures the OD demand stimulation normalized by the market size and is designed to measure demand stimulation while controlling the impact of the market size. Finally, Passengers Stimulated per Non-stop Seat represents demand stimulation as the return on the deployed resources. We estimate a multiple regression model for each of these four dependent variables. The main goal is to understand (1) how the different representations of demand stimulation relate to each other and (2) how their corresponding models explain the different representations of demand stimulation.====Thus, the main objective of this research is to examine the common impact of the market characteristics on demand stimulation presented in different formats and their ability to predict demand stimulation. Unfortunately, when selecting a modeling framework for this joint task, there is usually a trade-off between the model's interpretability and prediction capability. Interpretability is typically defined as the ability to provide qualitative understanding between the input variables (i.e., market characteristics) and the response variable (i.e., demand stimulation) (Martens et al., 2011). On the other hand, predictability is the degree to which a correct prediction or forecast of a system's state can be made (Bialek et al., 2001). The predictive models that are most powerful are usually the least interpretable. Since the focus of this research is to explore demand stimulation and its main driving factors, multiple linear regressions are used. In future research, we plan to report and compare results from several Machine Learning (ML) models, such as Random Forest and XGBoost (Müller and Guido, 2016; Géron, 2019). These models are typically expected to have higher predictability.====This paper is structured as follows. The next section provides the literature review, followed by an example of demand stimulation. Section 4 explains the data collection and defines the variables that are considered in the analysis. Section 5 presents the main characteristics of the sample.

This study examines the relationship between air transport development, economic growth and inbound tourism in the CLMV countries. There is bi-directional causality between air passenger traffic and economic growth in the long run. Inbound tourism has a significant impact on air transport demand in the long run but no significant relationship exists between the two in the short run. Air transport deregulation had a positive and significant impact on traffic volumes, particularly for Cambodia. Further reforms are still needed before such an outcome can occur in Myanmar.","Improving transport connectivity is one of the major elements to increasing economic growth in a country (Zhu et al., 2019). The development of civil air transport connectivity contributes to a country's economic growth through creating jobs, promoting trade, and stimulating tourism. Air transport plays a particularly important social and economic role particularly in remote areas (International Transport Forum, 2018; Zhang et al., 2017). Its development will help countries to diversify their economies and lead to increased and sustainable growth (IATA, 2019). The open market policy adopted by Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (the CLMV countries) over the last two decades has facilitated the development of their aviation industries and attracted foreign and private investment. However, due to a lack of expertise and infrastructure, their aviation industries are lagging in comparison with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region (Asian Development Bank, 2017). Although it is acknowledged that the CLMV countries have substantial potential for growth in air passenger travel through tourism and trade (Rahman et al., 2012).====There is a large body of literature on the relationship between economic development and air transport demand: Baltaci et al. (2015) on Turkey; Seсilmis and Koс (2016) on Turkey and European Union; Abed, Abdullah and Jasimuddin (2001) on Saudi Arabia; Witt and Martin (1987) on Germany and United Kingdom; Carmona-Benítez, Nieto and Miranda (2017) on Mexico; Brida, Bukstein and Zapata-Aguirre (2016) on Italy; Hakim and Merkert (2019) on South Asia; and Todorova and Haralampiev (2020) on Bulgaria. However, none of these investigations have covered the CLMV countries. Air transport also supports international tourism. In particular, air transport policy and the presence of low-cost carriers can significantly increase international arrivals to tourism destinations (Zhang and Findlay 2014; Zhang, 2015; Alderighi and Gaggero, 2019). For a long time, the aviation industries in the CLMV countries were at a disadvantage when compared with their higher income Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) neighbours like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand etc (Rahman et al., 2012). In recent years, the total air traffic carried by the airlines of these four countries remained lower than that of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, but has caught up with that of Singapore and the Philippines, as shown in Fig. 1. The governments of the CLMV countries have realised the importance of an aviation industry to their economic development. In 2003 they established the CLMV Sub-regional Cooperation on Air Transport Group to promote people and freight movements between each other (Tan, 2013).====The CLMV countries share a similar overall history, as well as aviation industry development and economic development. However, little attention has been paid to the development of CLMV countries’ air transport sector and its contribution to their economies. The literature documenting air transport development of a group of countries which share similar economic developments is particularly rare. This paper aims to close the research gap by examining the short and long-term relationships between economic growth, inbound tourism and air transport demand in the CLMV countries. The next section will briefly introduce the economic development of these countries, followed by a review of relevant studies. Section 4 presents the methodology and data. Section 5 showcases the results and discussion.

This study conceptualises a modern communication system and draws on social media data to examine pre-COVID-19 (September to December 2019) public conversations about aviation and climate change. The analysis of >326,000 Twitter posts reveals that issue salience can be considerable at times, especially during key events such as United Nation climate summits and for users from countries such as Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, France and Spain. Topic modelling identified five key frames: economy and ","The current halt to global aviation due to the COVID-19 crisis follows a period of increased public awareness of the contribution of aviation to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The flightshame movement (Becken et al., 2021; Gőssling et al., 2020) and calls for reducing air travel by groups such as Extinction Rebellion are manifestations of wider public concerns about climate change (Pew Research Centre, 2019). Aviation emissions have contributed 3.5% to man-made climate change to date (Lee et al., 2020), and are recognised as hard-to-abate in the urgent need to reduce emissions (UNEP, 2020). Flying can be a major source of emissions in an individual's carbon budget (Peeters et al., 2019). Earlier research has examined people's willingness to address air travel emissions by travelling less often or less far (Higham et al., 2016), or offsetting emissions to mitigate one's climate impact (Becken and MacKey, 2017).====Air travel emissions are both a personal matter and a political topic. The example of the London Heathrow Airport extension (Carrington, 2020) illustrates the conflict between those who see air mobility as a key vehicle for economic prosperity, improved connectivity, and government revenue (Forsyth, 2006; International Air Transport Association [IATA], 2019), versus those who consider it an insufficiently regulated (UNEP, 2020) and inequitable source of emissions (Gössling and Humpe, 2020). More recently, personal concerns have become visible at a societal level as people openly express shame about flying (BBC News, 2019; Gössling et al., 2019), including politicians who advocate for accelerated climate action (Relman, 2019). Social media have intensified conversations about the climate impacts of flying (Becken et al., 2021). This is epitomised in the Swedish Instagram account Aningslösa Influencers (Ai, standing for Clueless Influencers), which gained traction late 2018 to expose social media influencers who were seen to act irresponsibly by excessive flying (Larsson, 2019).====The dynamic topic of aviation emissions is discussed across different channels and communities, and exchanges reflect the salience of an issue, but also shape it in a complex and iterative way. The concept of issue salience seeks to describe or understand why certain topics constitute an important “focus of thinking for some citizens while being ignored by others at the same time” (Miller et al., 2016, p. 125). The issue salience of climate change has been studied in the context of news stories (Moernaut et al., 2019), public concern (Crawley et al., 2020), and its relevance to policy action (Bromley-Trujillo and Poe, 2020). However, research on the salience of ‘aviation emissions’ in social media communications is lacking, despite an increasing trend of using big data analytics in aviation studies (Chung et al., 2020). Much of the aviation-related research using data mining of online content (including social media) to date has focused on various aspects of customer satisfaction (Sezgen et al., 2019) and service quality (Barakat et al., 2021), with topics such as climate change having been overlooked. Social media data offer potential to understand customer and stakeholder opinions on the socio-political problem of carbon emissions and mitigation initiatives, and importantly, provide a channel to engage with people in a two-way manner (Punel and Ermagun, 2018).====This research builds on previous work on issue salience in social media (e.g. Eberl et al., 2020; Larsson, 2019; Spartz et al., 2017). As one of the more popular global social media platforms, Twitter provides an opportunity to ‘listen in’ on public conversations related to climate change (Becken et al., 2021; Jang and Hart, 2015; Liu and Zhao, 2017). People share and collect information on Twitter to voice their own views and to engage in ideological debate (Ciszek, 2016). Understanding Twitter as one element of the modern communication system, where all actors (including those related to aviation) are senders and recipients of messages, we propose that it is important to understand: 1) how salient the issue of aviation is within broader Twitter conversations on the climate change topic (across time and space); 2) what particular frames emerge regarding views on aviation and climate change, and 3) whether the use of polarised language (sentiment) or ‘tagging’ peers to increase issue salience differ across frames.",Twitter conversations reveal issue salience of aviation in the broader context of climate change,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721001381,26 October 2021,2021,Research Article,147.0

In the United States (U.S.), this recognition has led to an increase in: (1) the number of airports offering air service incentive agreements, and (2) the frequency with which new agreements are initiated. Despite the recognized economic importance of air service incentives, and an identified need for a database categorizing U.S. air service incentives, no such database existed. This project fills that gap by compiling a database for all 382 U.S. commercial airports included in the Federal Aviation Administration’s 2017 Terminal Area Forecast and makes it publicly available to other researchers via an online geographic information system (GIS) tool. In this paper, we describe this new database, provide a descriptive analysis of air service incentive agreements in the U.S., and identify topics future research can investigate using our database. It is our hope that this database will serve as a foundation on which to build new research related to air service incentive programs.","Air service incentives are financial inducements offered to airlines to encourage new service to particular airports and to mitigate some of the financial risk that an airline takes when it starts service in a new market. Generally speaking, there are two sources of air service incentives: (1) airports themselves; and (2) community organizations that are interested in a region's air service scale and scope, such as state and local governments, private business or economic development councils (EDCs), and convention and visitor bureaus (CVBs). Many communities view commercial air transportation and cargo air transport as valuable assets that facilitate future economic growth by providing easy access to the community for businesses looking to expand or relocate their operations and for workers looking to relocate for new employment opportunities (Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott 2018; Green, 2007; Button et al., 2010; Mukkala and Tervo, 2013).====The types, duration, and other characteristics of incentives offered by airports (i.e., coming from airport funds) are limited by the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) policies and relevant statutes (FAA, 2010). According to the FAA, airports may offer ====, such as various airport rents, landing fees, and certain other airport facility fees, as well as ====, in the form of funds to assist in marketing new air service, subject to certain restrictions. The general principles are that airports cannot offer subsidies such as direct cash payments to carriers, and that airports may only offer incentives that are limited in duration.====These airport incentives are now quite common in the U.S., with a majority of airports offering fee waivers, marketing assistance, or both. In some ways, this widespread use means that these types of incentives are a cost of doing business for an airport, or “the price of admission” for new scheduled service that airlines can expect. That said, there remains some significant variation across airports in amount, structure, and duration for these incentives.====With so many airports offering fee waivers and marketing assistance, community-sponsored incentives have become increasingly significant as a potential differentiator among airports and their air service incentive programs, even though the airports themselves are not providing the differentiating incentives. These community incentives take many forms and are not subject to FAA restrictions as long as they are not directed, determined, or funded by the airport. Perhaps due to greater freedom in designing incentives, communities tend to be the source of innovative air service incentive programs. For example, Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Montana offers a variety of community-led incentives, including marketing incentives funded by a combination of a Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP) grant and money contributed by several CVBs and ski resorts, revenue guarantees funded by ski resorts and the chamber of commerce, and a travel bank with ticket purchase pledges from a local foundation. Community incentives can be sponsored by state governments; local governments (in cases where an airport is part of the local government, only so long as the community incentives funding source is separate from airport funds); chambers of commerce; EDCs; CVBs; and other business or governmental organizations. A sampling of the types of air service incentives are identified in Table 1.====Unlike airport-funded incentives, community incentives can be direct subsidies to airlines, and they are not required to be time-limited. These incentives can come in many forms, including ====, ====, ====, ====, or ====, among others. Of these, MRGs and marketing assistance tend to be the most common forms of community incentives among the airports and communities studied. At small hub and non-hub airports, these types of incentives can be partially funded using SCASDP grants awarded annually by the U.S. Department of Transportation (Wittman, 2014).====Although new air service routes are viewed as an important driver of local and regional economic growth by some communities, no common source of information on air service incentives in the U.S. exists for researchers’ use to analyze how these incentives impact the economy or have changed over time. Some researchers have proposed theoretical models to examine the impacts of airfare subsides and incentives (e.g., see Álvarez-Albelo et al. (2020), Niemeier (2021)). Others have compiled case studies and limited databases on U.S. air incentives for analysis (Martin et al., 2009; Wittman, 2014; Ryerson, 2016a, 2016b). Additionally, Malina et al. (2012) assessed the use of incentives by the 200 largest EU airports. Taking inspiration from more robust databases on European incentives, this project fills the gap in U.S. research by compiling such a database and providing a snapshot view of air service incentives currently in use by all U.S. airports. The goal is for researchers to be able to use this publicly available database for a variety of research topics related to air service incentives.====The balance of this paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the online GIS database we assembled of air service incentive programs in use at U.S. airports. Next, we offer a descriptive analysis of the types of these air service incentive programs and characteristics of these programs that may be helpful to researchers.

To reduce the spread of the virus, countries around the world have introduced substantial lockdown measures that have included suspensions of national and international travel. The aviation industry has been hit particularly hard by these lockdowns. The fall in demand for air travel has forced many airlines to massively reduce flights and to ground most of their fleets. Within less than three weeks, airlines went from flying an all-time-high number of passengers to a sudden (and almost complete) stop that has put them under severe financial distress and looks set to trigger reforms that could fundamentally transform the sector (Amankwah-Amoah, 2020; Curley et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Beside the lockdown restrictions, the air transport industry also faces a deep economic crisis that is much stronger than past events such as the Gulf Wars, 9/11, the SARS pandemic and the global financial crisis (Gudmundsson et al., 2021). Although the aviation industry has recovered from all these previous shocks, the impact of the current pandemic on the levels of global air traffic is much greater than in any of the previous crises.====Looking ahead, numerous stakeholders are trying to understand how quickly the industry will recover from one of the worst crises it has ever experienced. Policymakers, regulators, airlines and investors need to appraise the value of strategic assets (e.g. airlines, airports, connectivity on specific routes), plan investments, seek finance, determine capacity, and decide whether to request and/or approve state aid. They need to have a better understanding of when and how a recovery is likely to take place. However, forecasting passenger demand after the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging. Future travel decisions will depend on a number of different factors ranging from supply shifts (such as progress in controlling the pandemic, government decisions to remove lockdown policies and social distancing measures that will affect the number of available seats), demand shocks (such as changes in income and potentially profound shifts in underlying customer travel preferences) and impacts which are a mixture of both (such as changes to market structure due to the potential failure or restructuring of some airlines, and changes to the strategies of authorities, airlines, and airports). We are therefore in uncharted territory where forecasts will need to draw on a range of different disciplines including infection modelling and macro and micro-modelling of the demand and supply sides of the market – as well as the techniques that are more conventionally used to forecast demand due to changes in income.====Our paper contributes to the literature on these more conventional techniques by providing additional evidence on the relationship between air transport demand and economic growth from the major business cycle fluctuations that the industry experienced in the past. Although there are some empirical studies that show how the COVID-19 pandemic might have changed travellers' preferences (see for example Zhang et al. (2021), Abdullah et al. (2020) and Song and Choi (2020)), the literature in this area is still developing and has yet to reach a consensus. Truong (2021) develops a neural network structure to predict air travel during and post COVID-19 by focusing on the correlation rather than causality between air transport demand and various novel variables such as the number of daily trips with medium and long distances to capture the likelihood of choosing air travel in addition to the Weekly Economic Index (i.e. a measure of real economic activity) and COVID-19 variables such as new tests, new cases, new hospitalisations, and new deaths, and travel restrictions. He finds that air transport demand is more sensitive to the change in economic activities while controlling for other factors measuring passengers' willingness to travel by air and the evolution of COVID-19. Our paper therefore focusses on an issue that needs to be explored in parallel with the question of potential changes in the underlying demand (e.g. potential changes in people's propensity to travel) and supply (e.g. restoration of capacity following vaccine rollout). In short, we consider how the use of long-run and short-run state-dependent income elasticities can improve upon existing air traffic forecasting models.====We revisit the relationship between air transport and income, and we provide an approach to demand forecasting based on income elasticity of demand (YED, herein), which we estimate over different time horizons and at different points of the business cycle.====YED is widely used in the aviation industry to forecast air travel demand, with forecasts being generated by applying elasticities to expected future changes in income (ICAO, 2006; Gorsche et al., 2007; Alekseev and Seixas, 2009; UK Department for Transport, 2013). However, it is important to understand clearly whether and the extent to which the relationship between economic growth and air transport is causal (in either or both directions) to avoid any spurious correlation in the forecasts and which will affect the accuracy of these forecasts (Fernandes and Pacheco, 2010).====Following Chi and Baek (2013), and Kripfganz, and Schneider (2018), we use a standard Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model with a bounds testing approach to test the causal relationship between air transport and economic growth and its direction, and identify short-run and long-run income elasticities of demand for air transport.==== Short-run elasticities capture the change in demand for air travel following a temporary shock in income, while long-run elasticities capture the change in demand after a more permanent income shock.====We estimate short-run and long-run elasticities using World Bank data on passengers and real GDP for the US. We find that income elasticities of demand are lower in the long run than in the short run. This implies that demand for air travel increases more after temporary changes in income than after more permanent changes. There are a number of potential reasons for this, including how markets mature over time and how an increase in demand (brought about by an increase in income) might also trigger an increase in supply (i.e. higher capacity and probably also more competition in the market) which could result in lower prices. As the real price of air travel (and potentially also the share of income spent on spent on it) declines, air travel could become less of a “luxury” good.==== We estimate the long run elasticity is approximately equal to 1. We also find that the short run elasticities are equal to 1.6 in normal times and during economic downturns, but get depressed to 0.1 during recovery periods. This result is consistent with the phenomenon of “precautionary saving”, whereby consumers respond to lower growth and the uncertainty of a crisis by changing their preferences and saving more.====We also compare the results of using these state-dependent elasticities with demand forecasts resulting from models relying on constant elasticities. We find that the use of our state-dependent income elasticities increases forecasting precision by 10% (measured by comparing root mean squared errors from in-sample forecasts following the Global Financial Crisis).====We then apply our state-dependent elasticities to a future change in GDP using a future scenario based on International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts. Ultimately it will be necessary to fuse our framework of estimating state-dependent income elasticity of demand with other factors to capture potential changes in demand (e.g. people's propensity to travel given the success of remote working) and supply (e.g. travel restrictions, restoration of capacity following successful vaccine rollout). We note, however, that IMF forecasts include (at a high level) projections on the easing of travel restrictions that are likely to accompany successful vaccine rollout. A successful roll out of the vaccine and its efficacy against other variants will, of course, be fundamental for the recovery of the airline industry as shown by Dube et al. (2021), because demand for air transport will rise and because travelling restrictions will be lifted.====This illustrative exercise suggests that the use of state dependent income elasticities will be better able to predict the recovery in air travel caused by a recession in the economy and that, holding other elements of the demand and supply response constant, demand for air travel is likely to recover to its 2019 level in 2025, which is three years behind the recovery of GDP following the economic recession due to the COVID-19. In other words that, ====, demand is likely to recover considerably slower than GDP and also slower than would be forecasted through the use of constant income elasticities.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides a brief literature review and some preliminary analysis that introduce our main hypotheses; section 3 describes the data used in the analysis; section 4 describes the empirical model adopted; section 5 describes our estimation results; section 6 describes our scenarios and forecasts; and section 7 concludes.

In general, flight schedules are set below the capacity level but often exceed it. The main reason for demand exceeding capacity is diminished runway capacity due to inclement weather. Alternatively, any influence from other airports can increase demand for take-off/landing, which may exceed capacity. When airport demand reaches the airport’s capacity, severe airline delays occur (Gilbo, 1997) because flights that have not been processed at the scheduled time are pushed to the queue, causing the subsequent flights to be queued.====Delays associated with increased demand and capacity interactions will rise from 1.2 min/flight in 2016 to 6.3 min/flight in 2040, transforming them from a minor to a major contributor of the total delay (Eurocontrol, 2018). This trend leads to the need for the airport capacity prediction. If we predict capacity changes in advance, the departure and arrival pace can be adjusted to reduce delays and minimize the number of flights waiting in the queue. The applicability of the airport capacity prediction is not limited to here; many of advanced traffic management models, such as air traffic management (ATM), use airport capacity as input (Cheng et al., 2003), which is typically a predictive value. Therefore, accurate airport capacity forecasting is also crucial for air traffic management.====However, an airport’s capacity is difficult to predict accurately because it is determined by numerous interconnected factors, such as operational standards, runway configuration, meteorological conditions, and air traffic demand (Kicinger et al., 2016). To accurately estimate airport capacity, it is therefore advisable to choose the method that takes the characteristics of the problem into account. The following paragraphs describe the characteristics of the airport capacity prediction problem.====The first characteristic is that the airport capacity data has a daily pattern. Fig. 1 shows the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) arrival capacity between January 4th, 2009 and January 10th, 2009. Usually, an airport operation capacity is contingent on demand. Since passengers do not like to fly too early or too late, the capacity is peaked in the afternoon and very low in the early morning and late at night. This trend forms daily patterns that time series analysis helps predict. The analysis would use information on the current capacity to estimate the capacity at the next time step.====The second characteristic is nonlinearity. Generally, airport capacity is expressed as a pair: departure capacity and arrival capacity (Kicinger et al., 2016).  Their relation is nonlinear, as airport facilities such as runways must be appropriately allocated on departure and arrival. This nonlinear relationship is characterized by three or more cases that determine how to allocate runways (e.g. departure priority mode, arrival priority mode, and balanced departure/arrival mode). Some busy airports such as ATL, EWR, or JFK, operate in an arrival or departure priority mode, making prediction more difficult.====The last thing to consider is that the capacity of an airport depends on the weather.  Whether a flight operates under either visual flight rules (VFR) or instrumental flight rules (IFR) is determined by meteorological conditions. When the weather is bad, flights follow IFR, which tighten restrictions on takeoff and landing due to insufficient visibility. The separation distance and avoidance procedures under IFR conditions reduce the capacity of the airport. While there are airports whose capacity is strongly affected by weather, some airports are not. For airports heavily influenced by weather, there is a big difference in their capacity between visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).====In consideration of the above characteristics, this paper proposes an artificial neural networks approach to predict the hourly capacity of an airport. It can learn nonlinear functions using a multilayered structure and be used for time series prediction. Another favorable factor is a recent improvement in the availability of airport-related data. Artificial neural network models will be able to better analyze the air traffic flow as their analytics capability is enhanced by more data.====In this paper, multilayer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models are trained using historical capacity and weather data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to estimate airport capacity by applying artificial neural networks. The models’ predictive performance is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, the proposed model is proved to be practical in that a single model can be applied to another airport.====This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, previous studies on airport capacity prediction problems are reviewed, and Section 3 provides a brief explanation of the artificial neural network methodologies used in this study. Section 4 explains the experimental setting s and discusses the results.

Digital transformation (DT) is both overwhelming and inevitable in a highly competitive market that shifts towards a digital ecosystem. This digitalized ecosystem is based on digital customer experience, personalization, interaction with digital channels and platforms, customer experience, and willingness to respond. This is true even for those that are born digitally (Forbes Insight, 2017). Emerging technologies have influenced both people and companies, and this transformation has become the new norm, further fueled by wider internet access and the use of mobile devices. Digital experience has become a focus more than ever for the business world, as well as the people. This is also true for the airline industry, which has become a global playground for the DT (Büyüközkan et al., 2020a, b; Büyüközkan et al., 2021a). Air transportation not only provides both employment and earnings but also acts as the backbone for mobility and supply chains. In the past, the focus for airlines used to be operational efficiency, competitive margins, regulatory compliance, and environmental footprint. This is changing. Nowadays, digital technologies and the DT offer far more opportunities to create new value and deliver differentiated customer experience and loyalty, which are critical goals for airlines (Accenture, 2016). DT can be operationalized in terms of enhanced connectivity, evolving airline distribution, robots, digital twins, artificial intelligence (WNS, 2020), smart automation, digital trust, agile and flexible workforce, and digital platforms, all of which are disruptive technologies for the airline industry (Accenture, 2016). New passenger trends are based on the increased usage of multiple devices, social media platforms, and online channels used for searching, booking, ticketing, and tracking, thus offering advantages, such as cost efficiency, enhanced customer experience and time savings. New digital ecosystems also imply new threats to businesses, forcing organizations to review their business models and to convert DT into a competitive advantage to be sustainable and profitable.====Digital innovation must be well managed by airline companies. The use of DT improves management capabilities in terms of inventory, dynamic pricing, sales channels, marketing, and business areas. Not the technology but the strategy drives the DT (Kane et al., 2015). Therefore, airline companies should be capable of analyzing their internal and external environments well and implement the right strategies at the right time in the right place. This is only possible with a holistic strategy (Borgogna et al., 2016). From this point of view, DT strategies (DTSs) are determined using a SWOT analysis in this study. A case study is conducted in the Turkish airline industry to validate the DTSs.====SWOT analysis is one of the strategic management tools that was explained by Albert Humphrey in 1960. It helps to reveal different strategies for decision-makers and practitioners. However, SWOT analysis can be insufficient in determining the importance degrees of the SWOT criteria and possible alternative strategies. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods can be helpful to eliminate such an inadequacy (Büyüközkan et al., 2021b). MCDM is a powerful and widely used tool to evaluate many conflicting criteria for decision problems at hand. For this reason, MCDM methods are integrated with SWOT analysis in this study. The AHP technique (Saaty, 1980), which is one of the popular MCDM methods for solving decision-making problems concerning the airline industry (Mardani et al., 2015) is used to determine the weights and importance degrees of the SWOT criteria. Following that, a recently proposed MCDM technique, Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) (Stević et al., 2020), is utilized for determining the importance degrees of the revealed DTSs and for selecting the most appropriate DTS. Real-life problems are complex and decision-making during problem-solving includes human perception and uncertainty. Hence, the proposed SWOT-based AHP-MARCOS methodology is expanded to a fuzzy environment by using fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965) to eliminate inherent uncertainties of human judgment. Results are compared with fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy VIKOR methods to validate the proposed integrated SWOT-based fuzzy AHP and fuzzy MARCOS methodology.====The study contributes to the state of the art by proposing a novel integrated SWOT-based fuzzy AHP - fuzzy MARCOS method for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and investigating its advantages on a case study in the Turkey aviation industry. The study also defines new appropriate DTSs with the help of a SWOT analysis for airline companies in Turkey.====The study includes the following sections: Section 2 explains SWOT analysis and the proposed methodology.

In particular, the contemporaneous response of each of the twelve stock prices is negative and significantly different from zero. Furthermore, for most of the airline stock returns, this decline is persistent, lasting well beyond two weeks after the initial COVID-19 shock.

This has ensued in human factors, particularly trust becoming an essential point of consideration in Air Traffic Controller (ATCO)-automation teams. An undertaking to better embody trust behaviours in ATCOs was attempted by coalescing two schools of thought on trust using the principles of superposition and complementarity from ====. This model was further refined with behavioural indicators from the experiment. Brain imaging verification of this synchronised coexistence of both philosophies was established with the use of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, where ATCOs were given conflict detection tasks with the aid of ATS-CAP software that was able to generate credible flight plans with visible waypoints and airports. Data from self-reported questionnaires have been useful in building generalised models of trust. However, the robustness of the model that has been proposed in this paper is higher than generalised models because of the utilisation of unbiased data to represent specifically ATCO trusting behaviour under uncertainty. This is an improvement on current models that are also context-dependent and based on subjective data.","The expected steady growth of air traffic worldwide has indubitably been tempered by the recent COVID-19 crisis. However, the resurrection of air traffic is expected to take between 2 and 6 years (Gudmundsson et al., 2021). As such, the Air Traffic Management (ATM) community has been constantly exploring novel strategies of improving ATM infrastructure, to manage the steadily rising air traffic levels, while preserving operational capacity and safety goals. One of the most crucial enablers envisaged by Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) in its master plan, is the enhanced automation support of Air Traffic Control Systems. However, Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) have at times utilised automation tools in a manner that diverges from the designers’ intended use, with ATCOs trusting their own proficiency than that of an automation tool (van de Merwe et al., 2012). Amongst the prospective ideas highlighted by SESAR in their pipeline to assist future ATCOs was that of a “Digital Ground Assistant”. The fundamental task given to any ATCO is to ensure and maintain separation between all aircraft in their area of responsibility. One of the most significant features in accomplishing this task is that of conflict detection and resolution. As such, this should comprise the principal task of this “Digital Ground Assistant”, which is only one of a variety of tools put forward by SESAR. Nonetheless, despite the efficacy of any automation aid that is deployed, human-automation trust, which denotes appropriate use of an automation tool based on its execution of tasks, needs to be calibrated as it is vital to prevent disuse by ATCOs (Parasuraman and Riley, 1997).====Detailed human-automation trust studies in the past have adopted a broader definition of trust that assimilated notions of autonomy in the automation tool (Goillau et al., 2003), and acknowledged the multidimensionality of trust (Jian et al., 2000). However, they depended upon the self-reports from questionnaires of ATCOs and university students respectively. While surveys are particularly useful when data from a large participant pool is required, or when a study warrants the collection of generalised data (Rowley, 2014), they also have inherent limitations, which include an implicit manifestation of researcher bias in the way the questions are expressed, equivocality in the phrasing of questions that result in inaccurate interpretations, and complications involving the expression of intricate concepts (Demetriou et al., 2014). Moreover, subject perception of trust and distrust being inversely related to each other (Goillau et al., 2003; Jian et al., 2000) may not be reflective of whether that is indeed the case at a fundamental level.====There is an apparent call for impartial data to be used in the defining of the nature of human-automation trust, especially when considering the relationship between trust and distrust, as well as its related dimensions. Questionnaires have proven to be useful in identifying the elements that affect trust and ATCO use of automation tools. However, the mechanisms and antecedents of trust have not been elucidated yet. Trust has in fact been one of the human factors that have been least explored ATM even though it has a large multifaceted effect on ATCO interaction with automation aids (Langan-Fox et al., 2009). The solution to explicating the roots of human behaviour could be found in neuroergonomics, which as the name suggests, is the combination of two adjoining areas in research: Neuroscience and Ergonomics. This is the next logical phase for human factors research in the field of Air Traffic Management (ATM); to augment previous findings of ergonomics studies, and to acquire brand new insights, by using techniques established in neuroscience, with trust being no exception (Parasuraman, 2003). Neuroergonomics, and particularly neuroimaging, offers the ability to deliver insight into the neural basis for trust, and hence, the tantalising prospect of tackling trust-related problems at the very root becomes more realistic.====The chosen framework of analysis, and the subsequent model of trust yielded, was inspired by quantum theory in physics, where the superposition of two incompatible states occurs under uncertainty. The merit of this framework lies in its simultaneous consideration of trust and distrust by combining them together, instead of a dispersed analysis method, while ATCOs conduct their tasks using their automation aids. This setting is particularly suitable for human-automation trust in ATCOs, due to their occupation consistently necessitating making crucial judgements in tandem with their automation tools in a dynamic environment with an implicit time limit on every such decision. Some principles of quantum theory are applied in the process of contemplating both distrust and trust simultaneously. It is imperative to highlight at this stage, that the proposed model is not entirely a quantum system. It is one that incorporates several quantum properties that are pertinent to human-automation trust in ATCOs.====A novel model of trust is required due to the fact that present models of trust have been unable to represent this critical human factor comprehensively or robustly enough (Langan-Fox et al., 2009). A quantum-based paradigm could possibly provide the ideal solution to resolve this predicament. Furthermore, previous cognitive models have been based on classical probability theory, which innately deems them somewhat limited because they are deterministic. Human behaviour does not always adhere to these models, particularly in a complex and dynamic environment that ATCOs encounter in every shift. Under uncertainty, these conventional models have been unable to fully account for the subsequent ATCO conduct since decisions made by them with limited time in a complex environment tend to be more heuristic than entirely rational. The difference between these cognition states will be explained in Section 2.2.====Quantum cognition models that overlay two or more incompatible mental states may possibly take into consideration this uncertainty (Wang et al., 2013), thus deriving a far more accurate representation of human-automation trust, and the final acceptance decision in operational situations. In the context of this study, the starting point was obtaining the post-experimental acceptance data, which was the behavioural indicator of trust. While acceptance cannot be equated to trust, with both being distinctive, trust was indeed found to have a significant influence on acceptance (Molnar et al., 2018). As such, it functioned as a satisfactory starting reference point in this study. The acceptance data was then compared to brain activity in brain regions traditionally associated with trust and distrust, and subsequently analysed through a quantum perspective to present a more complete and enhanced prototype of human-automation trust. This paper intends on offering a basis upon which a quantum cognition model could be built to enhance the comprehension of human-automation trust in ATM, as shown on Fig. 1.",A quantum-inspired model for human-automation trust in air traffic controllers derived from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and correlated with behavioural indicators,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721001253,15 September 2021,2021,Research Article,163.0

These crises to a great extent affect air travelers' motivation, which in turn affects the air travel demand that justifies airlines' legitimate existence and sustainability. However, there has been relatively little research into understanding air travelers' motivation during and after such crises, despite some studies having been conducted in the tourism domain to understand the motivation of tourists to travel to specific destinations. An enhanced knowledge in this field is important and would benefit the airline industry, which is facing increasing competition from other transportation modes as well online conferencing technologies. By applying the Push and Pull Factor model, this study has sought to identify the travel motivation and further determine whether Push factors have any positive influence on Pull factors. To this end, 760 questionnaires were collected from Taiwan. Both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. Our findings reveal that the Destination image remains the most influential Pull factor, while Aviation-specific products and services is the least attractive Pull factor. Self-realization/achievement topped the rankings for the Push factors, while Flying experience was a selling point in its own right among the Push factors, although it was not as appealing as anticipated. The millennium generation, fewer frequent flyers and low-income consumers are more likely to take advantage of flying deals. This paper suggests that a more collaborative approach between airlines, airports and destination organizations could be adopted to design and promote tailor-made aviation and travel products to stimulate segmented consumers’ demand for air travel during crises. Effective marketing strategies need to be in place to promote the specially-designed travel products.","The airline ==== has experienced exponential growth since deregulation in the late 1970s, despite the growth rates varying from country to country. Such growth, however, has been accompanied by crises and disastrous events, instances of which include but are not limited to political instability, terrorist threats and attacks, economic recessions, natural disasters, and pandemics such as COVID-19. Crises in the airline industry also include fatal aircraft incidents and accidents resulting in casualties that have tarnished the reputation of carriers.====The impacts of these crises on the industry are threefold. Air travelers have been able to adjust their travel behavior by adapting to new operational routines, such as going through more rigid security procedures, or choosing to alter their travel plans (====). They have also been able to choose an alternative transportation mode, such as driving a vehicle (====), or taking the high-speed rail where accessible, or sometimes abandoning air travel completely. Service providers, such as airlines, airports, and aircraft manufacturers, have experienced significant challenges in their recovery endeavors following the crises, due to various contributing factors including a negative impact on the brand, weak demand, and a decrease in the travelers’ confidence in the carrier and the aircraft (====). To survive, they have been compelled to adjust their business models, introduce new and improve existing operational procedures, and invest in new technologies (====), with an ultimate goal being to reduce cost, enhance productivity and improve their competitiveness to satisfy travelers needs and retain their loyalty. Governments, which have relaxed their economic control over airline operations through liberalization (====), even though the level of control varies from country to country, appear to have re-emerged with an intervening hand in the airlines both during and after the crises. The interventionist measures have taken various formats, including direct cash injections (====), stimulus packages for flight subsidies (====).====The impact of COVID-19, the global pandemic, on the global airline industry and economy has been unprecedented (====). Travelers are reluctant to board a flight, due to both imposed travel bans by individual governments as well as their concerns about virus transmission throughout the journey (====). Air travelers' confidence has dropped to a historical low, with 40 percent of respondents in IATA's survey indicating that they would wait for 6 months or longer before considering air travel (====). Consumers have also joyfully experienced using virtual communication platforms, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, which boast of their ability to remove the necessity of air travel for business purposes (====).====During the pandemic, more than 80 percent of the global airline capacity has been suspended, more than 18,000 aircraft have been parked, and hundreds of thousands of workers have been laid off (====). Airlines are on the edge of bankruptcy, and have been calling for financial aid and a coordinated approach to supporting the recovery of the sector (====). A handful of airlines, however, have aptly launched marketing campaigns in order to continue to stimulate travel demand and satisfy their zest for flying during the crisis. For example, an innovative idea of having “fly-nowhere” flights was designed and introduced by Qantas, which departed and landed at the same airport after cruising in the domestic airspace for several hours to make possible a spectacular sightseeing and flying experience (====). The response from the public was unexpected with the tickets being sold out in 8 minutes. Domestic and off-island air travel in markets such as Taiwan also experienced increased demand due to the effective COVID safety measures having been put in place (====). For example, Taiwan's two main domestic carriers - Mandarin Airlines affiliated to China Airlines and Eva Air's Uni Air - have added extra capacity over the summer to Taiwan's sun-soaked offshore islands and rugged east coast (====). The Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands have become the hottest air travel destinations, which were hardly considered in non-crisis circumstances (====), with the factor load being as high as over 90 percent (====).====At the same time, national governments have provided support to the airline industry in various forms, with a view to ensuring essential connectivity during the pandemic and protecting millions of jobs that the industry supports (====). As of August 2020, governments or government-backed entities across 57 countries had offered approximately US$159 billion in relief measures to the global airline industry (====), which was 38% of the total projected revenue loss for airlines of US$419 billion in 2020 (====). A few examples included the provision of subsidies to aviation and tourism businesses by Australia's federal government (====), a travel voucher scheme by Australia's Victoria state government (====), and the Triple Stimulus Voucher Scheme by the Taiwan authority (====). The common purpose was to encourage public spending to stimulate economic activities including air travel.====These phenomena raise some interesting questions: Why are some travelers motivated to fly in spite of the crises? What are the factors that motivate air travelers to fly during crises? Are those factors associated with marketing campaigns or stimulus packages, or do the travelers have an inherent desire to fly?====Travel motivation, including travel motivation during and after a crisis, have received increasing attention recently in attempts to understand the considerations of travelers who make individualized decisions regarding travel. Several theoretical models have also been developed to either identify and depict the factors or establish any associations between personality and travel motivation. The findings of incumbent research are also mixed, with some suggesting that crises and disasters would only defer the travelers’ intention temporarily, while others observe a resilient travel intention (====). Nevertheless, the existence of a disparity between intentions and actual behavior has been established (====), which requires further investigation (====).====A thorough understanding of air travel motivation is important, particularly for the travel industry. It will allow businesses to make better-informed decisions on product and service development and to engage in richer interactions leading to long-term customer loyalty (====). An improved understanding of air travel motivation during and after a pandemic is even more important, as it will help businesses with the strategic planning to weather such crises.====This paper intends to address this knowledge gap. Using quantitative data collected from Taiwan, it aims to identify external and internal factors affecting consumers' air travel motivation during and after crises, especially in relation to COVID-19, and to determine which factors might be more influential than the others. It further attempts to establish whether external stimuli have any influence on the travelers’ internal desires. This paper is structured as follows. Section ==== provides a critical review of the literature on travel motivation, its relationship with travel demand, and the underpinning theoretical model. The methodology in Section ==== outlines the research design, data collection and analysis approach, and hypothesis development. Sections ====, ==== respectively present and discuss the findings in light of the incumbent literature. The paper concludes with a theoretical contribution, the implications for the relevant industry, and acknowledges the research limitations and future research direction.====The following is the Supplementary data to this article:",Investigating air travellers’ travel motivation during a pandemic crisis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721001204,14 September 2021,2021,Research Article,164.0

Results reveal that tracking and tracing, digitalized management, air traffic management, regulatory ","Digitalization and innovations are recognized to give businesses sustainable competitiveness and enhance supply chain or organizational performance (Del Giudice et al., 2020; Wamba and Queiroz, 2020; Di Vaio et al., 2021). However, information security and information transparency are still the major issues concerned by companies when adopting new information and communication technologies (ICTs) in their operations. Attributing to blockchain technology's trust and decentralization characteristics, its adoption can real-time track information and solve traceability problems in supply chains (Ali et al., 2020; Hirata et al., 2021). Blockchain technology has changed business models and has been demonstrated to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020b; Thakur et al., 2020). Meanwhile, many scholars and technology developers characterized blockchain technology as revolutionary and disruptive, transforming traditional, well-accepted centralized management into disintermediate decentralization operations. It has been attracting many scholars' attention since its first introduction by Nakamoto (2008). Blockchain can be defined as “====.”==== The definitions reveal some characteristics of blockchain: disintermediation, capability to timestamp data, permanence, immutability, and integrity (Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020a; Lopes et al., 2021).====Due to its unique attributes, blockchain can make contributions in numerous aspects. First, blockchain can enhance trust between cooperation partners because of its capability to eliminate concerns on the reliability of intermediaries. Also, blockchain can increase the visibility of supply chains by tracking real-time status of cargo accessible to all authorized parties (Hughes et al., 2019; Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020a). Second, blockchain can streamline business processes, boost efficiency, and reduce transaction costs through automation and reduction in paperwork handling (Zhou et al., 2020). Third, the decentralization of blockchain and network-based authentication make data stored in blockchain difficult to falsify. Data integrity can increase the security of transactions (Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020). Further, blockchain could contribute to the realization of SDGs by promoting new business model establishment and improving business resilience (Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020b; Del Giudice et al., 2021).====Despite the promising benefits of blockchain, academic research on blockchain in aviation is far from mature; existing academic papers linking blockchain to aviation are scarce. Additionally, most research has focused on the technical design of blockchain, such as traffic management (Clementi et al., 2019) and cybersecurity frameworks (Adhikari and Davis, 2020). Moreover, some scholars have investigated potential challenges (Lopes et al., 2021). Nevertheless, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no existing research has focused on the determinants of blockchain adoption by the aviation industry and empirically analyzed promising applications and critical challenges from the perspectives of aviation participants and academic researchers. This research topic is essential because an improved understanding of blockchain adoption enablers could effectively promote digitalization in the aviation industry. Thus, this study examines the factors influencing the aviation industry's intention to adopt blockchain technologies from perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Moreover, this study provides some actionable insights into the ways blockchain technology could be applied and improved based on the aviation industry's demands and collects empirical data that could help air logistics participants in their decision-making processes.====The research questions are as follows: (1) What important applications could contribute to the perceived usefulness of blockchain adoption? (2) What essential improvements are required to smoothen and ease the process of adopting blockchain? (3) How do perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of blockchain foster the intention to consider adopting blockchain from aviation participants' perspectives? To answer these research questions, first, this study conducted literature review to identify potential blockchain applications and future improvements in air logistics. Questionnaire items will be selected from reliable academic papers and reports and modified according to experts' opinions. The technology acceptance model (TAM) will be used to assess factors that influence the intention to use blockchain technology from the following two dimensions: blockchain applications and future improvement.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review of the TAM and blockchain technology in logistics, supply chain, and aviation. Research hypotheses are put forward here. Section 3 introduces the survey design.

Therefore, to improve public health and mitigate the risk of infection brought by international air travel, appropriate travel policies are necessary to address these challenges (====).====While China has successfully controlled COVID-19 domestically and prevented imported cases in March 2020 due to the implementation of stringent preventive and restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, strict requirements on mask-wearing, flight rerouting, and reductions in air service, the pandemic is likely to continue into the foreseeable future since global herd immunity and widespread vaccination has not yet established. In order to develop sound mid- and long-term strategies for the ==== to gradually restore global air service while maintaining the safety of international travel, the China aviation authority has implemented a series of new interventional strategies since June 2020.==== Shortly after, on July 20, 2020, CAAC, together with the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), jointly issued a new policy that required all international passengers (including both foreign visitors and returning Chinese citizens) to present negative COVID-19 Nucleic Acid test results (hereinafter referred to as ""negative NAT"") before boarding flights to China. The required negative NAT must be conducted within five days of embarkation at facilities designated or recognized by Chinese embassies in host countries (====). In order to further reduce cross-border transmission of COVID-19, a more stringent policy known as the “double negative tests” was implemented on November 7, 2020. This policy requires all Chinese and foreign passengers flying to China to take both nucleic acid, IgM anti-body tests and apply for green health codes or certified health declaration forms within 48 hours before boarding the flight.==== While these policies have been widely reported and discussed, it remains unclear to what extent these response strategies are effective in terms of curbing the imported COVID-19 risk. In addition, although there is an increasing amount of literature that have attempted to examing the influence of COVID-19 on the aviation demand and risk performance (====; ====; ====), there is still a lack of empirical understanding on the performance and dynamics of various implemented countermeasure strategies.====The objective of this study is to provide an empirical assessment of the effectiveness of the three aviation policies on the containment of imported SARS-CoV-2 positive carriers.

Therefore, identifying contributing factors and understanding the effect of these factors in causing the variation of air travel demand have been one of the key focus areas in air transportation research. This article reviews 87 air travel demand studies published from 2010 to 2020 and summarizes these studies using their input data and primary analytical methods. We also devise and conduct three citation analyses to further explore the relationships among the reviewed studies. Our review finds that a typical empirical study of air travel demand analysis would focus on the demand at the national level, employ time-series data concerning socio-economic and airline operational factors and use time-series based methods to estimate the relationship among the selected time-series. These studies are mostly applying existing analytical frameworks to specific problems rather than developing original methods, therefore their relationship to each other is parallel rather than sequential. A small number of references are frequently cited by the reviewed studies primarily because of their methodological contribution to time-series analysis. A common limitation of existing literature is that very few reviewed studies provide validation of their analyses. In addition, methods that are not regression or time-series based have very limited application in this area so far, so are the non-convention data such as mobility data or social media data. Besides providing a systematic summary of recent publications in a specific field, this review uses a relatively objective and replicable framework to compare and link studies by their references, which can be visualized by the figures included in this review. This review is expected to benefit future researchers that are interested in either air transportation or the application of time-series forecasting in an applied domain.","Accurate forecasting of air travel demand plays a critical role in the resource planning of the air transportation industry. For airlines, air travel demand directly affects flight scheduling, revenue management, marketing, and rostering in the short term and fleet planning, manpower planning, resource allocation, and network planning in the long term. For airport operators, the estimation of future air travel demand is the basis of producing an airport master plan, thus guiding the airport development and capitalization of major infrastructure projects. For policymakers, the demand for air travel is one of the benchmarks while setting the budget for air transportation and its associated sectors. For the aerospace industry, the future demand is the conducting baton that directs the development and manufacturing of aircraft, engines, components, and parts. Also, for communities, the accuracy of air travel demand largely estimates affects the access of local residents to the air transportation network.====Air travel demand forecasting is one of the most thoroughly addressed topics in air transportation research. A typical study concerning the air travel demand of either a nation or a region normally starts by first selecting a few relevant quantifiable factors as predictor variables. These variables are selected based on relevance established by previous studies and data availability. Due to the naturally longitudinal nature of forecasting studies, data of these variables are often time-series in format. Researchers then resort to econometrics or statistics-based analytical models to investigate the effects of predictor variables on air travel demand.====Because of the large volume of literature in this area, systematic reviews of relevant studies become both meaningful and necessary. There have been several significant efforts over the past decades reviewing and summarizing the progress of air travel demand studies. In the broad tourism sector, Crouch (1994) reviews 85 studies regarding international tourism demand. This review summarizes both the demand determinants and findings of the reviewed articles. Witt and Witt (1995) evaluate the forecasting performance of qualitative and quantitative methods used by 42 studies concerning tourism demand forecasting based on the error magnitude of forecasting models, the accuracy of forecasting the changes in demand of next year, and the ability of forecasting potential turning point in the future demand trend. The review concludes that the naive model and autoregression outperform other methods based on the magnitude of the error. They find that exponential smoothing and econometric models work better in forecasting future changes and predicting turning points. Li (2009) reviews 180 studies addressing the tourism demand of the Greater China market. This review assesses selected publications in terms of the sampling frequency, subject regions, independent variables, dependent variables, modeling methods, and performance of forecasting methods. Goh and Law (2011) examine 155 tourism demand estimation articles published between 1995 and 2009. Their review provides an overview of the progress of forecasting methodologies and categorizes the estimation methods into three major groups, time-series, econometric, and artificial intelligence (AI) based methods. Moreover, Goh and Law (2011) suggest that studies using blended forecasting methods outperform studies using a single method. A recent review completed by Ghalehkhondabi et al. (2019) covers 118 studies published between 2007 and 2017. Similarly, the review finds that studies using mixed methods, in general, outperform those using a single method in terms of forecasting accuracy.====Within the air transportation research community, Wang and Song (2010) review 115 studies published from 1950 to 2008 and analyze several elements, including research progress, journals of publication, determinants of demand, estimation methods, and demand elasticity. Wang and Song (2010) suggest that very few studies focus on leisure air travel, and the US market has attracted more research attention than other regions. Babić et al. (2011) analyze popular models used in airline demand forecasting studies, where they compare traditional forecasting methods, such as moving averages and exponential smoothing, with new methods such as deep learning. Another review completed by Addepalli et al. (2018) focuses on assessing the impacts of socio-economic and demographic factors, which are important to help increase manufacturing productivity and maintain the air travel demand. Ballard et al. (2019) present a summary report of academic and industrial studies that use disaggregated socio-economic data to predict the variation of U.S. air travel demands.====As seen in the above summary, existing literature reviews of air travel demand studies mostly focus on summarizing and comparing predictor variables and research methods of the reviewed studies. Studies that are being reviewed are presented and analyzed in a parallel structure. Very few reviews have attempted to explore the connections among the reviewed studies. Researchers who are new to air travel demand analysis would struggle to identify the research progress in this area by reading all the aforementioned reviews. This becomes the primary motivation for conducting this literature review.====In addition to summarizing the recently published articles addressing air travel demand, this study also aims to explore the relationship among reviewed studies through various citation analyses. We use the following research questions to guide the rest of the review:====The rest of this article is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the reviewing method and the analytical framework used by this article. Section 3 explores the factors considered as forecasting inputs by the reviewed studies.

For an ANSP (Air Navigation Service Provider), to fulfill the responsibility with a high-quality service degree while maintaining safety, these difficult areas should be designed carefully and equipped with the most efficient procedures. Point merge system (PMS), which is defined as a systemized method for sequencing arrival flows, is launched in Istanbul's new TMA (LTFM TMA) being designed by DHMI (Devlet Hava Meydanları Isletmesi) to improve safety and efficiency. In this paper, the airspace complexity is based on adjusted density and structural index, and safety indicators. To investigate the effects of the radical changes made in re-organized LTFM TMA on the safety issue in comparison with the previous terminal maneuvering area, LTBA TMA, six months' data consisting of 75215 arrival and departure flights are used. Results reflect that the LTFM TMA, one of the world's busiest terminal airspaces, has statistically significantly lower scores in terms of conflict numbers per aircraft, complexity metrics, adjusted density, the hour of interactions, and flight hours than LTBA TMA.

On April 6, 2019, Istanbul Airport (LTFM) has inherited the aviation code “IST” from LTBA as a result of a big switch, which continued for a total of 45 h. In the following days, the major part of the operations has started to be served from LTFM. This big transfer was one of the most important air transport operations in aviation history.====Istanbul Airport and its deployment process are of great importance not only for Turkey but also for World ATM. “LTFM Airspace Design”, the heart of the matter in this process, was called “==== and, defined as “====” by the designers and core team in this project.====LTFM's deployment process has started in 2015 and it is planned to continue until the end of Phase 4, 2028. The construction of the LTFM airport is involving four major phases. During Phase 1a, the airport had two independent parallel runways. Istanbul Airport is expected to serve the highest number of passengers in the world after the construction completion. According to the project plan, the airport will have six runways, five independent parallel runways plus one additional east-west runway at the end of Phase 4 without compromising safety performance.

Volcanic ash refers to the fine fragments of magmatic glass shards, magmatic crystals, and other rocks (lithic material) with a diameter of below 2 mm (White and Houghton, 2006). The ingestion of airborne volcanic matter into jet turbines may cause harm by (1) abrasion of the engines' parts, (2) destabilization of the fuel/air mix and its dynamics, and (3) melting and sintering ash onto the engines' parts (Kueppers et al., 2014). The aviation industry has long encountered various challenges posed by volcanic disasters since the beginning of the commercial air transport service in the 1940s. Among them, the stalling of the aircraft's engine by volcanic ash is the most serious challenge that has caused serious accidents in the past. According to the database of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (Guffanti et al., 2010), a volcanic ash cloud arising from Mount (Mt.) Galunggung in Java stalled all the engines of the British Airways Flight 009 (Boeing 747-400) in 1982. In 1989, the eruption of Mt. Redoubt in Alaska resulted in the emergency landing of the KLM Flight 867 (Boeing 747-400). The aircraft had experienced an engine stall due to the dispersion of volcanic ash. Following these accidents, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established some guidelines to prevent the stalling of engines by volcanic ash. The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland prompted the stakeholders of air transport to implement firm measures to prevent accidents caused by volcanic ash.====The occurrence of such disasters is quite possible in other areas and particularly in East Asia, where there are many active volcanos. Recently, the eruptions of some active volcanos, such as Mt. Agung in Bali (2017) and Mt. Sinabung in Sumatra (2019), Indonesia, affected the country's air transport network. It resulted in airport shutdowns, flight cancellations, detours, and reroutings. The latest serious case was the eruption of Mt. Taal in the Philippines on January 12, 2020. This eruption caused the shutdown of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila and the cancellation of more than 500 flights.====The volcanic eruption and dispersion of a large volume of ash caused damage to air transport. Regarding aviation safety, some researchers express concerns regarding the negative impact of eruptions on Asia-based air transport. Whelley et al. (2015) identified the potential risk of volcanic eruptions in Southeast Asia, where there are 771 active volcanos. Furthermore, they classified the morphology of the volcanos to evaluate the explosivity and obtained a high probability of 1.0 in a decade for VEI4==== eruptions. The scale of the eruption diffuses volcanic ash farther than 1000 km. Research should be conducted on the potential risks of volcanic eruptions in other areas, as well.====Areas in the Far East can be considered potentially risky, particularly in Japan, which has 111 active volcanos (MLIT, 2018). Furthermore, volcanos with frequent eruptivity are concentrated in the southwestern part of Japan, Kyushu. More than 14,000 eruptions (VEI====) have occurred at Mt. Sakurajima since 1955, and their eruptive activity increased as Mt. Aso has had repeated eruptions during a period of 20 years. Whereas a VEI 3 eruption occurred in 2011 at Mt. Shinmoedake after 250 years of dormancy. As these volcanos are close to Kagoshima and Kumamoto airports, the eruptions had negative effects on the aviation sector (causing airport closures and flight cancellations). However, their negative impact on air transport is not very serious in Japan. This is because, in general, the eruptions are small, moderate, or moderate-large (VEI ==== 3), although there are risks for surface transport and land use (due to the boulder/debris flow). Nevertheless, unfortunately, the main route for the trans-Pacific air transport,==== A-1 in Fig. 1, for example, passes close to the location of these volcanos. A large eruption with VEI ==== 4, which diffuses the volcanic ash farther than 1000 km, will have serious national and transnational impacts, not only on the air routes but also on many airports in Japan. Fortunately, we have not experienced such a serious situation since the beginning of commercial aviation. However, we note that large eruptions (VEI ====4) in this area have been recorded in the past. For example, large-scale eruptions occurred at Sakurajima in 1471–1476, 1779, and 1914. Hence, we should estimate the impact of such large eruptions on the air transport network. We should also discuss how to reduce this impact by effectively managing the airport network.====Fortunately, most large eruptions are preceded by precursory phenomena, such as an increase in the seismicity of volcanic earthquakes and inflation of the mountain body. The amount of volcanic ash eruption is forecasted from the seismic energy (Iguchi et al., 2019) and ground inflation (Iguchi et al., 2013). The volume of ash allows us to forecast its dispersal and the fall of volcanic ash by simulation (e.g. PUFF model) (Tanaka and Iguchi, 2015). We can enhance the resilience of the air transportation network by transferring aircraft to safe areas before the eruption occurs. This helps minimize a large eruption's impact on the aviation sector.====Since the impacted area due to the dispersal and fall of the volcanic ash covers a considerable part of Japan's territory, the capacity of the safe airports to accommodate evacuating the aircraft is a critical concern for the feasibility of evacuation. Thus, in this study, we evaluate the available capacity of the aircraft's evacuation against a large eruption by estimating the impact of its dispersal and the fall of volcanic ash on the air traffic in Japan to contribute to strategic airport infrastructure improvements. In particular, we use the detailed air traffic information provided by Collaborative Actions for Renovation of Air Traffic System (CARATS) Open Data==== and simulate a situation based on the information regarding some historical events. Based on the simulation's results, we identify the method of aircraft evacuation best suited to the simulated conditions.====In this paper, an introduction to our research is followed by a literature review. Subsequently, we simulate an emergency air traffic situation caused by a large eruption occurring in the western part of Japan. This is based on available information about some historical events. We then discuss the eruption's impact on air transport. Finally, we summarize our research findings and identify the issues in reducing the impact of a large eruption on air transport.",Large volcanic eruptions and their influence on air transport: The case of Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721001186,19 August 2021,2021,Research Article,169.0

Enhancing productivity and efficiency became essential for airlines if they were to survive and thrive under continually increasing competitive market pressures, as evidenced by headline news such as “Increasing productivity a necessity for airlines” (Associated Press, 2005). Oum and Yu (1998) show that airlines were able to improve their profitability during the 1990s despite rising input prices and declining airfares because of their high productivity growth. Greer (2008) finds that US airlines achieved significant cost reduction through productivity improvement that enabled them to survive the tumultuous years from 2000 to 2004. Airline productivity growth is also considered a key contributor to overall economic growth. Based on the analysis of data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis, Russell (2017) showed that from 1997 to 2014, air transportation facilitated 7% of the productivity growth in the US.====Consequently, there is a large volume of literature in the field and a broad variety among studies in terms of their methodologies and topics of investigation. Earlier studies are more concentrated on issues related to the effects of regulations and deregulation on airline efficiency using traditional cost/production function estimation or index number approaches, such as the studies by Morrell and Taneja (1979), Caves et al. (1982), Caves et al. (1983), Barla and Perelman (1989), Mechling (1991), Forsyth (2001), and Oum et al. (2005). In the 1990s, the focus began to shift to the effects of liberalization in international markets; examples of such studies include Bruning (1991), Encaoua (1991), Good et al. (1993), Distexhe and Perelman (1994), Good et al. (1995), Oum and Yu (1995), Fu et al. (2010), Fu and Oum (2014), and Fu et al. (2015). Two popular approaches, i.e., data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), were adopted to analyze airline productivity and efficiency during this period. In the new millennium, many researchers turned their attention to the effects of business models and management strategies (e.g., mergers and alliances) on airline performance, e.g., Oum et al. (2004), Merkert and Morrell (2012), Yan et al. (2019). In more recent years, a growing number of studies have melded airline productivity and efficiency with environmental factors (e.g., Lee and Worthington, 2014; Scotti and Volta 2015; Lee et al., 2017; Cui and Li 2019), flight delays (e.g., Fleurquin et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017; Tsionas et al., 2017), and safety issues (e.g., Khoshkhoo et al., 2018; Rosenow and Fricke, 2019; Rosenow et al., 2019).====Despite the vast volume of airline productivity and efficiency studies, there is a scarcity of comprehensive surveys and/or reviews of the literature. Rich (2004) surveys previous studies on productivity growth in several transport modes, including air transport, with an emphasis on the impact of technological developments and labor relations. Mallikarjun (2015) offers a rich summary of the literature on airline productivity and efficiency, but it is not a survey paper. Heshmati and Kim (2016) and Yu (2016) appear to offer the only comprehensive reviews and survey of the literature on airline productivity and efficiency in recent years. Both articles identify evolving methodologies and various topical issues covered in the literature and provide insights into the field. However, more rigorous analysis using advanced bibliometric tools could provide further insights.====To extend the existing body of literature, a literature review is needed to identify the gaps in the research and to underscore the knowledge frontier (Tranfield et al., 2003). Bibliometric analysis can help identify established and emerging topical areas and clusters of research and researchers, and it can set the stage for determining emergent field(s) of research. Bibliometric analysis has been widely used to examine the literature in other fields (e.g., Du et al., 2013; Fahimnia et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; van Nunen et al., 2018; Chan, 2019; Yanbing et al., 2020), and it has gradually been applied to the air transport field. Ginieis et al. (2012) utilized a bibliometric tool to review publications on air transportation. They provide a count of the papers published on air transportation during the 1997 to 2009 period and identify the general topical categories of those publications. However, they do not consider airline productivity and efficiency as a specific topical area and group it under “finance”. Bergiante et al. (2015) examine two streams of publications, business models and air transport, in an attempt to map the evolution of airline business models in a bibliometric analysis of publications during the 1990–2012 period. Loos et al. (2016) conduct a bibliometric analysis of publications on airport performance between January 2000 and May 2014. Aldemir and Sengur (2017) reveal the research trend in Turkish air transportation between 1972 and 2016 using a bibliometric analysis of 329 postgraduate theses retrieved from the Turkish Council of Higher Education electronic database. Tanrıverdi et al. (2020) carry out a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and graphical visualization of the articles published in the ==== (JATM) using a CiteSpace visualization of 1483 JATM papers during the 2001–2019 period. Dixit and Jakhar (2021) use bibliometric analysis as an analysis tool for a systematic review of the literature on airport capacity management during the 1990–2019 period. Appendix A provides a summary table of previous bibliometric analysis studies, showing that none addresses the issue of airline productivity and efficiency.====This paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough evaluation of publications in the field of airline productivity and efficiency from 1979 to 2020. To provide additional insights, an overview of the airline productivity and efficiency literature and scientific mapping are developed based on several publication metrics. By employing citation, co-citation, and network analysis methods, our quantitative review complements the existing review studies.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the sources of data and the data collection and compilation processes.

According to ====, U.S. airlines reported substantial losses in three consecutive quarters in 2020, with a loss of $5.2 billion in the first quarter, $11 billion in the second quarter, and $11.8 billion in the third quarter in both domestic and international operations. Compared to high profits accumulated in 2019, with $4.5 billion profit in the third quarter and $3.4 billion profit in the fourth quarter, these losses pose a significant risk to the airline industry and its future. In order to cope with these losses, many airlines have furloughed or laid off many employees, which results in a bigger challenge for the economy in the near future. According to Mr. Calio, the CEO of Airlines for America, the airline industry will not fully rebound until 2024 (====). Given the uncertainty in the trend of the pandemic and the vaccine rollout timeline, the time it takes for the airline industry to come back to normal may even be more uncertain.====While it may take some time for the airline industry to fully recover, it is vital to understand what the industry will look like in the meantime. More specifically, the overarching question that needs answers is what will be air travel during and post COVID-19. Air travel will certainly continue to be on the low side during the pandemic and may start growing after the pandemic. But to what extent? What will air travel be in different COVID-19 remediation scenarios? What will air travel be after the pandemic? The answers to these questions can provide useful information about the status of the airline industry in the medium and long term.====; ====). While these factors still play an important role in determining air travel demand, they do not reflect how the demand changes amid a pandemic, especially an unprecedented one like COVID-19. The airline industry has never experienced anything like this before, including the September 11 event. The impact of COVID-19 on society and transport behavior is dynamic and unpredictable with a high uncertainty level. Thus, a good prediction needs a capability to capture the dynamism of the pandemic and the change in people's travel behavior. The literature on COVID-19's impact on air transportation is rather limited and focused primarily on the impact differences between regions and how airlines reacted to travel restrictions. A specific model that can predict air travel during and post COVID-19 is still missing.====The purpose of this paper is to predict air travel in the U.S. during and post COVID-19 using novel variables. These novel variables are U.S. residents' daily trips by distance since their daily travel decisions change dynamically according to their risk perception of COVID-19. Research shows that the more trips people make amid the pandemic, the safer they feel in their travels (====). In addition, the trip distance does play an important role in their travel behavior in responding to changes in COVID-19 cases and deaths. More specifically, the residents tend to make short trips right after they notice the decrease in COVID-19 cases and deaths, while it takes them more time to decide to make medium and long trips (====). Accordingly, the simulation results in this paper can provide more useful information to run several what-if scenarios to examine how air travel will be during and post pandemic.====The paper is organized as follows. Section ==== reviews the existing literature in air travel prediction and COVID-19's impacts on air transportation. Research gaps are discussed, along with the explanation for the contributions of this study.

The paper highlights the importance of using appropriate metrics to evaluate the financial performance of public sector entities and provides relevant information to bond investors. The devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on airports accentuate the significance of leverage and liquidity. Therefore, the financial metrics discussed in this paper would help support public policy debates and allocate public funds to the airports.","The role of airports has evolved profoundly over the last four decades, from being public utilities to becoming complex businesses. The rapid growth of the airline industry has put tremendous stress on airports' capacity. In the meantime, the intense competition among airlines and the ensuing competition between airports limit airports' ability to increase aeronautical charges that have historically been airports’ primary revenue sources. Consequently, airports have faced challenges to meet the growing needs for significant infrastructure improvement and expansion and to enhance services to airlines, passengers, and other customers. It is imperative, therefore, for airports to be efficient and financially sound. As a result, performance measurement and monitoring have become a vital component of airport management, attracting academic researchers, industry analysts, and practitioners. However, as Bezerra and Gomes (2016) show, many studies on airport performance have focused on productivity, operational efficiency, and service quality. In contrast, studies on the financial viability and strength of airports are limited.====The devastating impacts of the COVID- 19 pandemic on airlines and airports have highlighted the importance of airports' financial resilience for their survival. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to apply pertinent financial performance metrics to measure and compare the financial performance of commercial service airports==== in the United States.

Specifically, we found that curtesy of cabin crew, space available, temperature, cleanliness, service on board and ticket cost are attributes referring to the during the flight stage of the travel that showed heterogeneity in passenger's perceptions. On the contrary, the attributes referring to the before/after the flight stages for which we detected heterogeneity in passengers' perceptions are waiting time at check-in, delay of flight departure, and ticket cost.","Over the years, air transport sector has experienced a considerable development. The globalization process, the economic development and the airlines' deregulation have led more and more people to travel for both business and leisure purposes. To give an idea of the phenomenon, just think that in the decade from 2009 to 2018 the world total revenue traffic increased from 2488 to 4322 million passengers per year (ICAO, 2018). Moreover, as a consequence of the airlines' deregulation the number of airlines entered into the air transport industry significantly increased, causing a stronger competition. In this context, it is evident that provided service quality, as well as passengers' satisfaction, play an important role in the airlines marketing strategies as well as in all the other transport modes (Eboli et al., 2016). As a consequence, also the researchers involved in the transport field have increasingly been relying on air transport service quality. By analysing the related literature, first of all it emerges the separation of the services provided by the airports' managing companies from those provided by the airlines (Bellizzi et al., 2020b). These last are commonly indicated as air side's services. Although the term “air side's services” could lead misunderstanding, it refers to the services provided by the airlines in its entirety: before, during and after the flight experience. Over the past 20 years, there has been growing interest in the air side's service quality (Allen et al., 2020a; Bellizzi et al., 2020c). As it happens in the literature related to the other transport systems, the researchers dealing with the air side's service quality considers the users' viewpoints as a basis of their analyses. Indeed, in most of the studies concerning this topic the data are from Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS) (Allen et al., 2020b).====CSS allow to collect the users' evaluation of the provided service in terms of satisfaction level, perceived quality or importance and performance ratings (Allen et al., 2019). This kind of data has been object of different analyses and studies with very useful practical implications. As an example, some studies analysed the customers’ satisfaction levels to help airlines better understand how the customer views their services relative to their competitors (Liou and Tzeng, 2007; Tsafarakis et al., 2018; Tsaur et al., 2002; Wong and Chung, 2007). Other ones (Chen and Chang, 2005), through the performance and importance ratings, identified the areas for service improvement and resources allocation.====Instead, by analysing and modelling data from Stated Preference (SP) survey it is possible to understand travellers' preferences and behavioural insights. In the literature concerning the air side's services, there is no a conspicuous number of studies using choice data, and in all of them the main adopted approach is the estimation of discrete choice models. Wen and Lai (2010) estimated a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model for identifying the determinants affecting the carrier choice, and by a latent class model simultaneously identified passengers' preferences for air carriers and segment membership functions by taking into account travellers' socioeconomic and trip characteristics. In Martín et al. (2011), the MNL was adopted to assess the potential benefits of frequent flyer programs from the airline's perspective. Wen et al. (2014) presented a factor-analytic specification incorporated into MNL and Generalized Nested Logit models to explore positioning of competing airlines. In other studies, Mixed Logit (ML) models have been proposed in order to consider the heterogeneity among individuals permitting the differences in individuals' perceptions and responses to be considered. Till now, the greatest focus on air passengers' preferences heterogeneity has been brought by Espino et al. (2008). Specifically, they analysed the nature of passengers' preferences for the main air side's services by considering as case study the Gran Canaria-Madrid route.====Based on research into this topic, the aim of this paper is to explore the passengers' preferences heterogeneity using a ML model. To validate the proposed model, data from an SP choice experiments was used. The survey was conducted online and involved the whole population of the University of Calabria (Italy). The SP experiments were designed by considering the main service attributes characterizing the air travellers’ experience within the three different stages: before, during and after the flight. Differently from Espino et al. (2008), we designed two different groups of choice experiments: the first referring to before/after the flight stages, and the second one referring to during the flight experience. For each group, specific attributes were considered. We retain that this is an appropriate manner to capture the perceptions of the flyers regarding airlines service aspects, because the flyer can focus on a specific stage of the travel and therefore avoid possible bias in the provided judgements.====A brief description of the SP survey is reported below, by focusing on the chosen service attributes. This part is followed by the description of the data collection and sample. Then, the model specification is reported.

The turnaround time has a significant impact in terms of marketability and value creation potential of an aircraft and, for this reason, it should be considered as an important driver of fuselage and cabin design decisions. Estimating the turnaround time during the early stages of aircraft design is therefore an essential task. This task becomes even more decisive when designers explore unconventional aircraft architectures or, in general, are still evaluating the fuselage design and its internal layout. In particular, it is of paramount importance to properly estimate the boarding and deboarding times, which contribute for up the 40% to the overall turnaround time. For this purpose, a tool, called SimBaD, has been developed and validated with publicly available data for existing aircraft of different classes. In order to demonstrate SimBaD capability of evaluating the influence of fuselage and cabin features on the turnaround time, its application to an unconventional box-wing aircraft architecture, known as PrandtlPlane, is presented as case study. Finally, considering standard scenarios provided by aircraft manufacturers, a comparison between the turnaround time of the PrandtlPlane and the turnaround time of a conventional competitor aircraft is presented.","The turnaround time (TAT) is the time period in which a landed aircraft is enabled to take-off for a new flight. According to IATA (2017), the standard turnaround process encompasses the following four major tasks: passenger and baggage handling, cargo and mail handling, load control and ramp handling. These tasks, which together can be referred to as ====, define the servicing of an aircraft while it is on the ground, thus determining its TAT. This parameter is a key performance indicator of any aircraft. As a matter of fact, both airlines and airport management companies are interested in the TAT: it is one of the most important contractual items between the two parties, since it affects competitiveness and profitability (More and Sharma, 2014, Wu and Caves, 2000).====According to authors such as Jenkinson et al. (1999), the possibility to evaluate the TAT during the aircraft design phase, allows for the early assessment of its profitability. Assuming an operating scenario where demand is unlimited and no competition exists, the best aircraft utilisation, i.e. the maximum number of flights an aircraft can perform per year, is determined by the TAT. The shorter is the TAT, the higher is the aircraft utilisation, the higher is the aircraft utilisation, the lower is the cost per available seat kilometre (CASK) that the airline bears to carry every single passenger on a certain route. This is because the amount of fixed direct operating costs (DOC) the airline bears to operate the aircraft is spread over an increased number of fares, hence kilometres and passengers (Mirza, 2008).====The efficiency of the aircraft turnaround is therefore an essential element of airlines success, especially for those regional and short-haul carriers (Belobaba et al., 2015) operating with a low cost business model (Lohmann and Koo, 2013) that requires no-frills services to meet the low fares target (Doganis, 2006) in a profitable way. In the perspective of the airline, the TAT represents hence a constraint that limits the value creation potential of the aircraft in its fleet. Moreover, Nyquist and McFadden (2008) found that the average cost to an airline company for each minute spent at the terminal is roughly ====. Thus, each minute saved in the TAT of a flight has the potential to generate considerable annual savings. Reducing idle time on the ground will lead to improved airplane utilisation (Qiang et al., 2014).====When looking at the same problem through the lens of the airport, the TAT is again a constraint, since it limits the number of times per day the airport can sell the occupation of a given slot to airlines. The shorter is the TAT of the aircraft landing, the higher is the number of aircraft served. This not only translates into better aviation economic performance, due to the increased number of aircraft served in a certain time-frame, but also into better operational performance. Shorter TATs translate into higher gates, ground equipment and labour utilisation (Gillen and Lall, 2004) and, at the end, productivity. Nevertheless, higher productivity means also handling more passengers which in turn translates into higher non-aviation revenues potential. This is due to the increased number of people passing through the airport at a certain time.====However, estimating the TAT of a new aircraft design is not a straightforward task. The TAT results from a mechanism of interweaved activities with hierarchies. Among these activities, the ones depending on airport staff can be easily handled in the estimation effort, since airport staff is well trained to accomplish tasks following standard procedures in an efficient time. Whereas for such tasks standard duration used by aircraft manufacturers in Airport Planning manuals (e.g. Airbus and Boeing) can be considered, passengers boarding and deboarding operations need a different approach, since the large variance of their behaviour. A wide range of works on this aspect confirms the issues of simulating/evaluating boarding and deboarding phases (Qiang et al., 2014, Gwynne et al., 2018) in the turnaround process and the consequent TAT estimation.====The present paper aims to address the problem of estimating the TAT in the early stages of aircraft design, providing an approach which can be adopted in many cases, including non-conventional aircraft configurations. For such cases, in fact, the conceptual and preliminary design phases are characterised by a higher level of uncertainty, which also touches the fuselage and cabin layout. The capability of predicting how the TAT is affected by the design choices can be used as a driver to move the design towards shorter TATs and with improved economic performances.====In this context, an in-house simulation model, called SimBaD (Simulation of Boarding and Deboarding), has been developed for the estimation of boarding and deboarding times, considering new cabin layout aspects and deepening the modelling of those important phenomena such as seat interference.====Although the TAT estimation approach here presented is valid for both conventional and non-conventional aircraft, its development has been motivated within the EU funded research project PARSIFAL (Prandtlplane ARchitecture for the Sustainable Improvement of Future AirpLanes, see PARSIFAL (2017)), whose goal was the design and the economic impact assessment of a novel box-wing commercial aircraft architecture known as PrandtlPlane (see Fig. 1).====As detailed in Frediani et al., 2020, Cipolla et al., 2018b, Cipolla et al., 2018a, this aircraft has been conceived to increase the payload capability up to about ==== passengers, while keeping the same overall dimensions of today single aisle aircraft (e.g. Airbus 320 and Boeing 737 families), whose maximum number of seat is about ====. In order to reach such a performance, the cabin has been conceived with a twin-aisle layout (see Fig. 7a in the following), with the peculiar characteristic of aisles wide enough to allow the simultaneous presence of two passengers (e.g. a passenger should be free to walk while another one is storing the luggage in the overhead bin). This feature has been introduced during the conceptual design phase in order to avoid the TAT increase associated to the larger number of passengers.====The goal of this work is twofold. Firstly, it aims at presenting a possible approach to estimate the TAT considering the effects of cabin layout on boarding and deboarding times. Secondarily, it aims at performing the assessment of the TAT for the PARSIFAL PrP case in comparison to conventional competitors.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the state of the art and the contribution of this work. Section 3 preliminary introduces the turnaround activities: some of them, emerge as a criticality for non-conventional aircraft, for which the available data may be null. Then, Section 4 describes SimBaD as a tool for the simulation of boarding and deboarding phases. Section 5 is dedicated to the estimation of the turnaround time of the case study of interest: the PARSIFAL PrP.

It assesses critically the results on major ====. Economists applying impact analysis, have contributed to an irrational policy discussion. The role for morals in the management of airports has been neglected, although there is evidence that incentives might backfire. The paper argues that airport economics based on economics as a moral science could improve airport economics, and make its policy recommendations more relevant.","While I worked on privatisation and regulation of Hamburg Airport in the Ministry of Economic Affairs in 1990s I had the privilege of being advised by two PhD students, the late Martin Kunz and the late Hartmut Wolf. Martin, who studied at Freiburg, adhered to standard neoclassical micro economics, while Hartmut from Kiel followed a transaction cost approach to regulation. Naturally their advice differed, and I had another different approach to economics. With the great heretics of economics Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes as my heroes, and with great sympathy for the evolutionary economics of Alfred Marshall, I was in the awkward position of applying static neoclassical micro economics to reform airport management and regulation. We had great and long discussions on economics. Martin and Hartmut as well as Peter Forsyth, David Gillen, Thomas Immelmann and Mike Tretheway and many more colleagues and friends then shaped and established the Hamburg Aviation Conference, which in 2012 became the European Aviation Conference (EAC). The purpose of the EAC, and in particular the Martin Kunz Lecture, was to bridge the gap between theory and practice. We thought that economics, even neoclassical microeconomics, could really change policy for the better.====Today I would like to criticize this view and offer a more sceptical conclusion, namely that yes, economics can be useful for policy reforms such as privatisation and regulation of airports, but we economists must produce better advice. Our analysis and advice is often not well founded, and often selective in focusing on too narrow concepts of cost efficiency and incentives. We have to be more critical of our own theory and have to see its limitations, and learn that there is a richness of concepts and ideas from non-main stream economic schools which we should apply. This has implications for policy makers. Policy makers, as well as industry managers, must be much more critical of the advice of economists in order to detect the hidden values of the policy advice given by economists. I will come back to this in my conclusions.====Firstly, I shall compare two different models of the scope of method of economics in their regard to relationship between economics and policy. The first one is the standard textbook model of economics as the science which deals with the allocation of scarce resources. Wants are given, and it relies on self-interest and functioning markets. It regards itself as a value free science. This concept of science has its roots in Vienna in the positivist philosophy of Carnap and Popper. In the philosophy of science, it has led to many controversies, and some view it as outdated, but it is still very influential and dominant in economic text books. Less dominating, but still alive is the concept of economics as Moral Science and Philosophy as rooted in Adam Smith's 'Theory of Moral Sentiments' (1759) pre-dating his “Wealth of Nations” (1776).====This is all very general, but it gives the structure to discuss critically the relationship between economics and aviation policy. It gives a list of topics to see the shortcomings of how economics has analysed privatisation and regulation of airports, including policy recommendations. The list includes five points. The first point is that the foundations of airport economics are not well empirically analysed, so that economists disagree fundamentally. Then I argue that empirical analyses of privatisation of airports are too narrowly focused on cost efficiency, and leave out important issues. While there might not be much empirical progress, new theories have been produced. So, I turn to what has been termed as “new airport economics”. I do not discuss the explanatory power of these sophisticated models, but focus only on the policy conclusions. Here I have my doubts, and I hope to persuade you that these models are a theoretical progress and are useful thought exercises, but that they are rather useless for aviation policy. Airport investments, as well as other policy measures, have often been assessed and rationalized by Economic Impact Analysis. This is misleading, and has become an ideology from which my colleagues should abstain from, and which managers and policy makers should not use. Economics can turn into ideology, but economics can also criticize such misuse. Economics has been increasingly criticized of relying exclusively on self-interest. I think we also do this in our analyses of airport privatisation and therefore I will raise the issue whether stronger incentives through privatisation really do lead to better outcomes. Thereafter I will shortly summarize my findings, and draw some lessons for my colleagues in academia, and for managers and policy makers.",Is economics good for aviation policy?

Expanding on the classical economic decision framework, where investment decision-making is entirely based on profitability, our more holistic modeling approach takes into account profitability, flexibility, as well as the ","From the year 1990 until 2014, global scheduled commercial passenger flights increased by 80%, with an expected further 45% growth from 2014 to 2035. However, this growth is being accompanied by an equally strong growth of greenhouse gases and other air pollutant emissions (EASA, 2016). As such, a more sustainable growth in the aviation sector is the common goal for many players in the field, including policy-makers, passengers, manufacturers, and airliners. To achieve sustainable growth, apart from the optimization of the existing systems, new technologies and other innovations need to be developed and implemented. While many research and development projects are underway to develop new technologies, such as hybrid-electric propulsion or hybrid laminar flow control, the diffusion of such technologies into the future fleet is equally important for estimating and ensuring emission reduction. Without widespread market diffusion, the potential impact of innovative technologies cannot be realized. Hence, the study of innovation diffusion is paramount. It could help in many ways, such as in choosing the most promising technologies for large-scale commercialization, or to inform producers and distributors regarding the potential scale and dynamics of adoption and needs for adaptation.====Therefore, our study aims at developing a novel technology diffusion model that is tailored to the aviation sector, and more specifically, the adoption of commercial passenger aircraft models over time. We aim to incorporate various aspects and players in the diffusion process, including the financial institutions that provide the funds for adoption, regulatory bodies that set the standards, and airliners that aim to earn profit, reduce regulatory and fuel price risk, and increase fleet flexibility.====More concretely, we propose an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the diffusion process of commercial passenger aircraft models. ABM is widely used for modeling in the field of aviation, for instance, ABM has been used to model European air traffic and German passenger demand (Grether and Nagel, 2013), and to model departure and seat availability in order to help optimizing passenger-trip assignment (Grether et al., 2013). However, few studies have been done regarding the diffusion of new innovative aircraft models and to examine the economics and the decision-making process behind such adoption behavior. It is thus our goal to fill the gap with the current study on the aircraft market diffusion process using ABM. In doing so, we contribute to the literature by extending the application of ABM to innovation diffusion in the aviation industry, where this methodology has previously barely been used. In addition, we base our model on real-world sales data and also model the supply constraints of the aircraft manufacturing industry through limited production capacities. Moreover, we employ a holistic modeling approach that includes profitability, flexibility and environmental impact with a focus on the main types of mid-range passenger jet aircraft models by the two largest manufacturers — the A320 series of Airbus and the 737 series of Boeing, respectively. Overall, our validation results show that our model is relevant and suitable for the forecast of innovation diffusion in the aviation industry.====The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. Section 2 reviews past studies and relevant literature. Section 3 establishes our methodology, namely the model setup, its parametrization, as well as the calculation details of the model. Section 4 presents the simulation results of the diffusion of several aircraft models in order to validate our model.

In the last years, the number of non-aeronautical activities has substantially increased and significantly diversified both before and after the security checkpoint. The established role of non-aeronautical activities forces planners and managers to better understand passenger behavior. The potential of discrete choice models for the exploration of passenger behavior is analyzed in this paper. For the demonstration of the methodology, Lisbon Humberto Delgado International airport is used as a case study. Data is collected through a revealed and ==== survey inside the terminal at the area before the security checkpoint. Activity-choice models are developed to identify the factors that affect the choices of the passengers over the area where they conduct non-aeronautical activities. Forecasts show that when increasing the percentage of passengers who conduct the check-in online and have planned their activities before arriving at the airport, the passengers’ preferences to conduct non-aeronautical activities only after the security checkpoint increase. This paper shows the contribution of developing discrete choice models in the better comprehension of passenger decisions over the activities they perform in an airport terminal.","As aviation demand and the role of passengers in airports’ operations are constantly changing, pressure is posed on the airports’ side to ensure that their capacity will accommodate efficiently both aircrafts and passengers. Passengers are viewed as direct airport customers attracting the interest of airport managers and moving away from the conservative and outdated view of being only airline customers (Graham, 2013). In addition to the general change in traffic volumes, the need to better understand passenger behavior is arising as the composition and preferences of the passenger population changes. Demand has been increasing but research shows that this is rather attributed to increases in travel frequencies than the actual increase in the number of people travelling (Alegre et al., 2009). This holds especially for business trips (Barros and Machado, 2010; Castillo-Manzano et al., 2011) and for modern tourism which is characterized by short and frequent stays spread throughout the year (Ferrer-Rosell et al., 2014; Salmasi et al., 2012).====In this aviation environment, airports provide a variety of activities related to both the preparation of the passengers for their air trip (aeronautical) and their free time inside the terminal (non-aeronautical). In the last 20 years, the number of non-aeronautical activities has substantially increased and significantly diversified both before and after the security checkpoint. The most common non-aeronautical facilities met at an airport terminal are: (a) Food and Beverage (F&B) and convenience retail (grab-and-go items) that cover passenger needs and (b) Duty Free/News/Gift and Specialty Retail that cover passenger wants. However, more specialized activities might be met at many airports such as casinos, cinemas, golf, spa, wellness centers among others. It is estimated that in 2018, the non-aeronautical revenues of these activities counted for around 40% of total airport revenues internationally (ACI, 2019). The composition of non-aeronautical revenues has been relatively stable during the last years with retail contributing the most (approximately 33%), then car-parking being the second biggest revenue source (approximately 23%) and car rental being third biggest contributor (approximately 8%) (Chen et al., 2020). The airport environment has an impact on these figures as well-designed and aesthetically pleasant environments tend to both improve the passenger experience and enhance airport revenues. An enjoyable passenger experience in the terminal has a positive impact on the shopping behavior of passengers and research has shown that “delighted” passengers spend 45% more than “disappointed” passengers on airport retail purchases ($20,55 versus $14,12) (J.D. Power and Associates Reports, 2010).====Airport passenger perceptions over the airport environment and the involved processes may vary. For example, different passenger tastes on technological innovationσ, at the check-in process for example, implies the provision of different processes for different passenger segments (Halpern et al., 2021). Better understanding of passenger behavior is required in order to improve airport operations and enhance the passenger experience and airport business opportunities. Although airport planning and management are traditionally approached as a top-down process, it is suggested that when it comes to passenger preferences and the space distribution of certain areas of the passenger building a bottom-up approach could be followed to explore passenger preferences to the services that are offered to them. The quantification of the different tastes of people, as a reflection of the human element, can materialize using Discrete Choice Models (DCM) (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985). Discrete choice models can provide insights regarding the factors that form passenger activity choices while in an airport. Both airport planners and managers could better comprehend passenger behavior and make decisions on their processes. Relevant models could shed light on passengers’ activities upon arrival at the airport. In the airport sector there is the general belief that departing passengers underuse the areas before security because of the stress they undergo to fulfill on time all airport processes and avoid possible delays as soon as possible after arriving at the airport. Long distances in airports raise the level of anxiety for travelers, whose objective is to get straight to the departure gate (Crawford and Melewar, 2006). However, apart from some statistical analysis over space utilization (Livingstone, 2014), there is no study that analyzes which type of passengers use the areas before and after the security control. Hence, it could be interesting to analyze the kind of activities the passengers perform before the security checkpoint, the areas in the airport building where the passengers choose to perform non-aeronautical activities (only before the security checkpoint, only after, in both areas or nowhere) and what the passengers do after the security checkpoint and before boarding (this choice might concern either single choices or a set of activities). In this way, airport managers could identify the areas the passengers prefer to use, the kind of activities they choose and extract mobility patterns in airport building (origin-destination sets and route choices).====This paper deals with the issue of air passenger behavior before flight departure and the potential of modeling passenger behavior in the terminal in an attempt to explain and predict the choices of passengers to perform non-aeronautical activities before, after the security checkpoint, in both areas or nowhere. Lisbon airport is used as a case study and relevant data was collected through a survey conducted at the airport terminal. Logit models were estimated to reveal the factors that affect passenger choices and then, were used to forecast changes in passenger choices under different scenarios such as changes in the percentage of passengers who perform the check-in online and preplan the activities before arriving at the airport. The application of the models showed that changes in the check-in mode and the option of passengers to pre-plan their activities before arriving at the airport can affect their activity choices in the airport building. Although one airport was used as case study and the results concern the airport operations, activity offer and passenger behavior before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the suggested methodology and survey design could be applied to any type of airport. The presented work could contribute to better comprehend passenger activity choices within airport terminals and introduces a new application of discrete choice modeling in airport management so that operators understand passenger preferences over where to perform non-aeronautical activities.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 present previous research of air passenger behavior and discusses the potential use of passenger behavior models in the airport planning process and operations. Section 3 briefly presents choice theory and the case study application. In Section 4 the models that explain passenger choices are presented.

Three mechanisms are assessed at the ECAC-wide level: 4D trajectory adjustments (a combination of actively waiting for connecting passengers and dynamic cost indexing), flight prioritisation (enabling ATFM slot swapping at arrival regulations), and flight arrival coordination (where flights are sequenced in extended arrival managers based on an advanced cost-driven optimisation). Classical and new metrics, designed to capture network effects, are used to analyse the results of a micro-level agent-based model. A scenario with congestion at three hubs is used to assess the 4D trajectory adjustment and the flight prioritisation mechanisms. Two different scopes for the extended arrival manager are modelled to analyse the impact of the flight arrival coordination mechanism. Results show that the 4D trajectory adjustments mechanism succeeds in reducing costs and delays for connecting passengers. A trade-off between the interests of the airlines in reducing costs and those of non-connecting passengers emerges, although passengers benefit overall from the mechanism. Flight prioritisation is found to have no significant effects at the network level, as it is applied to a small number of flights. Advanced flight arrival coordination, as implemented, increases delays and costs in the system. The arrival manager optimises the arrival sequence of all flights within its scope but does not consider flight uncertainties, thus leading to sub-optimal actions.","Understanding the complex interdependencies and coupling of various components of the ATM system is a major challenge for ATM architects. Assessing how the introduction of changes in one (sub)system may impact others, not only locally, but also at the network level, is particularly difficult. The ‘Airspace Architecture Study’ (SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2019b) highlights how the ATM system can be understood as nodes, which are often operating close to maximum capacity and without appropriately connected resources: disruptions in the system often propagate and “knock it out of optimal flow”. This ‘domino’ effect is offset, for example, by strategically placed buffers in schedules, although these are often insufficient to absorb all of the disturbance(s). The Study indicates the need for “stronger linking between airspace, operations and technical evolution and measurement of the impact through simulations factoring in known deployments ...”. It also recommends targeted incentives for “early movers”. The ‘Transition Plan’ (SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2019a) further endorses the acceleration of market uptake of the next generation SESAR technologies and services to support defragmentation. The Plan identifies three key operational and technical measures that need to be implemented in the very short term (2020 to 2025), to initiate the changes outlined. These measures will allow different parts of the system to be developed at different paces, while maintaining coherence at the network level and awareness of local needs.====Previous research has highlighted the need to consider different stakeholders in order to fully understand the impact of introducing changes in the ATM system (Cook et al., 2016, Delgado et al., 2020). Domino, an H2020 — SESAR JU Research and Innovation project, expands some of these concepts by further developing a model (Mercury) to assess the coupling of ATM systems from a flight and passenger perspective. Mercury is able to model a whole day of operations at the ECAC level following flights and passengers (Domino Consortium, 2019). It allows ATM system designers to better understand the relationships between (sub)systems and the nature of such relationships, which emerge in a given technological and operational context. The outcome of the model is analysed with the use of classical and advanced network metrics (centrality and causality), which afford new insights into the impact of modifying the ATM system at the network level — see Zanin and Lillo (2013) and Cook et al. (2015) for an early review of the value of non-classical metrics and the need to differentiate between flight- and passenger-centric indicators.====Exploring several issues outlined in the Airspace Architecture Study (SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2019b), in the context of different (future) operational and stressed environments, this paper presents the assessment of three mechanisms: 4D flight trajectory adjustments (4DTA), flight prioritisation (FP) and flight arrival coordination (FAC). These mechanisms are modelled considering a baseline, which resembles current practices, and as an advanced implementation, in two distinct scenarios.====4DTA is composed of two sub-mechanisms: (i) dynamic cost indexing (DCI), whereby a flight is able to adjust its cruise speed to manage expected delay (Cook et al., 2009); and (ii) waiting for passengers (WfP), whereby a flight can wait at-gate for late connecting passengers (Delgado et al., 2016, Cook et al., 2016). FP is inspired by UDPP concepts allowing the swapping of ATFM slots among airlines (Pilon et al., 2016, SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2018). FAC provides advanced management of fight arrivals for the sequencing and merging thereof (Bagieu, 2015, Montlaur and Delgado, 2017).====The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the background concerning the model developed in Domino (Mercury), as well as its main characteristics. It also provides a literature review on the use of agent-based models (ABM) in ATM and the contributions of Mercury towards the development of advanced tools for the assessment of air traffic management initiatives. Section 3 describes the three mechanisms analysed in this paper in more detail and outlines the advancement on the state of the art with respect to these mechanisms. The outcome of the model needs to be analysed in order to gain an insight into the impact of the mechanisms in the system. In particular, dedicated advanced network metrics have been developed as part of the Domino project. These metrics are described in Section 4.

At the end of 2020, the ratios of daily fuel consumption and aircraft emissions of 2020 to 2019 rebounded to about 0.875, suggesting the domestic commercial flights were nearly fully recovered. Our results may provide practical guidance and meaningful expectation for commercial aircraft management for other countries.","The outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic 2019 has an unprecedented effect on public life worldwide (====), as the virus can infect both humans and a wide range of animals (====). China, the United States, and several other countries have instituted temporary travel restrictions to slow down COVID-19 spread (====).====As presented by ====, aviation is one of the most significant initial contributors to the COVID-19 spread. Many countries then reduced air transport associated with pandemic centers. As a result, there was a sharp decrease in the number of domestic and international passenger flights. International markets suffered a more severe depression than domestic markets (====), except air logistics airlines suffering less depression (====), and ultra-long-haul flights outperforming other business models (====). From the perspective connectivity with other airports, the Southern hemisphere undergoes a more severe drop than the Northern part (====). Immediate policy designs are necessary to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on the airline industry around the globe (====). For example, governments have prioritized maintaining air transport connectivity (====). Due to the preliminary control of COVID-19 in some countries, international air travel bans are relaxed to recover the economy (====), which may lead to a likelihood of the aviation business rebounding at a slower pace with V-shape and U-shape recovery (====).====Significantly disrupted aviation caused a subsequent reduction in fuel consumption and aircraft emissions. Fuel consumption influences airlines' profit and aircraft emissions can affect the environment and climate (====). For example, the contribution of CO==== is estimated to represent 36%–51% of the total aviation radiative forcing of climate, including short-term climate forcers (====; ====). In addition to CO====, NO==== emission from fuel combustion is estimated to account for about 65% of the global total NO==== emission (====). NO==== also induces some extra consequences for climate and human health (====). Thus, accurate fuel burn estimation models are necessary to evaluate the amount of fuel consumption and CO==== emissions (====). The Aircraft Performance Model Implementation software is developed to simulate the global commercial flight fuel burn and emissions during 2006–2011 (====). Fuel consumption and CO==== emission of a specific route are estimated by cluster analysis on historical trajectory data (====). To better calculate aircraft fuel burn during ground operations, ==== used aircraft trajectory data acquired from an airport surface surveillance system. Different from the methods mentioned above, our study uses the ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) data to calculate the fuel consumption and aircraft emissions based on the International Civil Aviation Organization's Engine Emissions Databank (ICAO's EEDB) and Base of Aircraft Data (BADA), because ADS-B data are easily accessible.====Although the immediate impact of COVID-19 on aviation has been actively studied (====; ====), the medium-term and long-term impacts are still unclear, as air travel in most of the major countries is still struggling to rebound to the level before the pandemic. However, China's successful control of COVID-19 provides us with a rare opportunity to quantify the impacts, as its domestic air demand has largely recovered by the end of 2020. In this study, we analyzed the two-year ADS-B data and calculated flight volume, aircraft usage, fuel consumption, and aircraft emissions among routes between four selected major Chinese international airports, Beijing (ZBAA), Shanghai (ZSSS), Guangzhou (ZGGG), and Wuhan (ZHHH). Since two of the cities were epicenters of the major outbreaks in the early and middle of 2020, our study allows us to elucidate both the abrupt decline and the year-long recovery of domestic aviation. Therefore, our study may shed some light on how the air travel activity was impacted both in different countries and at different pandemic stages.====The paper is organized as follows.

As expenses for jet fuel are one of the most relevant cost factors for airlines, their economic success largely depends on the ability to match changes on the cost side with an adaption on the revenue side. While previous studies primarily focused on the impact of fuel price changes to consumer prices, this paper empirically examines the ability of US airlines to pass-through lagged jet fuel prices to scaled operating revenues from an airline driven perspective. Our results suggest that the extent to which an exogenous increase in fuel prices can be passed on to revenues will deviate according to the competitive situation faced by an airline. Based on these findings our research should also be of interest for European policy makers who are discussing actions to exogenously increase jet fuel prices due to environmental reasons.","An airline's revenue is determined by the quantity and price of the tickets offered to the market. While most crucial decisions that influence the quantity offered (e.g., routes served and operated aircraft) must be made well before a flight takes place, airlines can still adjust their ticket prices. The corresponding flight schedule also provides the basis to estimate future fuel volumes. Airlines nevertheless remain exposed to fluctuating fuel prices. The only chance for an airline to compensate for volatile commodity prices in a deregulated market in the short to medium run is therefore passing them through to its customers (see, e.g., Koopmans and Lieshout (2016)). While previous studies dealing with airline pass-through behavior almost exclusively focused on the impact of jet fuel price changes to customer's ticket prices (see, e.g., Wadud (2015), Wang et al. (2018), Scotti and Volta (2018) or Atems et al. (2019)), this paper focuses on the question how fuel price changes influence scaled airline revenues. This inherently takes into account the price elasticity of demand on airline level. Hence, in contrast to studies analyzing pass-through rates from a customer's point of view, our aim is to engage the question from a different perspective: Focusing on the pass-through towards operating revenues, we focus on a key performance indicator that should be of paramount importance from an airline's perspective. Taking a look at, for example, Southwest Airlines, demonstrates the importance of this issue in practice: Southwest Airlines burnt approximately 50 M barrel of jet fuel in 2019 (see, Southwest Airlines (2020)). Hence, an increase in average fuel prices by only $10 per barrel without any pass-through to revenues would have led to a decrease in net income by 500 M US Dollar. However, if Southwest Airlines had successfully enforced a pass-through to total revenues of, e.g., 80%, net income would have decreased by only 100 M US Dollar. Hence, the successful pass-through would have saved 400 M US Dollar of net income for the company.====With this paper, we primarily aim to provide guidance to three main groups of stakeholders: (1) airline managers, (2) competition authorities and (3) policy makers. The actual pass-through of jet fuel prices to airline revenues is of high interest to all stakeholder groups due to a variety of reasons.====First, it appears likely that airline revenue management will usually aim at maximizing total revenue. Moreover, revenue management will favor to pass-through input price increases rather than price decreases==== to its customers (see, e.g., Koopmans and Lieshout (2016)) as the best response to volatile jet fuel market prices. Hence, an econometric ex-post examination regarding how and under what circumstances airlines managed to successfully pass-through fuel price changes asymmetrically towards revenues in the past should be of particular interest to airline managers.====Secondly, in markets where major waves of consolidation take place, competition authorities monitor competitor practices regarding changes to input prices and therefore if (mutual) inter-company agreements with regard to fuel price pass-through might be in place. In 2015, the US Department of Justice started legal investigations regarding a potential non-pass-through of fuel price decreases by major US carriers in recent years. While this lawsuit is still pending for some airlines, others, e.g., American Airlines agreed on paying up to 45 million US Dollar to settle the legal dispute without admitting any wrongdoing (see, e.g., Harris and Schlangenstein (2018)). Analyzing pass-through behavior from a revenue perspective may help to offer a new perspective for competition authorities.====Thirdly, especially in Europe, the recent environmental debate is heavily focused to implement measures to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the airline industry. In this context, a newly published research report by the European Commission (2019) discusses the implementation of a massive==== jet fuel tax for airlines in detail. Such a tax would, ceteris paribus, increase jet fuel prices by adding a fixed monetary amount to each unit of jet fuel burnt. To assess the environmental and macroeconomic impact of such a tax, it should be of interest to policy makers to understand how and to what extent different airlines would actually be able to absorb such a price increase via a direct pass-through to their revenues.",Commodity price pass-through in the US airline industry and the hidden perks of consolidation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000831,21 June 2021,2021,Research Article,180.0

It is important to protect such critical infrastructure from natural and manmade risks. However, it is difficult to build a risk prediction model based only on past statistical data. An experienced expert-based Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach could be used to measure an airport's ","Air transport infrastructure forms the foundation for today's international commercial and cultural exchange activities. Disruptions to an air transport system due to internal accidents or external attacks can therefore have a serious impact on everyday life in modern societies (Metzner, 2019). Air transport systems operated by alliances between different airlines scheduling flights between airports in different countries and regions around the world, for the transport of air cargo shipments and passengers will be affected by the impact of different disruptive events (Damgacioglu et al., 2018; Janić, 2019). Moreover, in view of the steady growth of people's need and desire to travel abroad, more attention is being paid to other aspects such as the quality of service, security, and administrative efficiency. The ability of the transportation systems to resist disruption and ensure adaptability has become increasingly important (Dunn and Wilkinson, 2016).====Air transport is the fastest and most convenient means of moving people and objects over long distances. A key element of this infrastructure, at the center of international transportation, is the “airport”. Airport failures can cause serious problems, including restricted entry and exit, flight delays, and passenger panic. For example, in December 2017, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport in the United States, one of the busiest airports in the world, suffered a power outage for nearly 11 h due to an electrical fire in the tunnel below the airport. In addition to the frustration due to the disruption of airport operations, it also suffered a huge loss in terms of compensation (Sun et al., 2020). Such losses show that runway maintenance, aircraft ground operation management, and ground emergency response measures are all important tasks for the maintenance of airport functionality.====Since the United States suffered a terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, many countries have actively developed security management policies and counter-terrorism measures for their airports (Ito and Lee, 2005). According to the National Academy of Sciences, the four aspects of the resilience of any system are defined as follows: to plan and prepare for, to absorb, to respond to, and to recover from disasters. In air transport systems, resilience refers to the ability to prevent or mitigate any threat to air traffic operations (Clark et al., 2018; Yanjun et al., 2019; Pishdar et al., 2019). In recent years, numerous studies related to the resilience of the air transportation system have appeared. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is the tool usually used to estimate the cost and protective benefits of security measures for security risk assessment. However, Stewart and Mueller (2014) pointed out that CBA analysis could not prove that the current estimated airport security costs are reasonable, and they acknowledged that more simulation experiments are needed to explore the interdependencies existing in airport security. Malandri et al. (2017) proposed a model for the evaluation of the reliability of the mass transit network in the airport area. The high cost of flight delays due to late arrivals may tempt pilots to increase navigational risks in order to meet expected arrival times. There should be multiple airport transportation options to address this problem. Knol et al. (2019) conducted a literature review of airport security systems. They found that the most common assessment factors are the likelihood, vulnerability, and consequences of the threat. They also applied a cognitive agent model to analyze the performance of airport security inspections. Skorupski and Uchroński (2017) developed a fuzzy inference model for evaluating the performance of airport security checkpoints through inferred airport security performance from expert interviews and questionnaires, taking into account the efficiency of prohibited item detection, the ability of security control, and service quality.====Lykou et al. (2019) proposed a risk assessment model for smart airport network security. The goal of their study was to actively mitigate malicious attacks and threats to ensure the robustness of the airport network system. Zhou and Chen (2020) focused on the analysis of an airport's resilience performance given severe weather, using the “speed of recovery” as a measure of the resilience of the airport. Their study findings show that airport resilience to severe weather events varies greatly depending on several factors, such as the level of modal substitution, airport capacity, and weather conditions. Bao and Zhang (2018) developed a quantitative framework for large-scale airport resilience assessment to determine how vulnerability and adaptability affect airport system resilience. Yanjun et al. (2019) created a novel simulation model to explore the operational performance of the air transport system when airports operate at degraded capacity rather than completely shutting down. The model simultaneously includes the perspectives of dynamical and structural aspects in their analyze of airport network resilience. There have been several other studies related to airport security protection, which have contributed to the safety assessment of global transportation systems (Yanjun et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019; Thompson and Tran, 2019).====However, a comprehensive framework for resilience assessment for airports has not yet been constructed. This is a complex and difficult Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. The objective of MCDM is to seek an ideal or optimal solution while considering many conflicting criteria. Airport resilience is here defined as “the ability of an airport to quickly and effectively react to hazards and reduce their impact, and quickly return to normal conditions in the event of a crisis.” This study proposes a novel MCDM assessment framework to measure airport resilience and provide directions for improvement. The framework includes four dimensions, which are detection capability, resistance capability, rescue capability, and recovery capability, with a total of 27 criteria. These four dimensions correspond to the four aspects of the resilience assessment of critical infrastructure, namely “reduced failure probabilities,” “reduced consequences from failures,” “reduced time to recovery,” and “the means of resourcefulness and redundancy” (Bruneau et al., 2003). The definitions of the four dimensions are summarized as follows.====In order to achieve the goal of this research, we propose a two-stage approach. First of all, the Bayesian Best Worst Method (Bayesian BWM) is used to determine the optimal group weights of the 27 criteria. Bayesian BWM is a novel group decision analysis technique that overcomes the shortcomings of using conventional arithmetic mean to integrate experts’ opinions with statistical estimation methods (Mohammadi and Rezaei, 2019). A criterion with a larger weight indicates that it is relatively more important in the assessment system. After this, a modified Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (modified PROMETHEE) technique is used to assess the resilience performance of the airport. The modified PROMETHEE introduces the concept of the aspiration level into the conventional PROMETHEE. This approach replaces the conventional concept of the “relative satisfaction” with the “aspiration level”. Knowing how far the alternatives are from the aspiration level helps to make suggestions for improvement, so that more management information can be obtained in practical applications (Lo et al., 2019). The assessed airports can assess their performance under each criterion, and thus ascertain what abilities they are lacking. This study provides a systematic resilience assessment framework for airports which can assist policy makers in developing more appropriate protection strategies.====To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply the concepts of MCDM for performance assessment of airport resilience. The method is integrated with advanced techniques, namely Bayesian BWM and modified PROMETHEE, to define the gap between the alternatives and the aspiration level.

These high value employees have often been subjected to cost-focused travel policies potentially to the detriment of their well-being. From a theoretical viewpoint, the boundaries of the existing sales literature are expanded to show how this unique group of salespeople, road warriors, face stressors and how these relate to major sales focused outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions). Further, this study adds an additional construct, travel friction, into the literature, yielding support for the importance of developing our understanding of this construct. Travel friction is found as a significant antecedent to both work-family conflict and emotional exhaustion. Moreover, through emotional exhaustion both travel friction and work-family conflict ultimately manifest in reduced job satisfaction, diminished organizational commitment, and increased attrition risk. The lack of business travel in the short-term due to the global pandemic offers corporate travel managers a unique opportunity to pause and recalibrate their travel policies to focus more on traveler well-being. Practical suggestions from travel experts that can potentially help to mitigate travel friction among road warriors are offered.","Business travel is a vital segment of the air transport market. In 2019 alone, U.S. residents amassed 464.4 million person-trips for business purposes (U.S. Travel Association, 2019). Moreover, direct spending, including expenditures on meetings, events and incentive programs by domestic and international business travelers exceeded $300 billion (U.S. Travel Association, 2019), illustrating the wider economic impact of business travel. While the COVID-19 global pandemic has all but eliminated business travel in the short term, at least a portion of this business travel will eventually return.====Among business travelers there are a special breed of dealmakers that travel more often than the rest. Dubbed as ‘road warriors’ by the industry trade press, these employees travel mostly by air and spend a significant portion of each month away from home on business (MMGY Global and Gillespie, 2018). Often working in sales, many of these road warriors have been subjected to cost-focused corporate travel policies for decades now without a deep understanding of how these travel policies impact the effectiveness, efficiency or well-being of these road warriors. This is important because studies have found that the departure of a salesperson can cost an organization between 25% and 200% of the salesperson's annual compensation (Pinkovitz et al. 1997; Lewin and Sager 2010). Losing highly paid employees requiring specialized training can be expensive. Such costs result from (1) lost business from the departed salesperson, (2) replacement costs and (3) losing business during the learning curve for the new salesperson (Russ and McNeilly, 1995). Additional indirect costs can include reduced team morale, decreased productivity, and the loss of institutional knowledge (Arc et al., 2017).====Beyond employee well-being, unproductive trips have a negative impact on companies as well. Corporate travel managers have come to realize that there are costs associated with flight delays, cancellations, and missed connections that may leave high value employees stranded in unproductive situations with additional travel expenses (Sherry, 2015). Considering these ramifications, travel experts in recent years have sought to better understand the accumulated stress (e.g., wear and tear) – often referred to as travel friction – on these road warriors. One group of experts in particular has developed a series of yearly reports based on surveys with road warriors indicating that business travel friction can lead to negative outcomes (MMGY Global and Gillespie, 2018). For instance, in 2018, 24% of their survey respondents indicated they would probably leave their job within two years – a costly attrition risk. Despite the widespread impact on the aviation and travel industries, as of the present time, travel friction and related stressors associated with business travel have received limited attention from the academic community (e.g., Jensen, 2014).====In contrast, job burnout has been studied for several decades now within academia. Described as a condition in which people become emotionally exhausted from the stress associated with their work circumstances, job burnout has been established as a unique syndrome distinct from depression that can be empirically measured (Cordes and Dougherty, 1993; Maslach and Leiter, 2008). In 2019 job burnout became officially recognized as a medical condition by the World Health Organization (Brown, 2019). As a boundary-spanning position, salespeople are often at increased risk for burnout and related stressors such as role conflict and ambiguity because they not only have to balance demands internally within the company, but these demands may, at times, compete with those of external constituencies. For instance, company policy such as requiring maximum or minimum purchase order sizes may conflict with external supplier capabilities or customer needs – all of which may be within the salesperson's sphere of influence and job responsibility to manage. As such, burnout within a sales context has been studied heavily (e.g., Lewin and Sager, 2007; Shepherd et al., 2011).====Yet, sales researchers have not investigated a potential link between business travel and salesperson burnout. A recent meta-analysis involving salesperson burnout research notes that this area of study has stalled in recent years and most of the future gains in knowledge will come from context-specific study of salesperson burnout (Edmondson et al., 2019). Salesperson business travel is one such context-specific area that has received limited scholarly attention. Despite the stresses involved, business travel is necessary as global managers understand that face-to-face meetings are needed to solve problems, negotiate contracts, close deals, gain respect, and foster long-term trust (Ivancevich et al., 2003). These same scholars note that given the amount that companies spend on business-related travel per year, it is surprising and concerning that the associated physiological and psychological impacts have not been examined more widely (Chen, 2017; Ivancevich et al., 2003).====Therefore, this study serves as an opportunity to incorporate insights from business travel experts, while at the same time advancing knowledge of salesperson burnout theory within academia. For academic sales researchers, the road warrior setting offers a unique context through which to test the impact of traditional burnout-related concepts such as work-family conflict and emotional exhaustion, while introducing the potential impact of a new construct, travel friction. At the same time, the knowledge gained from this research will help managers and business travel experts to better understand the interrelationships between the theoretical constructs. Hence, this study will address three related research questions: (1) Is travel friction a theoretically and empirically distinct construct? (2) Is travel friction an antecedent to more generalized and commonly known sources of salesperson distress such as work-family conflict and emotional exhaustion? (3) Does travel friction ultimately manifest in reduced job satisfaction, diminished organizational commitment, and increased turnover intentions?====To answer these research questions, this study will introduce a theoretically-grounded path model for testing. While there is evidence in trade reports and other academic road warrior contexts outside of sales to suggest linkages between business travel and burnout exist, an empirically tested path model controlling for related factors within sales can help to further explicate the associations. As such, this research is organized as follows. First, a literature review will be conducted to define road warriors, travel friction, and to reflect the state of research involving both. A corresponding state of research on salesperson burnout will also be provided to highlight gaps in the literature and to demonstrate the salience of travel friction for study within a salesperson burnout context. Next, a theoretically-grounded path model will be introduced along with hypothesis development. The methodology for testing will be explained, along with reporting of the results. The paper will conclude with discussion and managerial implications of the findings, along with the associated limitations of the study and avenues for future research.",The negative effects of travel friction among road warrior salespeople,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000703,11 June 2021,2021,Research Article,182.0

We look at the competitiveness levels by analyzing the competitive environment of the industry nationally and internationally both before and post IGA (estimated). We use fuzzy ==== (FTOPSIS) based on the Fuzzy ,"Commercially speaking, the air cargo industry comprises more than 35% of global trade (IATA, 2018). The industry has made a 10.4% increase in demand which is measured in freight tonne kilometers (FTK), in the first half of 2017 compared to a similar period in the previous year. This growth represents the strongest increase since the fall that followed the Global Economic Crisis of 2010 (Turkish Cargo, 2017a, Turkish Cargo, 2017b). Although trade tensions and volatile fuel prices posed a threat to the air cargo market, the positive effects of synchronized global economic expansion, increased industrial production, and growth in world trade were key factors supporting the recovery in 2017. In line with this recovery, more than double growth is expected with 4,2% per year in world air cargo traffic and by more than 75% increase in world freighter fleet between 2018 and 2037 (Boeing, 2018).====Turkey has a huge potential in terms of air cargo and is one of the biggest contributors to this growing trend in the global market. Despite having demonstrated huge and ongoing growth in recent years under the 2023 logistics vision of Turkey, the country still has the potential to do better in terms of air cargo in light of the growth projections mentioned above. Also, within the scope of its 2023 logistics vision, Turkey is aiming at $500 billion worth of exports across the economy. It expects to generate approximately $70 billion of this amount from air cargo (Aksoy, 2013). Additionally, Turkish Cargo, a brand of Turkish Airlines, is targeting being in the top 5 in the world by 2023. However, the lack of sufficient capacity allocation for cargo at the Istanbul Atatürk Airport, where the majority of the cargo operations in the Turkish air cargo industry were conducted, has been cited as the main reason that prevents the Turkish air cargo industry from reaching its potential. In this regard, plans were put in place in 2010 for the construction of the Istanbul Airport (IGA) which is expected to make a significant contribution to the competitiveness of the industry, and construction started in 2014. The first phase of the Istanbul airport started to operate at the end of October 2018. While airline passenger operations started at the airport, it was stated by the authorities that the cargo operations will continue to be held at the Atatürk airport for a while.====Porter (2016) states that new competitive positions could emerge as a result of major changes in sectoral structures. Firms that can analyze the competitiveness of the sector using Porter's five forces stand a better chance of seizing the opportunities that result from these changes, and so occupy new strategic positions (Porter, 2016, pp. 90–91). In this context, with the operationalization of IGA, there are two expectations. First, the existing air cargo carriers will intent to increase their market share by taking advantage of the new opportunities. Second, new air cargo carriers will possibly enter the industry depending on the significant capacity increase and the growing trend of the Turkish air cargo industry.====As such, currently, one of the most important issues for existing carriers is to sustain and increase their available market share without losing their position to potential competitors, while the new competitors are looking for ways to make use of the opportunities created by the sectoral changes to obtain their market share. In this regard, this study aims to determine the best competitive strategy that can be applied by air cargo carriers in the Turkish air cargo industry with the operationalization of IGA. To achieve this goal, first, competitive analysis is conducted using Porter's five forces, and thereafter, the competitiveness level of the industry both nationally and internationally is determined by looking at the period before IGA and post IGA (estimated).====The study uses FTOPSIS based on FAHP by integrating the framework of Porter's five forces analysis. The FAHP hierarchy includes the five forces as the main criteria and the sub-criteria of each force. In the first step of the study, the main and the sub-criteria is weighted with FAHP. In the next step, the study determines, using the FTOPSIS method, the best of Porter (1980) competitive strategies to be applied by existing carriers and potential entrants into the Turkish air cargo industry.====In the literature, there are only a few studies on the Turkish air cargo industry. Most of the studies conducted in this field considered operational aspects while no study has examined the industry strategies and analyzed its competitive status. Table 1 shows the previous work that used the analysis methods employed by this study.====The literature shows that there are only a small number of studies on air cargo transportation that used multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM). In one of these studies, Yoon and Park (2015) described the competitive service factors of airlines from the perspective of forwarders on the Korean export market. To do this, they used an AHP method on selected relevant officers of 50 airlines in the cargo forwarding business. In their study evaluating the customer value of three express service providers (UPS, FedEx, and DHL), from the point of view of the senders in Taiwan, Ding et al. (2016) presented a fuzzy MCDM model. To test the consistency of the fuzzy MCDM model, the GMIR method was used in the final ranking of the alternatives. In another study using the AHP method, Park et al. (2009), unlike Yoon and Park (2015), explored the competitiveness of air cargo express carriers in Korea and the partial importance of factors affecting the adoption of air express delivery services. Huang and Hsu (2016), in their study, which used the FAHP method, demonstrated the service requirements of combined air cargo carriers. The Best Worst Method (BWM), which is a new MCDM method that has gained popularity in recent years, was used by Rezaei et al. (2017). In their study, they intended to identify the best structure (configuration) for the selected output stations (outstation) supplying cargo to the hubs of KLM airlines at Schiphol Airport. In an integrated study using Fuzzy Delphi and FAHP methods, Chao and Kao (2015) explored how an airline chooses a strategic cargo alliance for partnership.====Various studies in the literature present an integration of the MCDM methods and Porter's five forces. One of these studies was a case study conducted by Dağdeviren and Yüksel (2010) using the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) method together with Porter's five forces to determine the sectoral competitiveness level of an organization. In another study conducted using classic ANP, Wu et al. (2012) aimed to develop a model that would allow businesses to evaluate their existing strategies in the context of the most important criteria by integrating ANP and the five forces. Sirikrai and Tang (2006) developed a model to measure industry competitiveness using the AHP method in which they used Porter's five forces as one of four criteria at the third level of the hierarchy in the model. In their study which looked at the external environment as one of the processes in strategic management, Bartuskováa and Kresta (2015) divided the external environment into macro (distant environment) and micro (near environment). They then used the AHP method, in which the macro and micro-environments were taken as the two main criteria. While the distant environment was analyzed using PESTLE analysis, the near environment was analyzed using Porter's five forces. In a study that considered the selection of the best competitive strategy as an MCDM problem, Gholami and Esfahani (2012) presented a model proposal that can jointly perform the analysis of the internal and the external environment for businesses. The study used the FAHP method to analyze both the internal environment and the external environment using two separate hierarchies. In the first hierarchy, Porter's value chain analysis was used for the internal environmental analysis while in the second hierarchy; Porter's five forces were used for the analysis of the external environment. The best competitive strategy alternatives (differentiation, cost leadership, focus) identified at the end of both analyzes were discussed at the end of the study, and a consensus was sought between the priorities obtained from both analyzes.====This study is one of the first studies on IGA. The study fills the gap in the literature on the effects of major structural changes in an air cargo industry on the competition among carriers with the operationalization of an airport. In addition, the study examines new competition conditions post IGA by combining the five-force analysis and competitive strategies put forward by Michael Porter in a fuzzy context. In this regard, the study has a strong and novel approach in terms of the its topic, foundations, methodology, and the suggestions for a new competitive environment to business managers.====The subsequent parts of the paper are as follows.

At present, the uncertainty of the take-off time is one of the major contributions to the loss of trajectory predictability. In the EUROCONTROL Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre, the predicted take-off time for each individual flight relies on the information received from the Enhanced Traffic Flow Management System. However, aircraft do not always take-off at the times reported by this system due to several factors, which effects and interactions are too complex to be expressed with hard-coded rules. Previous work proposed a machine learning model that, based on historical data, was able to predict the take-off time of individual flights from a set of input features that effectively captures some of these elements. The model demonstrated to reduce by 30% the take-off time prediction errors of the current system one hour before the time that flight is scheduled to depart from the parking position. This paper presents an extension of the model, which overcomes this look-ahead time constraint and allows to improve take-off time predictions as early as the initial flight plan is received. In addition, a subset of the original set of input features has been meticulously selected to facilitate the implementation of the solution in an operational air traffic flow and capacity management system, while minimising the loss of predictive power. Finally, the importance and interactions of the input features are thoroughly analysed with additive feature attribution methods.","According to the most likely scenario of the EUROCONTROL’s statistics and forecast service, there will be around 16.2 million flights in Europe in 2040, which corresponds to 57% more traffic than in 2017. This is 1.9% average annual growth per year over the period 2017–2040 (EUROCONTROL, 2018). It should be noted, however, that these predictions were made before the COVID-19 crisis, long-term effects of which may also impact the figures. With traffic demand reaching historic levels and projected to continue growing in the years to come, balancing the demand and the capacity is critically important.====The first step when balancing demand and capacity is to adapt the capacity to the demand, e.g., by modifying the airspace sectorisation. If the demand cannot still be accommodated, measures are applied to adapt the demand to the capacity. These measures include Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations that delay flights on ground (thus creating additional costs to the airspace users) by issuing calculated take-off times (CTOTs), also known as ATFM ====. For these ATFM regulations to be effective and cost-efficient, the predicted traffic demand must be very accurate.====From the air navigation services providers (ANSPs) point of view, the demand is typically expressed in terms of entry counts and/or occupancy counts at the different traffic volumes.==== The entry and occupancy counts are derived from 4D trajectories (three spatial dimensions plus time) computed by trajectory predictors, which make use of flight information such as the planned route, the requested flight level and the estimated take-off time, to predict when and where each aircraft will be in the future. Unfortunately, the lack of detailed, accurate and up-to-date flight information as well as the discrepancy between scheduled and flown trajectories created, for instance, by airport operational uncertainties and air traffic control (ATC) clearances, are significant weaknesses of state-of-the-art trajectory predictors.====In the recent years, the use of historical data and machine learning (ML) has shown potential to improve the accuracy of trajectory predictors. For instance, the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC) has developed an artificial neural network that is able to predict lateral routes within its area of responsibility (Naessens et al., 2017). In contrast to traditional methods for trajectory prediction, which typically rely on kinematic models of the aircraft behaviour and several assumptions about the flight intent, this solution relies on historical data and ML. The solution was deployed into the MUAC’s air traffic flow and capacity management (ATFCM) system in 2018.====The current solution implemented in the MUAC’s ATFCM system is able to predict the lateral routes within the MUAC area of responsibility, but cannot predict the exact entry times, which are essential to compute accurate demand figures. As a matter of fact, when computing the entry and occupancy counts, any delay is a distortion of the trajectory as much as a change of the route. This variability of entry times stems from factors external to MUAC, such as clearances by upstream ATC, general behaviour of aircraft outside MUAC airspace, or take-off time uncertainty at the departure airport. The ML model presented in this paper addresses the latter factor.====At present, the estimated take-off Time (ETOT) of each individual flight is obtained from the Network Manager’s (NM) enhanced tactical flow management system (ETFMS). The ETOT is regularly updated from the submission of the initial flight plan (IFP) to the actual take-off time (ATOT), as new information collected from several sources is available to the ETFMS in real-time. The ETOT included in the ETFMS flight data (EFD) messages (Koolen and Coliban, 2019), however, is subject to several sources of uncertainty and may differ from the ATOT.====MUAC has implemented a method to adjust the ETOTs included in the EFD by evaluating the status of aircraft on the ground (as derived from surveillance data) and keeping track of average taxi-times. This solution improves ETOTs in a narrow 0–20 min horizon prior to take-off, but cannot address longer horizons. As such, the current solution is based on simple statistics, thus it does not unlock the full potential of ML. Previous work (Dalmau et al., 2019) proposed two ML models able to improve the take-off time prediction of individual flights one hour before their estimated off-block time (EOBT)====: gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). The former model predicts the take-off time of individual flights using only the most up-to-date information (departure and arrival airports, airline, hour of the day, visibility at the airport, etc.), whereas the latter takes into account the whole sequence of EFD messages from the submission of the IFP (i.e., its history). Both models were trained on three years of data for flights crossing the MUAC’s area of responsibility, and the quality of their predictions was measured against the take-off time accuracy of the ETOTs included in the EFD. Both models showed similar benefits around 30% when predicting the ETOT one hour before the EOBT.====This paper focuses on the GBDT model from a more practical perspective. First, the model is extended to improve take-off time predictions from the submission of the IFP to the ATOT, including the look-ahead time of the prediction as a new input feature. Then, an optimised subset of the original features presented in Ref. Dalmau et al. (2019) is carefully selected in order to speed-up the deployment in a real-life environment while minimising the loss of predictive power. Last but not least, another contribution of this paper is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the importance and interaction of the selected features (model inputs), aiming to understand the rules beneath the decisions of the model. Being able to explain the decisions of the model gives more trust on its outcomes, allows to figure out how the process being modelled works, and provides intuition on how to improve the results.====This document is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the state-of-the-art on take-off time and departure delay prediction using ML; The current system and the proposed ML solution are described in Sections 3 Current take-off time predictions, 4 Machine learning approach, respectively; the performance of the model and the importance of the different features are thoroughly examined in Section 5; finally, the conclusions of this work and potential future directions for research are discussed in Section 6.",An explainable machine learning approach to improve take-off time predictions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000739,10 June 2021,2021,Research Article,184.0

This disruption has taken many directions, one of which is the demand imbalance which occurs due to the sudden change in the cargo capacity, as well as demand. Therefore, the random change leads to excessive demand in some routes (hot-selling routes), while some other routes suffer from a big shortage of demand (underutilized routes). Routes are substitutable when there are several adjacent airports in the Origin & Destination (O&D) market. In this market, demand imbalance between substitutable routes occurs because of the above reasons. To tackle the demand imbalance problem, a novel model is introduced to estimate the quantity combinations which maintains the balance between underutilized and hot-selling routes. This model is a variant of the classic Cournot model which captures different quantity scenarios in the form of the best response for each route compared to the other. We then cultivate the model by integrating the Puppet Cournot game with the quantity discount policy. The quantity discount policy is an incentive which motivates the freight forwarders to increase their orders in the underutilized routes. After conducting numerical experiments, the results reveal that the profit can increase up to 25% by using the quantity discount. However, the quantity discount model is only applicable when the profit increase in the hot-selling route is greater than the profit decrease in the underutilized route.","Air cargo transportation significantly affects the world economic development by connecting a wide range of cities around the world and facilitating the world trade movement (====). ==== attributes the importance of air cargo transportation to many reasons, including the safe and fast movement of perishable goods, a more humane means for carrying live animals and suitable treatment of high value and weather sensitive products.====). The irregularity in the cargo demand and capacity has caused a complex demand imbalance between the existing capacity and demand. This imbalance intensifies in the O&D market. In the O&D market, the nearby airports are considered substitutable. For example, the competition authorities in UK classified substitutable airports into two classes; first the primary airports such as London, Heathrow and Gatwick. Second, the secondary airports, (e.g. Luton and Stansted)(====). The substitutability between these airports depends on the passengers and freight forwarders' preferences. Therefore, the existence of multiple adjacent airports on the point of origin and on the point of destination forms many substitutable cargo routes. The capacity utilization in these substitutable routes represents a big dilemma to airlines, especially for combination airlines which operate both cargo and passengers' services. This dilemma appears when the demand on certain routes are much higher than other routes or even higher than the routes’ capacity. The demand imbalance is described as the next:====In regular conditions, airlines offer bookings and selling cargo capacity twelve month before a flight departure. Several freight forwarders book or buy cargo space by means of long-term contracts or in spot market sales (====). In the planning stage, and based on the forecasted demand, the airline determines the network capacity and assigns aircraft for each route. After the planning period, carriers usually experience contradictory demand-capacity gaps on different routes. In some routes, the cargo ordered by freight forwarders exceeds the capacity (hot-selling), while in some other routes, the ordered cargo quantities are not sufficient to fill even half of its capacity (underutilized). The Civil Administration of China states that the hot-selling routes represent 24.5 percent of all operating routes, and the underutilized routes represent 33.6 percent of all operating routes (====). The reasons for this imbalance problem are summarized as follows; first, the difference in the trade movement between cities, shown clearly between Asia-North America and Middle East-Europe lanes (====). Second, ==== reported that the increased use of passengers wide-body aircraft leaves more empty space in the belly-hold. This occurs because of the difference between the passengers and cargo traffic which affects the carrier's plan and the route's capacity. Furthermore, combination airlines might also use dedicated freighters (e.g. Emirates, and Singapore airlines). However, this leads to complicated planning operations, especially on the assignment of aircraft (i.e. loading cargo to dedicated freighters or to passengers' belly-hold), and complex terminal operations, and therefore, more expected disruption (====).====As aforementioned, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a great disruption in cargo demand and capacity which also led to demand imbalance between substitutable routes. To deal with the demand imbalance problem, carriers need to estimate the cargo quantities to give better utilization between the hot-selling and the underutilized routes. Then, they need to find incentives to motivate the freight forwarders to follow these pre-planned quantities. However, in the existing literature, the balance between hot-selling and underutilized routes were considered in two aspects; an aspect that segments the freight forwarders according to the ordering size, then the large freight forwarders have a greater chance of getting more cargo space in the hot-selling routes, and the small forwarders are allocated to underutilized routes (====). The other aspect does not consider the hot-selling routes and proposes a solution to fill the unused space in the underutilized routes (e.g. (====; ====). In this regard, we introduce a novel model, that we name the Puppet Cournot game, to estimate the optimum cargo quantities giving a balance between the hot-selling and the underutilized routes.====This game is a variant of the classic Cournot model. The airline is the only player running the game through the classic Cournot model, treating two types of routes; the hot-selling route and the underutilized route. The airline plays the game with complete information to share the pie of the overall profit between the hot-selling and the underutilized routes. Therefore, the airline plays the game twice; once for the hot-selling route to maximize its profit, and the other to maximize the profit of the underutilized route. The aim of this game is to solve the demand imbalance between the two routes and increase the overall profit of the airline. The Puppet Cournot captures different quantity scenarios in the form of the best response for each route with respect to the other. These scenarios are most likely dependent on the market demand of the two routes. In comparison with the traditional Cournot model, the Nash equilibrium of the Puppet Cournot game does not give a symmetrical solution because the demand in the hot-selling route is higher than the demand in the underutilized route. Also, the determined Nash equilibrium point in the Puppet Cournot represents a reverse point in which the routes exchange their roles. In more detail, for Route 1 and 2, hot-selling and underutilized respectively, our approach gives the best response for this condition until reaching the reverse point. After the reverse point, the best response is given for the condition that Route 1 and 2 become underutilized and hot selling respectively.====Although the Puppet Cournot game gives the quantity balance scenarios to the carrier, it does not consider the thirst of freight forwarders for booking cargo space on the hot-selling routes. Consequently, it is necessary to cope with this issue. The quantity discount policy provides the incentive to freight forwarders to follow the quantity plans of the airline. The quantity discount is mainly used to change the buyers ordering quantities and maximize both the profit of seller and buyer. The seller offers a reduction of the unit price when the buyer orders quantity above a certain break point (====).It is found significant to use quantity discount policy as an incentive to motivate freight forwarders to increase their orders in the underutilized route. Therefore, we integrate the Puppet Cournot with the quantity discount in order to estimate the optimal preplanned quantities which satisfies both airline and freight forwarders. The integration of the quantity discount to the Puppet Cournot model follows these assumptions. (1) Each freight forwarder orders a fixed amount from the hot-selling and the underutilized routes. (2) In the imbalance condition, the freight forwarders order from the hot-selling route is greater than the underutilized route. (3) A quantity discount is offered to the freight forwarder who orders more in the underutilized route and reduces the same amount in the hot-selling route.====The contribution of this work can be described as follows: (i) except for (====) who addressed the demand imbalance problem during the booking horizon by using the strategic foreclosure approach, to the best of our knowledge, most of the related research studies in air cargo capacity allocation and management have only dealt with air cargo allocation by doling out each individual route capacity to multiple freight forwarders. The capacity allocation between the hot-selling and underutilized routes has not been fully considered. In our research, we propose a different capacity allocation solution between two routes. Our approach treats the airline as the puppeteer who controls the Cournot game in order to adjust the quantities in the hot-selling and the underutilized routes. Consequently, the Puppet Cournot model is firstly introduced in this paper. The value of the Puppet Cournot model stems from the quantity scenarios which fix the imbalance between the underutilized and the hot-selling routes. (ii) although quantity discount is used in several applications, it has not received much attention in transportation practice. Also, as far as we know, it has not been used in air cargo research. Therefore, the integration between the Puppet Cournot model and the quantity discount policy provides an important scientific contribution. To summarize, this work contributes in designing a proactive capacity allocation plan to avoid demand imbalance. Finally, it is worthwhile to note that our model resembles ==== which refers to the elevated competition among airlines in the substitutable routes.====To summarize, air cargo industry represented in the top management of combination carriers can undertake the Puppet Cournot duopoly game. The application of this game necessitates the airline to collect the historical records of the demand in the hot-selling and the underutilized routes. Also, the cost function of each route is necessary to estimate the best quantity responses. Moreover, the game results imply that the market is split between the two routes. In other words, the Puppet Cournot game model divides the overall demand of the airline between the hot-selling route and the underutilized route. The results give the best quantity scenarios in each route, and hence solve the imbalance problem at any circumstance even after the COVID-19.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In 2019, China's airline market traffic reached 1.29 billion passengers and 1.2 trillion revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) (====).====However, in 2020, COVID-19 disrupted global economic development. Similar to SARS, COVID-19 is an airborne disease that can spread rapidly in populations (====). On January 30, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). On March 11, 2020, the WHO Director, Dr. Ghebreyesus, declared that COVID-19 constituted a global pandemic.====The COVID-19 outbreak has hit many industries, especially the aviation market. Both the number of flights and passengers has dropped significantly. The GDP of the global economy is expected to shrink by 3%, which is worse than the contraction caused by the financial crisis in 2008–2009 (====). In comparison, the volume of global merchandise trade decreases by 13–32%. 2020 saw a US$330 billion and US$59 billion decrease in the international travel market, largely due to travel restrictions imposed in nearly 96% of destinations (====).====Many scholars have conducted studies on the relationship between the pandemic and civil aviation from two main aspects.==== The first aspect is the inhibitory effect of the occurrence of the pandemic on traffic. For example, ==== analyzed the dramatic implications for global passenger traffic. ==== focused on older passengers (65+) who were severely affected by COVID-19. The study shows that a significant proportion of older passengers still plan to travel by air in the next year, however, their travel patterns may change, with fewer trips than before, more domestic trips, and more trips by different modes of transport. In particular, the shift from public transport to cars (especially in Korea and China) exceeded 60%. ==== reviewed the airline traffic changes around the world and focused more on the Chinese market. They suggested that China's airline domestic market traffic rebounded very fast because of the strict pandemic control. Most countries adopted the “curve flattening” strategy to combat the pandemic, leading to a slow recovery in airline traffic. ==== found through their study that the pandemic led to a greater shift in travel from public transportation to cars, such that many short-haul air travels are substituted by driving. ==== conducted a comprehensive empirical analysis on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the air transportation system through multi-grain network analysis. The authors found that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international flights was much greater than that on domestic flights and the southern hemisphere was more affected than the northern hemisphere. ==== reviewed the adverse impact of the pandemic on airlines' financial conditions, and also suggested potential recovery pathways for global airline industries. ==== examined the impact of COVID-19 on airport operating procedures and found the most obvious difference was the enhanced procedures for verifying the health status of passengers. ==== built an intergrated economic model to examine how the previous international flight slots can be reallocated to the domestic routes at the hub airports. They analyzed the market competition and airline strategy changes with such airport slot reallocation.====The second stream of literature focuses on how airline travel can contribute to the spread of the virus. ==== quantified the imported risk of COVID-19 faced by African countries by studying their international connectivity with China. ==== calibrated the random transmission model of COVID-19 to predict the spread of the virus in China by using the population outflow of different modes of transportation (e.g., air, rail, and coach) from Wuhan to other regions of China. ==== assessed the role of the air travel ban in containing the pandemic and found that the air travel ban significantly slowed the spread of COVID-19 in China. ==== applied the global population transmission model to predict the impact of Wuhan lockdown on curbing the spread of the virus. They noted that the embargo would only delay the development of the outbreak in China by 3–5 days, while international travel restrictions would more effectively help delay the spread of the outbreak from China to the rest of the world. ==== compared the effects of different modes of transportation on the spread of COVID-19 in China. They found that air transport was more strongly associated with virus transmission than high-speed trains. ==== proposed a method to integrate the real-time global flight information and pandemic data to calculate the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 via international air transport. The method is applied to the Chinese contexts to calculate the COVID-19 import risk for particular Chinese provinces and some important international routes.====Unlike the previous studies that focused on aggregated airline traffic flow or airline/airport operations, this paper examines how the pandemic affects airline passenger-specific travel behaviors in the context of the Chinese airline market.==== For example, airline passengers would change their ticket booking and airport dwell time in response to the infection risk and changes of airline/airport operations.

Air transport has played a pivotal role in its expeditious transmission.====A number of papers have researched aviation system disruptions, even though the overall assessment of such events could arguably have gone further (e.g. see ====). ==== measured the economic consequences of terrorist attacks, ==== analysed the traffic effects of terrorist attacks in Europe, ==== investigated the effects of airline disasters on aviation stocks and ====, ==== and ==== researched the impact of influenza outbreaks, ==== examined the impact of pandemic outbreaks on airport businesses and ==== studied the impact of SARS on airlines.

Through topological analysis and probability analysis, we investigate the characterization of delay propagation among airports and the impact of different types of airports on delay propagation. Results indicate that the cumulative degree distribution of the delay propagation network follows an exponential function and flight delays take at most one transhipment to go from each airport to any other airports on average. For each individual airport, the effects of delay propagation are associated with airports size (traffic flow), small airports are easily affected by other airports while large airports are more affecting downstream airports but fewer affected by upstream airports. Finally, we show how the number of affected airports changes as a function of the delayed airports based on different simulation strategies.","Air traffic delay is an important problem in the United States and results in large economic losses. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) reported that about 20% of the commercial flights were delayed from 2010 to 2018 in the US. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimated the annual costs of delays in 2019 to be $33 billion (Federal Aviation FAAFederal Aviation Administration, 2019).====Flight delays impact the operation of airports and airlines, and bring inconvenience to passengers which increases airlines' cost, and loses the passenger's loyalty (Vlachos and Lin, 2014). Flight delays also have negative impacts on air transport system, which will throw initial flight plans into disarray and reduce efficiency (Joint Economic Committee report, 2008). An initial flight delay can be attributed to extreme weather, air carrier issues, air traffic control, etc. (BTS report, 2017). However, the connected resources in the air traffic network, such as aircrafts, crew members and passengers, result in the propagation of flight delays (Jetzki 2009; Kafle and Zou, 2016). In order to maximize aircraft utilization, airlines usually reduce the time buffer between arrival and departure flights which also increases the probability of delay propagation in air traffic network (AhmadBeygi et al., 2018). For those reasons, a small initial delay may lead to larger delays later in the day and results in much worse situation (Li et al., 2014). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of delay propagation in air traffic system is important yet challenging.====From delay propagation at system-level perspective, there are two critical challenges that need to be considered. First, delay propagation in flights can be monitored by tracking connected resources-mainly aircraft tail number. However, delay propagation among airports is complex, because the airport runs a large number of flights connecting with much other airports every day. Therefore, the target airport delay is the combined effects of potential upstream airport delays. For instance, considering two flight legs ==== and ====, due to the connections in the air traffic network, flight delays in ATL and JFW could propagate to ORD. That is, flight delays in airport ORD will be affected by airports ATL and JFW. However, existing researches in studying delay propagation among airports mainly considering the correlation between origin-destination pairs, but rarely considering such combined effects. For instance, Zanin (2015); Zanin et al. (2017) and Du et al. (2018) build a delay propagation network using the pairwise Granger causality test, that is, assessing the delay correlation of each origin-destination pair. If the p-value was less than 5%, they connected the two airports with a directed edge. Second, the current approaches can provide a relatively deep understanding of the topological characteristics of the delay propagation, such as the shortest path of delay propagation (Abdelghany et al., 2004); the largest connected cluster of the delay propagation network (Du et al., 2018); the importance of the airports or the flight routes (Barrat et al., 2004; Guimera et al., 2005) or the comparison of the delay propagation network structures in different countries (Campanelli et al., 2016). However, few researches explored the impacts of delayed airports on others, such as the influence of upstream delays on downstream airports and what was the extent of delay propagation if airports that were highly ranked for different metrics, such as traffic flows, occurs delay. For example, network topology analysis could determine the importance of each airport or route in the delay propagation network, however, it is different to identify the influence of the critical airports on others. Such as how much other airports will be affected if the critical airports are delayed?====This study addresses the above challenges and can be distinguished from the existing literatures in following aspects. First, we assume that the flight delays in individual airport are the joint influence of potential upstream delays. Therefore, we apply a Bayesian Network (BN) approach to capture the conditional dependence relationships of flight delays and build a delay propagation network among the major 100 airports in the US. Following complex network theory, we study the topological characteristics of the delay propagation network, identify the degree distribution of the network, explore the importance of each airport and route and investigate the shortest path of delay propagation. Second, we evaluate the impact of upstream delay on downstream airport by using the posterior probability calculated by the BN model. Moreover, in order to identify the influence of delayed airports on others, we compare four simulation strategies that recursively assumes the airport with the highest value of the index occurs delay, ((i) traffic flow (ranking with descending), (ii) traffic flow (ranking with ascending), (iii) degree and (iv) betweenness centrality) and use the affected and unaffected number of airports to measure the extend of propagation.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related studies on flight delay prediction in the literature. Section 3 provides detailed information about the data set and the related methodologies, including the BN model, construction of the delay propagation network, and network analysis. Section 4 proposes the constructed delay propagation network and validates its performance. Section 5 focuses on the topological analysis of the delay propagation network and accesses the impact of different airport types on delay propagation.

We find that these algorithms are able to capture the diurnal trends in the surface traffic, and all do very well when predicting the next 30 minutes of demand. Longer forecast horizons are moderately effective, demonstrating the challenge of this problem and highlighting promising techniques as well as potential areas for improvement.====Traffic demand is not the only factor that contributes to terminal congestion, because temporary changes to the ","Mobility technologies are transforming the way we live and do business. Nowhere is this more evident than in the multi-modal transportation hubs–primarily airports–that connect people and move goods around the world. The increased use of smart mobility technologies at transportation hubs holds the promise of providing consumers and businesses with many benefits including increased convenience, efficiency, and resilience. However, the challenges of adapting complex transportation networks to rapidly evolving technology trends are significant; Non-optimal planning and/or execution may result in increased energy consumption, costs, and system inefficiencies.====To support this research, we have developed a partnership with Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (====), the nation's first carbon-neutral airport, which is simultaneously positioned in the urban region of greatest population growth (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018). DFW is the fourth busiest airport in the world by aircraft movements (takeoffs and landings) and has service to 249 destinations, including 62 international and 187 domestic destinations. The airport served a record ==== passengers in 2018. There are approximately ==== people that work at DFW, including airport employees, concessionaires, and others. Meanwhile, air traffic is forecast to double in the next 20 years, and DFW is committed to responding to this increase in demand by growing its capacity.====In this work, we developed an operational model for airport passenger traffic by combining traffic demand forecasting with traffic microsimulation as depicted in Fig. 1. To accomplish this, (1) we predict traffic volume into the airport, and (2) we use traffic microsimulation to distribute the predicted traffic volume obtained from the first task to the airport road network. The microsimulation model represents traffic by simulating the behavior and interaction of individual vehicles. It is designed both for real-time forecasting of traffic conditions and long-term infrastructure planning. A predictive demand forecast model can assist in responding to peaks and valleys in traffic that may impact operations and security, as well as provide a platform for experimentation with the airport infrastructure and exploration of impacts in terms of fuel use, emissions, revenue, and delays. We have designed and evaluated this model with the specific task of capturing traffic and congestion at the terminal curbside in order to better understand why and where traffic events occur and how they may best be mitigated. The developed model is generalized so that it may be applied to any airport central terminal area (CTA) having basic observability of historic traffic ingress and egress, flight schedules, and weather.====Traffic flow prediction specific to airport region has rarely been studied in the literature. Davidson et al. (1969) predicted the traffic flow in and out of the airport by using unit effect graphs to generate the distribution of the number of passengers arriving at and leaving the airport according to flight schedules. Later researchers used similar approaches to generate traffic demand at the airport, then applied discrete event simulations to further analyze curbside traffic congestion (Burgsteden et al., 2000; Tunasar et al., 1998). Traffic prediction in general urban settings has been widely explored in literature, and abundant prediction algorithms have been discussed, from heuristics-based naïve approaches, such as historical averaging (Nikovski et al., 2005; Park and Rilett, 1617) and clustering (Weijermars and Berkum, 2005; Wild, 1997), to various parametric and non-parametric approaches (Van Hinsbergen et al., 2007). Due to the limited work on airport-specific traffic modeling, we have also investigated a broad class of methods suitable for modeling and predicting traffic and timeseries dynamics in general.====The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been broadly applied in analyzing time-series data. After its first application in traffic prediction by Hamed and Al-Masaeid (Hamed Mohammad et al., 1995), various versions of ARIMA have been explored: seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) that incorporates the seasonality of the time series data has been proved to generate more accurate predictions but demands much higher computational cost (Williams and Hoel, 2003); ARIMA with regressors (ARIMAX) can incorporate covariates to improve prediction accuracy (Williams, 2001); as a less-costly alternative of SARIMA, the combination of Kohonen maps and ARIMA (KARIMA) uses clustering to measure seasonality then applies ARIMA for each cluster (Van Der Voort et al., 1996); and (Tran et al., 2015) combined SARIMA with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) algorithm to capture the volatility of traffic flow. Some other traffic flow modeling algorithms are also essentially derived from or applications of ARIMA, such as seasonal Holt Winter's model (Raikwar et al., 2017), exponential smoothing (O'Mahony et al., 2005), and ATHENA (Danech-Pajouh, 1991; Kirby et al., 1997).====Non-parametric models have also been used for traffic flow prediction, such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) (Vlahogianni et al., 2004; Smith, 1995) found that a simple implementation of KNN sometimes generates reasonably good traffic volume prediction, but it usually requires a lot of data. It has been shown that the prediction accuracy of SVR usually is not as good as SARIMA for traffic prediction as it does not address seasonality properly (Vlahogianni et al., 2014), but seasonal SVR, which introduces a seasonal kernel for SVR, is a competitive alternative when performing forecasts during the most congested periods with significantly less computational cost than SARIMA (Lippi et al., 2013). The combination of SVR and denoising algorithms is proved to help improve prediction accuracy of SVR for some practices (Hong, 2012; Tang et al., 2019). Different versions of ANN have been explored for traffic flow prediction (Do et al., 2019), among which recurrent neural networks (RNN), especially long short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM), has proven to be able to capture both the long-term trend and also the seasonality of traffic flow and in many cases to offer more desirable prediction accuracy than ARIMA and SVR models (Ali and Mahmood, 2018; Kang et al., 2017; Tian and Pan, 2015; Yang et al., 2019), but it usually requires a lot of data for model training (Do et al., 2019). The DeepAR (Salinas et al., 2020) implementation we evaluate in this paper represents this state-of-the-art LSTM-based autoregressive RNN.====The above methods focus on a one dimensional, or univariate, forecast. As of late, additional efficiencies have been discovered and utilized in the traffic prediction domain when working with multiple streams of data (Wu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017). These graph-based methods make use of the topology of the network associated with the road sensors and are able to produce even more effective models than when utilizing multiple independent univariate forecasts. The traffic data provided by DFW for this research is observed in two locations, but we combine this into a single stream of inflow demand, because we are actually interested in the traffic volume within the CTA. Future work may consider these multivariate methods if more detailed data is provided at a larger number of locations.====Traffic flow prediction based on historical data using the aforementioned approaches is usually suitable for short-term prediction, as in forecasting of the next time period, usually no more than 30 min. However, for long-term prediction, as in forecasting of the following day, week, or even longer, some models can suffer from error propagation (Su et al., 2016). Transportation agencies demand traffic prediction models that are robust for both short-term and long-term predictions and sensitive to weather conditions and special holidays (Vlahogianni et al., 2014; Su et al., 2016) described a method called Functional Non-parametric Regression (FNR) and showed that FNR provides superior prediction accuracy than SARIMA, neural networks (NN), and SVR for long-term predictions. The forecasting framework Prophet, which appeared recently in the literature, generates decomposition of time series data and is shown to be able to reflect trend better than SARIMA and BPNN (Taylor and Letham, 2017). In this work, we evaluate the most promising of these approaches in their efficacy at forecasting CTA traffic in comparison to a baseline.====As mentioned previously, traffic volume is only one of many factors that impact traffic congestion. In order to understand how traffic demand may practically impact airport operations, we utilize traffic microsimulation. Prior microsimulations for airport traffic mostly use proprietary microscopic simulation software (Harris et al., 2017) including Leigh Fisher Associates Curbside Traffic Simulation (LFACTS) model (Duncan and Johnson, 2000), Advanced Land Transportation Performance Simulation (ALPS) (Kimley-Horn and A. Inc, 2019), Terminal, Roadway, and Curbside Simulation (TRACS) (Hargrove and Miller, 2002), and VISSIM (Fellendorf and Vortisch, 2010). In this work, we chose to use the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) microsimulator (Behrisch et al., 2011), an open source simulator, to enable our modeling to be replicated for other airports without requiring access to proprietary and generally expensive simulators. SUMO was previously used to model airports’ ground public transportation, including buses and trains, for a multi-airport region (Noyer et al., 2018). In contrast, our SUMO model focuses on simulating traffic created by personal vehicles in and out of the DFW airport.",A data-driven operational model for traffic at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000442,18 May 2021,2021,Research Article,191.0

In the second step, we inspect the drivers of the plunge in air travel demand since the pandemic began, differentiating markets by their predicted social inclusion intensity.

The coronavirus crisis has brought relevant challenges to each of these firms as the traditional passenger segment has changed its purchasing behavior, with business travelers swapping trips for videoconferencing. In this context, in which market segments has the current crisis most impacted non-business passengers’ demand? The markets in which non-business passengers strongly participate are usually those related to tourism and the regions marked by greater social inclusion over the past decades.====Our econometric methodology for identifying markets characterized by greater social inclusion in the Brazilian air transportation industry allows us to quantify the drivers of the pandemic's short-term demand shrinkage throughout 2020, to estimate the demand evolution for the coming years, and to figure out the airlines' attendant business model's needs for adjustment. This methodological framework employs indicators that capture income distribution, credit availability, and internet access at the local level as proxies for social, financial, and digital inclusion factors in the industry, allowing us thereby to estimate their impacts on air travel. We contribute to the literature by carrying out an empirical analysis of the determinants of the sharp drop in demand for air travel since the pandemic began by differentiating the markets according to their estimated intensity of social inclusion.

Especially in China, Chinese airlines just started charging ancillary services in recent years, so ancillary pricing can lead to huge profit opportunities and should be supplemented to the revenue management system.====Ancillary revenue contributes a lot to airline profits, which would greatly reduce the financial pressure of airline operations. In recent years, because of the slow growth of global air passenger demand, ancillary services have become the new comparative advantage in air passenger transportation. The growth rate of global air passenger demand (calculated by revenue passenger kilometers) was 4.2% in 2019, which declined compared with that in 2020 and was below 5.5% for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009 (IATA, 2019). At the same time, the spread of COVID-19 has caused a huge impact on the global aviation industry, which made the market demand decreased sharply. A large number of flights have been shut down, and airline companies had tremendous pressure in operating cash flow. It will take a long time for airlines to recover from the outbreak.====Developing ancillary services has become a very important source of increasing airline revenue. Air China transported 110 million passengers in 2018 with a yearly increase of 8.02%, and the operating income was approximately $19.5 billion with a yearly increase of 12.67%. Compared with the same period, the operating cost increased from $14.3 billion to $16.4 billion with an increase of 14.82% (Air China, 2019). The growth rate of cost is relatively fast and further compresses the profit, so it is necessary to find new ways for profit growth. Moreover, the products provided by airlines are becoming more and more homogeneous from the perspective of fares, cabin layout, and seat comfort. Product innovation is a major challenge for airlines in attracting customers. Therefore, developing ancillary services not only provides a personalized product system to obtain differentiation advantages but also creates extra revenue for airlines to obtain profit growth. From 2007 to 2018, the ancillary revenue of the top ten airlines increased from $2.1 billion to $35.2 billion with an increase of nearly 17 times (IdeaWorksCompany, 2019).====Moreover, complex and diversified traveling demands are emerging quickly. The passengers of “unique needs and tastes” gradually replaced the traditional passengers. European and American airlines have already applied unbundled pricing of ancillary services. Chinese airlines developed ancillary services later, only some of them have unbundled ancillary services on certain flights, most of which are long-distance flights. However, these airlines lack a pricing system for ancillary services and struggle at perceiving consumer willingness when changing the price.====The pricing of ancillary services would follow the same trend as ticket fares. At present, ticket pricing is changing dynamically, which is different from the fixed price in the past. The frequency of price updating has been increasing, which made periodically updated pricing changes transfer to the differentiated pricing. In other words, the passive moves of price adjustment change into actively analyzing the market demand.====This paper gives an analysis of different ancillary services based on the choice behavior of passengers and proposes a dynamic pricing model with the predicted choice probability. Based on the real market data from a Chinese domestic flight, it comes out with a pricing strategy to maximize the flight revenue of ancillary services, which would supplement ancillary revenue management and become theoretical support of ancillary pricing. The quantification of WTP and prediction of passenger demand will also improve the competence in the market.====This paper firstly overviewed the literature on ancillary services provided by Chinese and non-Chinese airlines and summarized typical ancillary services and major factors. Secondly, the binary logistic regression was used to predict the probability of passenger choice on different products at different prices. Thirdly, the choice probability and the ancillary revenue model can help obtain the prices for maximizing the ancillary revenue. In the analysis, the model was based on historical data of the flight and passengers, which was verified by the increase in revenue and provides new ideas for the dynamic pricing of ancillary products.",Dynamic pricing of ancillary services based on passenger choice behavior,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000417,6 May 2021,2021,Research Article,193.0

This is potentially due to the comparatively short duration and regionalised nature of these past pandemics and the rapid recovery of the aviation industry. In comparison, the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in its duration, global effects and long-term recovery forecast (====). In the support of positive industry outcomes, tertiary institutions have a responsibility to ensure their course offerings remain abreast of current changes within industries (====, p. 4). Considering the significant impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the aviation industry, universities offering undergraduate aviation degrees need to play a vital role in helping graduates manage the associated career shock and adapt their programs accordingly to better prepare graduates for the significant challenges of the changing industry.====The aim of this research is to examine the skills that students in current Australian undergraduate tertiary aviation programs consider to be beneficial in meeting their skill development and future career needs as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation industry. By developing an understanding of the skills students perceive to be necessary for their careers following the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons can be drawn with industry perspectives to determine whether these viewpoints align and, more importantly, support student's successful development of skills as sought by the industry (====). The research seeks to answer the following research questions:====RQ1. What are the perceived impediments that are likely to impact on the ==== of current Australian aviation tertiary students?====RQ2. What additional skill sets do Australian aviation tertiary students perceive to be valuable for future careers in the aviation industry?====RQ3. What study and ==== strategies are current Australian aviation tertiary students contemplating post-graduation?====RQ4. From a student perspective, how can universities prepare Australian aviation tertiary students in the knowledge, understanding and skill requirements necessary in the post-COVID-19 industry?====These sub-questions will facilitate the collection of comprehensive data to gain an in-depth understanding of how aviation students perceive their skill development needs and future career opportunities within the post-COVID-19 industry. In the interests of supporting positive industry outcomes, the questions also aim to investigate how universities can support students in developing any additional skills or exploring alternative career paths.",The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on current tertiary aviation education and future careers: Students’ perspective,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000648,4 May 2021,2021,Research Article,195.0

The number of scheduled airline flights worldwide decreased by 47.5% by August 2020 (====; ====). In an attempt to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a plethora of research into the effects this crisis is having on the global aviation industry is necessary if not vital to support future operations (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Flying was a fun and unique experience for many people, and research has shown that this is reflective in impulse shopping within the terminals (====; ====; ====). The airlines have responded to this dramatic reduction in demand by grounding significant portions of their fleets and furloughing aircrews and support personnel. One recent study found that the valuation of hotels, airlines, cruise lines, and car rental companies has decreased substantially due to the pandemic.====Understanding the emotional response to travel during a global pandemic may strengthen aviation industry practices that minimize the risk of transmission of common illnesses (such as influenza) and the next pandemic. Some passengers who travel frequently no longer perceive flying as unique and fun, leading to a perceived decrease in valuation. This effect, coupled with passengers' changing preferences (====; ====), is substantial enough to raise concerns about the long-term health of the travel industry (====; ====; ====; ====). Passenger concerns have been found to range in magnitude from slightly concerned to highly fearful and anxious about being close to others (====), especially in airports and on aircraft. Fear and anxiety drive decisions that may cause passengers to either cancel plans or develop alternative travel methods (====, a personal car). Moreover, some social and business meetings can be accomplished with videoconferencing and are learning techniques for improving this technology's performance (====; ====). The effects of the pandemic on the global aviation industry are not yet fully understood, and additional research is necessary to create a strategy to help the airlines recover (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). This study aims to enhance our understanding of peoples' emotional response to the pandemic. This information may help airlines and other segments of the industry to develop policies and guide messaging that encourages the resumption of travel. The scope of this study included asking five general, and reflective questions about what the participants were concerned most about flying during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The questions did not specifically direct questions onto any specific element of the travel process (such as going through security, catching an Uber, or standing in the boarding line), so as not to lead the participant. The researchers hypothesized that people would have concerns about multiple facets of air travel and wanted these to emerge from participant answers. The researchers anticipated that people considering travel experience uncertainty related to trust, loss of control, and vulnerability.====The following is/are the supplementary data to this article:",A qualitative analysis of social and emotional perspectives of airline passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000624,4 May 2021,2021,Research Article,196.0

To achieve this objective, we propose an optimization model that generates optimal airport shuttle routes for a given set of constraints and a discrete-event simulator that evaluates the optimal shuttle routes in a stochastic environment to understand the tradeoffs between the amount of time passengers wait for shuttles, and shuttle energy consumption. The proposed optimization model and stochastic simulation are tested using shuttle route data provided by the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. Results indicate that optimized routes can lead to a 20% energy reduction in shuttle operations with a modest 2-min increase in average shuttle wait times. The optimization model and simulator presented here are designed to be generalizable and can be adapted to optimize shuttle operations at any major airport.","Airports, like Dallas Fort Worth International (DFW),==== are considered ‘special generators’ since a considerable portion of any cities' traffic originates or terminates at an airport. Understandably, air travel holds a major stake in long-distance travel, particularly for trips greater than 1000 miles from the point of origin (Bureau of Transportation, 2017). With air travel on the rise in pre-COVID times (Henao et al., 2018) and seeing a steady growth as travel is slowly returning to a new normal in light of the pandemic (Chokshi, 2020), it is reasonable to expect continued growth in passenger traffic to airports. Airport planning and operations focus on bridging the gap between a passenger reaching the airport and taking flight. Aspects of airport planning and operations span ensuring reliable ground access to airports (Malandri et al., 2017), ease of baggage handling (Budd et al., 2014), curb management, and infrastructure planning, not to mention the myriad airside operations. One such aspect of airport operations is transporting passengers to and from airport parking lots or rental car centers to the terminals. Within airport shuttle buses account for a considerable portion of the energy expenditure and emissions (that are within the control of the airport operators) at the airport. For example, the rental car shuttle fleet at DFW uses over 693,000 gasoline gallons equivalent (GGE) of compressed natural gas (CNG) and generates 5700 tons of CO==== each year (Kotz et al., 2020). Therefore, optimizing within airport shuttle routes to minimize energy consumption, could increase the mobility and energy efficiency of airport ground transport operations.====A passenger's experience in accessing an airport can be broken down into three mutually exclusive portions. The first part is airport ground access (labeled ‘travel to/from the airport’), i.e., accessing an airport from anywhere in the city. Passenger experience for this leg of the airport trip is influenced by factors such as reliability of ground access (Malandri et al., 2017), ease of baggage handling (Budd et al., 2014), cost of airport access (Jou et al., 2011), or level of safety and security in ground access modes (Budd et al., 2016). The second part is terminal access (labeled ‘travel within the airport premises’), that is travel from rental car center or parking facilities to the terminal. However, passengers must wait for some amount of time, and travel in these shuttles for a few minutes to reach the terminal. So, time can be an influencing factor in passenger travel experience. The final part is gate access (labeled ‘travel inside the terminal). Aspects that affect passenger experience in this part of the airport trip are wait time at the ticketing counters, security wait time, and wait time at the gates. Aspects of ‘travel to the airport’ (such a transit fares), and ‘travel in the terminal’ (such as wait time at the ticketing counters) legs of the airport journey are often not in the control of airport authorities, making it difficult to address all the factors noted above using a unified optimization framework. This work intends to focus on the aspects that airport authorities do have control over, hence aspects of passenger ‘travel’ experience within the airport premises' are chosen as the topic of research. In particular, the research effort aims to optimize airport shuttle operations with shuttle wait times and in-vehicle travel times as the indicators for passenger travel experience. We believe that the solutions proposed from this research are both easy to implement and are well within the purview of an airport operation team's authority. A naïve solution to improve passenger travel experience (i.e., minimize shuttle wait times and ride times) would be to increase the number of airport shuttles; analogously, electrification of the airport's shuttle fleet would reduce an airports energy footprint. However, increasing the number of shuttles to minimize passenger wait times is a sub-optimal and expensive solution, and electrifying an airport's shuttle fleet requires large capital investments. By leveraging the power of data, modeling, and simulation, airport authorities can optimize existing shuttle operations for energy efficiency and passenger satisfaction.====Bus schedule and route optimization falls under the category of vehicle routing problems (VRP) where passengers with different origins and destinations are grouped to be served using a single vehicle. There is a wealth of literature on this topic both in the context of traditional transit route optimization (Zhao and Zeng, 2008; Yu et al., 2012), as well as taxi (Nunes et al., 2011), and ride hailing route optimization (Feng et al., 2014). However, the application of VRP in the context of airport shuttle route optimization is relatively sparse (Bao et al., 2018; Linqing et al., 2019), and research focusing on simultaneously tackling travel experience and energy/emission outcomes through vehicle routing is even sparser (Pei-Ying et al., 2013). One unique characteristic of the rental car center shuttle bus service at an airport is that the origin and destination pair can only be terminals and rental car center or rental car center and terminals. This characteristic allows us to better model the optimization and simulation problem with the existing data sources that are available through the airports. This paper adds to the limited literature on airport shuttle route optimization with customer satisfaction, and energy reduction handled simultaneously. This paper stands out from most of the existing literature on VRP and airport shuttle route optimization in that it is not a purely academic exercise. The problem identified in this paper is part of an ongoing collaboration between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Utilizing data from DFW, this research develops generic, open-source tools that any airport can use for within airport shuttle operations planning.====For context, DFW is the fourth busiest airport in the world, with a record setting annual passenger traffic of 75 million passengers in 2019 (Dallas Fort Worth Airport, 2020a). DFW is also the world's largest airport to achieve a carbon neutral status (Dallas Fort Worth Airport, 2020b). Air travel took a major hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as many airports, DFW saw a 90% decrease in passenger traffic in March, and April 2020 (Brian New, 2020). As air travel resumes with enhanced safety measures, DFW has seen a faster increase in flight and passenger volumes compared to other airports and became the busiest airport in the world in May 2020 (Arnold, 2020). As the world heals from the pandemic, becoming more resilient and prepared for coming back to a ‘new normal’, DFW could see a continued rise in air travelers in the months and years to come. Though COVID-19 as a special use case is definitely of interest, much of the work presented in this paper was carried out before the onset of the pandemic, and uses data from typical passenger traffic observed at DFW from December 2019 to February 2020. We note however, that the methodology presented in this paper is valid for newer data and could be used on data collected after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.====This paper proposes an optimization model combined with a discrete event simulator, to solve the ‘travel within the airport premises’ shuttle route optimization problem and explore tradeoffs between passenger wait times, and energy efficiency of transporting passengers between the rental car center and the terminals at DFW. These efforts focus on the rental car center shuttle operations due to their significant measured energy expenditure and miles driven relative to other routes, however the work described here could be adapted to other multi-stop shuttle routes. Data used in this study comes directly from data loggers installed on the airport shuttles, as well as spatial positioning on transit data provided by DFW (Transit, 2020). The optimization model is run with various combinations of constraints on shuttle headways, maximum passenger ride times, and passenger arrival rates. The discrete-event simulator takes the optimal solution for each scenario generated by the optimization model and simulates DFW shuttle operations using that solution for a period of four weeks to generate passenger wait time and energy consumption outputs. Results from the optimization model and the discrete-event simulator provides airport authorities with shuttle routes that simulations indicate will lead to a net saving in energy, while still providing a quality passenger travel experience.",Route optimization for energy efficient airport shuttle operations – A case study from Dallas Fort worth International Airport,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000600,3 May 2021,2021,Research Article,197.0

Therefore, some passengers need to change aircraft and airlines to fly from their origin to their final destination. The present study captures ==== problems in terms of double marginalization but goes one step further by incorporating network choices. The model involves a two-stage game with two carriers who choose their complementary networks in the first stage and fares in the second stage. Each carrier's network involves one or two links that are distributed geographically or distributed in time. If both carriers maintain two links, then transfer passengers can choose between two alternative connections which they consider as imperfect substitutes. There are only transfer passengers, and maintaining a link is costly. The analysis reveals that carrier collaboration and antitrust immunity can eliminate double marginalization and create incentives to extend networks. Our results indicate that the scope for the improvement of carrier networks via antritrust immunity can be rather limited relative to the social desirability of more extensive carrier networks. A possible policy lesson is that airlines should be granted antitrust immunity conditional on network expansion and/or frequency obligations.","Airlines provide complex networks of flight links that are to large extents complementary. One reason for the complementarity is related to bilateral service agreements, which restrict the carriers’ access to the national air space of foreign countries and their airports (for example, Czerny and Lang, 2019). Another reason are flight distances. If the flight distance is too long for a non-stop flight, the connection must be split into a combination of shorter flights. For instance, a flight from Australia or South America to Europe may be too long to fly non-stop. In this case, one flight could be operated by an Australian or South American airline, respectively, whereas the other flight could be operated by a European airline. Consider a passenger who wishes to fly from Sydney to Helsinki. This passenger may fly with Qantas from Sydney to Hong Kong, Singapore or Dubai and from there to Helsinki with Finnair. The complementarity implies that some passengers need to interline in the sense that they must change aircraft and carrier to fly from their origin to their final destination. Such complementarity raises the issue of a “chain of non-integrated concerns” as was highlighted by Spengler (1950). As a result, uncoordinated airline pricing leads to excessive fares via double marginalization (for example, Brueckner and Whalen, 2000).====Different forms of airline collaborations are common including codesharing and airline alliances (for example, Zhang and Czerny, 2012; Bilotkach, 2019). In the case of codesharing, airlines team up to jointly sell each others’ seat capacities. Airline alliances go beyond the collaborative sale of seat capacity and also include other arrangements such as frequent flier program partnerships. Importantly for the present study, partner airlines are sometimes granted with antitrust immunity allowing them to jointly set fares to interline passengers so that double marginalization can be avoided.====The present study captures pricing problems in terms of double marginalization but goes one step further by incorporating scheduling problems in the form of route developments and/or frequency choices. The model involves a two-stage game with two carriers who choose their complementary networks in the first stage and fares in the second stage. Each carrier's network involves one or two links that are distributed geographically or distributed in time. If both carriers maintain two links, then transfer passengers can choose between two alternative connections which they consider as imperfect substitutes. There are only transfer passengers in the model, that is, non-stop passengers are absent. Maintaining a link is costly.====The study develops detailed insights on the relationship between carrier networks and the substitutability of the two alternative connections determined by a ==== which is part of the standard Dixit (1979) type of utility function. The analysis reveals that carrier collaboration and antitrust immunity can not only eliminate double marginalization but can further enhance the incentives to maintain two connections for interline passengers rather than one connection, both of which increases social welfare, depending on the value of the differentiation parameter.====To see that differentiation matters, consider the case of connections that are considered as perfect substitutes by interline passengers. In this case, maintaining two links can never, that is, neither for a profit-maximizing carrier nor for a welfare-maximizing carrier, be optimal because it increases maintenance costs without creating additional demands and benefits, respectively. The critical level of differentiation between routes that needs to be reached so that independent carriers would maintain two links in (the subgame-perfect) equilibrium is, however, higher than the corresponding level for collaborating carriers with antitrust immunity. In this sense, collaboration can create stronger incentives to maintain two connections for interline passengers. However, analytical results indicate that the scope for the improvement of carrier networks by collaboration and antitrust immunity can be rather limited relative to the social desirability of more complete carrier networks. This is because neither independent nor allied carriers consider consumer surplus gains in their network decisions. A possible policy lesson is that airlines should be granted antitrust immunity conditional on extending the network geographically and/or by increasing frequency supply.====Collaboration can increase the incentives to maintain a more extensive and complete network also through another channel. Even though the two routes would be sufficiently differentiated to support equilibrium networks with two connections, the perfect complementarity of carrier networks leads to the existence of a coordination problem in the sense that maintaining only one connection always represents an equilibrium network solution. Carrier collaboration can, therefore, support the maintenance of two connections by overcoming the potential coordination problem that exists in the case of independent network choices.====Bilotkach (2019) surveys papers on airline partnerships and antitrust immunity and distinguishes between studies which concentrate on price effects and studies which also consider non-price product characteristics. This paper contributes to the second type by analyzing how carrier collaboration can change network choices and how this can increase welfare depending on the heterogeneity of alternative connections. The paper most closely related to the present study is the one by Czerny et al. (2016). They consider a sequential structure in which the carriers choose frequencies and aircraft sizes in the first stage and fares in the second stage. They find that independent carriers strategically reduce frequency supply in the first stage in order to lower the other carrier's equilibrium fare in the second stage. In this case, carrier collaboration can increase frequency supply by eliminating the strategic reduction of frequencies by independent carriers, which is consistent with the results presented in this study. That carrier collaboration in the form of alliances can increase flight frequency in practice has been confirmed by Alderighi and Gaggero (2014). The present study contributes to this strand of the literature by highlighting that, besides the frequency interpretation, there is a geographical interpretation of the problem and by analyzing in detail the role of the heterogeneity between connections and the limited potential for collaboration and antitrust immunity to reach the welfare-optimal network structure. The study further contributes by highlighting the existence of a coordination problem.====The present study abstracts away from the issue of coordinating a given number of flights. This problem has been considered in a complementary study by Bilotkach (2007), who analyzes how carrier collaboration can help coordinating a given number of complementary flights. Adler and Hanany (2016) consider price and frequency choices in parallel carrier networks and find that carrier collaboration without antitrust immunity could be best for passengers. Alderighi and Gaggero (2018) empirically find a positive relationship between alliance membership and flight cancellations. Brueckner and Flores-Fillol (2020) consider endogenous pricing and frequency choices and provide a detailed discussion of how frequency choices can translate into schedule delays when carrier networks are complementary.====Many studies have theoretically and empirically highlighted the effects of carrier collaboration in the form of alliances and codeshares on air fares (for example, Oum et al., 1996; Park, 1997; Park and Zhang, 2000; Brueckner and Whalen, 2000; Brueckner, 2001 and 2003; Bamberger et al., 2004; Brueckner and Pels, 2005; Ito and Lee, 2005 and 2007; Whalen, 2007; Armantier and Richard, 2008; Gayle, 2008; Wan et al., 2009; Brueckner and Proost, 2010; Brueckner et al., 2011; Bilotkach and Hüschelrath, 2011, 2012 and 2013; Zou et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2015). Bilotkach (2005) and Zhang and Zhang (2006) analyze the rivalry between airline alliances. That carrier collaboration can reduce welfare by increasing air fares for non-stop passengers in complementary networks has been highlighted by Czerny (2009). Gaggero and Bartolini (2012) empirically analyze the determinants of airline alliances and provide insights on the airline incentives to join or form an alliance. The effect of carrier collaboration on the temporal profile of air fares has been studied by Alderighi et al. (2015). See Zhang and Czerny (2012) for a discussion of earlier studies of airline alliances and Bilotkach (2019) for a more recent overview over the corresponding literature and provides avenues for future research on the topic.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. The demand functions depending on carrier network choices are derived in Section 3. Section 4 uses the demand functions to analyze best responses in terms of network choices and equilibrium network structures when carriers are independent and networks that maximize joint profits when carriers are allied. Section 4 further analyzes the effects of carrier collaboration on consumer surplus and welfare. Section 5 concludes and develops avenues for future research.","Carrier collaboration with endogenous networks: Or, the limits of what carrier collaboration can achieve under antitrust immunity",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000430,1 May 2021,2021,Research Article,198.0

Such innovation is often driven by external factors involving technology, open markets, information technology, and the internet (Douglas, 2010; Schneider et al., 2013; Martin-Domingo and Martín, 2016; Berti and Casprini, 2018). Several studies have provided an all-encompassing definition of innovation as a valuable tool to create value and sustain competitive advantages (Srinivas and Krishna, 2009; Halpern, 2010).

Data was collected using a questionnaire distributed to 614 domestic air passengers using the snowball sampling method. The measurement tool had 16 scale items constructed on the recommendations of previous studies. Passenger satisfaction, airline service quality, passenger perceived value, and airline image are identified as determinants for airline loyalty. The predictive analytical approach of Artificial ","The consumer is at the core, around which the organisation marketing activities revolve (Kotler and Keller, 2009). Consumer retention and loyalty are what the organisation aspire to achieve (Dick and Basu, 1994). Highly competitive and extensively proliferated market with numerous brands is the harsh reality that marketing managers are facing today (Kotler and Armstrong, 2004). One of such highly competitive market is Aviation (Young et al., 1994). The advancement of science and technology bestows powerful computing tools and devices that could prove to be the saviour for the managers to deal with such a situation.====The open sky policy increases business competition in the aviation industry. To survive in the race, delivery of quality service at every touchpoint that meet passenger expectation is essential (Park, 2007). Air passenger patronising airline leads to an increase in revenue passenger miles due to repeat usage of services (Park et al., 2004). In the aviation industry, there is a need to develop passenger attachment with the airlines, Aaker (1996) rightly said that it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to serve the existing one.====The customer choice of services is influenced by many factors such as demographic, economic or psychographic (Jacoby and Keyner, 1973). Despite these, the airlines need to establish and maintain a long-lasting mutual benefiting relationship through passenger satisfaction, moreover repeat passenger preference of service is often termed as airline loyalty (Singh, 2018).====Consumer loyalty is considered as the most desirable phenomenon for firms, because commitment results in repeat purchase behaviour and positive word of mouth, therefore, more significant market share and superior financial performance of the firm (Merkert and Pearson, 2015. p. 262). it is also the outcome of marketing activities of the firm (Taylor et al., 2004; Chaudhuri, 1999; Kumar, 1999; Mittal and Lassar, 1998; Reichfeld and Schefter, 2000; Strauss and Friege, 1999).====Marketing literature suggests that the defences against the competition are developing stronger customer-firm relationships by providing superior product/service quality (Zeithaml et al., 1996), attaining customer satisfaction (Kotler and Keller, 2009), enhancing value for money (Kirmani and Zeithml, 1993), and developing consumer-based brand equity (Aaker, 1996; Keller, 2003). Service quality and perceived value for money are advocated to be positively associated with customer satisfaction (Aaker, 1996). Furthermore, customer satisfaction is considered a crucial factor affecting retention rates (Kotler and Armstrong, 2004). The repetitive purchase behaviour of passenger due to the deeply held commitment with the airline despite situational influences causing switching behaviour is the need for airline survival (Jacoby and Kyner, 1973).====Building efficient prediction models for loyalty constitute a significant concern of the marketing manager. Precisely prediction is a challenging task due to the statistical complexities that arise due to the nonlinear behaviour of the consumer. Few approaches are extensively used for analysing and predicting nonlinear consumer behaviour, like Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. These models require less time to perform prediction and used for real-time optimisation purposes (Ahmad et al., 2017). Researchers are extensively using Artificial Neural Network models for predicting loyalty (Leong et al., 2015; Tsaur et al., 2002). Research evidence on the comparison of Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest shows that Artificial Neural Network model outperforms the Random Forest model. Artificial Neural Network model is fault-tolerant, and noise immune (Ahmad et al., 2017) also they are more robust. However, it is not ideal for testing the causal relationship, so the Structural Equation Model is supplemented with it to determine causality between the predictors as well as with the response variable.

In this study, we propose three research paths: (1) exploring how knowledge sharing influences EO; (2) exploring how knowledge sharing correlates with EO as a mediator of motivation, creativity, and human capital; and (3) exploring how cooperation, climate and competitive intensity as critical moderators affect motivation and creativity. We tested our hypotheses using data collected from 505 airline employees from airline organizations. The following findings were identified: (1) knowledge sharing is positively and directly correlated with EO; (2) knowledge sharing affects EO through motivation, creativity, and human capital but creativity does not indicate mediation effects between motivation and human capital; (3) both cooperative climate and competition intensity are positively affected by motivation and creativity; and (4) competition intensity positively affects knowledge sharing and motivation. To address the theoretical and managerial contribution of this study, a robustness examination was conducted to generalize the findings. Furthermore, this study further enriches the creativity and EO theory of uniqueness and identification. More importantly, this study provides effective and appropriate methods for airline ==== by guiding their employees to conduct entrepreneurial orientation in a cooperative circumstance successfully, and it especially emphasizes the role of knowledge sharing in facilitating motivation, creativity and human capital. Lastly, limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed.","With the rapid development of tourism and the hospitality industry, there is increased interest in research on entrepreneurial orientation (EO) development (Peters and Kallmuenzer, 2015). Recently, empirical researchers have found that the EO literature is commonly associated with EO firm performance (Engelen et al., 2014). More importantly, researchers have recognized EO as a powerful predictor of firm performance, which needs more discussion (Pittino et al., 2017; Kura, Abubakar, & Salleh 2020). In a turbulent environment, EO is considered an organizational resource that allows organizations to differentiate themselves from competitors (Ireland et al., 2003), and the organization may respond to challenges by promoting EO (Hernández-Linares et al., 2018).====Internationalization and globalization showed that airline industrial phenomena are not only pure competition but also accompanied by cooperative behavior among airline firms (Su et al., 2019). According to Klein et al. (2020), airline industries are more suitable for an analysis of cooperation-competition behavior because they face multimarket competition and need the intensity of cooperation to enter the new market. Furthermore, EO helps firms to be innovative and more active by maintaining cooperative relationships outside the organization rather than increasing the competitive force or acting aggressively against industry rivals (Franco and Haase, 2013). Additionally, EO helps airline firms to enlarge their learning capability and strengthens their competitive advantage position to sustain profitable growth (Chen et al., 2019). Regarding the relationships among EO, knowledge sharing and the concepts of sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), knowledge sharing enables entrepreneurs to be innovative regarding progressive world populations and reduces waste. The airline industry can affect future generations globally in terms of environmental and social impacts (Kim and Kim, 2018). In this instance, the airline industry places heavy emphasis on knowledge sharing to encourage EO and develop human resources to improve performance (Lee and Moon, 2018). Consequently, the crucial factors that determine better airline business performance is entrepreneurial marketing to promote proactiveness, risk-taking, and innovativeness (Allameh et al., 2020) and knowledge sharing to capture opportunities, leverage resources and support value creation (Gyanwali and Walsh, 2019). Specifically, previous tourism research has explored indicators to identify entrepreneurial characteristics of the airline industry. These include locus of control, creativity, ambiguity tolerance, risk-taking, need for achievement, diligence, challenge ability, and future vision (Sadeghi and Esteki, 2010). Furthermore, prior research has found that the tourism and hospitality students who obtain proper entrepreneurial education will promote the formation of their entrepreneurial intention, which will especially enhance their ability to face entrepreneurial challenges (Zhang et al., 2020). It is worth noting that employees with entrepreneurial characteristics embody the essential aspects of entrepreneurial development, as entrepreneurial characteristics are important when responding to market conditions and trends (Sahi et al., 2019). This phenomenon may be due in part to the focus on airline employees' EO development and their understanding of how the organization can most effectively utilize EO to maximize the overall level of a firm's performance.====Accordingly, EO is commonly associated with firm performance (Jeffrey et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Vaznyte and Petra, 2019; Covin et al., 2020). This is especially true for firms focused in small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sectors (Asemokha et al., 2019; Sentanu and Praharjo, 2019) as well as the family-firm sector (Hernández-Linares et al., 2019). Furthermore, recent scholars have expanded the EO literature, crossing over from entrepreneurship to the education and medical fields, such as the university sector (Migliori et al., 2019) and hospital sector (Chahal et al., 2019). Since EO has been discussed regarding performance in SMEs, family firms, and the medical and education fields, we therefore posit that EO is applicable within the airlines sector.====In this instance, the literature is still scarce in explaining how knowledge-sharing and the cooperation-competition mechanism affect EO development in tourism and the hospitality industry. To address this gap, this study delves into the intersection of airline employees’ knowledge sharing and EO. Against this background, this study answers the following questions: “How can the cooperation-competition mechanism influence the EO development of airline employees?” and “How can knowledge sharing affect EO within airline organizations?” Due to the lack of prior research regarding these questions, we propose the following three research paths: (1) exploring how knowledge sharing influences EO, (2) exploring how knowledge sharing correlates with EO through the mediators of motivation, creativity, and human capital, and (3) exploring how cooperation climate and competitive intensity are critical moderators affecting motivation and creativity.

In this paper we assess the price difference between virtual interlined and ‘traditional’ flight itineraries within the intra-European airport network. We query Kiwi.com's recently developed Tequila platform, one of the few specialised online travel agencies (OTAs) offering both ‘traditional’ and virtual interlined flight itineraries, to obtain information on all available flights in the first week of August, October and December 2019. Using a series of sign tests, we investigate whether a statistically significant fare difference exists between the cheapest available (direct and/or indirect) ‘traditional’ and virtual interlined flight itineraries. Our results indicate a statistically significant fare difference between the cheapest ==== ‘traditional’ and the virtual interlined flight itineraries in favour of the latter. However, with regard to ==== traditional flight itineraries the results are mixed. We explore the size and the scope of these patterns in more detail, and outline possible avenues for further research.","In the broadest sense, self-connecting refers to the combination of flights operated by non-partner, independent and/or low-cost carriers (LCCs)==== beyond the scope of airline alliances and interline or codeshare agreements (Cattaneo et al., 2019; Suau-Sanchez et al., 2017a; Voltes-Dorta and Martín, 2019). Self-connecting travellers thus combine and buy multiple separate flight tickets in order to reach their destination, which consequently involves rechecking their baggage at self-transfer airports. Because self-connected flight itineraries do not constitute an airline-managed trajectory, the airlines cannot be held accountable for missed connections. In spite of these drawbacks, there appears to be a consensus in both academic and commercial literature on the potential money-saving character of self-connecting air travel (see, for example, Ali et al., 2019; Grimme, 2008; PhocusWire, 2018; Suau-Sanchez et al., 2017a, 2016). Furthermore, the connectivity-enhancing potential of self-connecting is widely evidenced (see, for example, Malighetti et al., 2008). However, because travellers may experience difficulties in constructing these flight itineraries themselves (Malighetti et al., 2008; OAG, 2016), commonly referred to as the ‘awareness problem’ inherent to self-connecting air travel (Cattaneo et al., 2017; Grimme, 2008; Maertens et al., 2016), a considerable number of self-connecting flight options remains hidden and unexploited.====In recent years, however, new online platforms providing self-connecting flight tickets have sprung up, allowing travellers to self-connect more easily between multiple airports (Cattaneo et al., 2019; Maertens et al., 2016; Never and Suau-Sanchez, 2020). As such, the prospect of self-connectivity is rising (Never and Suau-Sanchez, 2020). These ‘non-hidden’ or actively marketed self-connecting flight itineraries are often referred to as ==== flight itineraries (see, for example, IATA, 2019; Panayotov, 2018; PhocusWire, 2018). In contrast to self-connecting, virtual interlining thus refers to an organised process (Panayotov, 2018), in which self-connecting flight itineraries are typically combined and sold by specialised online travel agencies (OTAs) via a single transaction (IATA, 2019). In addition, the OTA may provide a guarantee against missed connections, sometimes at an additional cost (IATA, 2019; Panayotov, 2018). Hence, travellers do not have to combine the different flights themselves, and may consequently not even be fully aware of the self-connecting character of the travel itinerary. Although typically provided by specialised OTAs, it still remains unclear whether and to what extent other forms of ==== self-connections (e.g. via airport-led transfer schemes or through specific airline-facilitated platforms such as ‘Worldwide by easyJet’, see for example Never and Suau-Sanchez, 2020) may equally be designated as virtual interlining. In this paper, we specifically focus on virtual interlined flight itineraries that are offered for sale by an OTA (====) via a single transaction. Following Suau-Sanchez et al. (2017b) and Voltes-Dorta and Martín (2019), we denote all flight itineraries that do ==== involve a connection between non-related carriers as ==== flight itineraries (i.e. flight itineraries involving only alliance-based connections, interline agreement-based connections, connections between codeshare partners or connections provided and protected by a single carrier, supplemented with direct and non-stop flight itineraries).====Virtual interlining is widely considered (see, for example, Panayotov, 2018) and advertised – both by the OTAs offering virtual interlined flight itineraries, as well as by multiple travel blogs and travel websites – as a money-saving travel strategy. In a recent IATA (2019) report, however, the money-saving character of virtual interlining has been called into question. To the best of our knowledge, no research has yet been conducted that systematically evaluates the potential of virtual interlining from a cost-based perspective. Against this backdrop, this study attempts to bridge this gap by investigating whether and to what extent these virtual interlined flight itineraries within the intra-European airport network differ from traditional flight itineraries in terms of airfares. By focusing on virtual interlined air travel we thus aim to capture self-connecting flight schedules that are ==== visible to the consumer during the booking process. As such, we simultaneously address (part of) the ‘awareness problem’ inherent to self-connecting air travel (Cattaneo et al, 2017, 2019; Grimme, 2008; Maertens et al., 2016).====Our contribution to the research field dealing with self-connectivity is twofold. First and foremost, we aim to provide insight in the potential price variation(s) between virtual interlined and traditional flight itineraries within the intra-European air transport network. Second, we contribute to the existing literature on self-connectivity by particularly focusing on ==== flight itineraries, thus addressing a specific category of the self-connectivity spectrum that has as yet received little attention in academic research.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we elaborate on the self-connecting research praxis by providing a literature overview on this topic. Following this, we briefly touch upon airline pricing strategies and its consequences for our research design, which involves a concise reflection on the volatile nature and dispersion of airfares and flight availability.

It further explores the role of job satisfaction as a mediator between internal branding and work outcomes. Following an analysis of 485 responses, we find that leadership, ideology, and communities positively influence job satisfaction, which in turn affects intention-to-stay, team performance, and brand commitment. Job satisfaction is also found to mediate the relationships between internal branding (i.e., transformational leadership, brand ideology, and internal brand communities) and work outcomes. These findings highlight that appropriate branding strategies can enhance airline development through employee satisfaction.","The emergence of budget airlines has created a fiercely competitive market. In this context, maintaining a strong brand image is increasingly important for airlines. Successful branding can increase customer confidence in a carrier (Lin and Ryan, 2016), increase product recognition, and help to overcome commoditization (O'Neill and Mattila, 2004). A common feature of successful brands is the unique brand experience that employees can offer customers (Boo et al., 2009; King and Grace, 2010). Internal brand management is considered an effective tool for building as well as maintaining strong brands; ultimately it is the employee who is responsible for delivering on the brand promise (King and Grace, 2012; Piehler, 2018). In the airline industry, which is labor-intensive and involves frequent customer interaction, brand success is even more closely tied to employee behavior (Erkmen and Hancer, 2015a; Hu et al., 2017). Airline staff must adopt brand-consistent behaviors that support the development of a coherent brand image and a shared set of brand values (Xiong et al., 2013). Therefore, airline staff is considered a key factor of corporate brand management.====While many airlines are dedicated to delivering an exceptional customer experience, employee turnover rates are often high, which indicates that internal branding is less emphasized. Practitioners and researchers have explored ways in which organizations can motivate employees to achieve the desired performance levels and promote company loyalty. As in any organization, it is crucial for airlines to retain high-performing staff. One means of achieving this is the maintenance of high job satisfaction among employees (Kalawilapathirage et al., 2019). In the airline industry, emotional components (such as satisfaction) lead to behavioral commitment (Zins, 2001). Internal branding not only influences brand performance but also influences attitudes that employees possess toward the brand, which in turn affects employee performance (Punjaisri and Wilson, 2007). Employee attitudes, behaviors, and commitment are frequently discussed in the context of internal branding (Burmann et al., 2009a, Burmann et al., 2009b; Punjaisri and Wilson, 2011; Thomson et al., 1999); however, these terms are mostly applied without theoretical foundations (Burmann and Zeplin, 2005). Therefore, there is a vital need to understand the effects of internal branding on job satisfaction and work outcomes.====Theories of internal branding are still in the early stages (Liu et al., 2017). A recent study suggested that future research should focus on broadening knowledge of internal branding in the service sector (Vatankhah and Darvishi, 2018). Moreover, little attention has been paid to the work outcomes of internal branding (Iyer et al., 2018), especially in the context of airlines. A review of recent studies shows that there is still a lack of empirical evidence on the positive influences of internal branding and its contributions to work outcomes (Buil et al., 2016; Eid et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017). Accordingly, this study has broadened the concept of internal branding into a comprehensive, five-part framework, which includes brand ideology and internal brand communities. We sought to fill an important research gap by examining the causal relationships among internal branding (cognitive dimension), job satisfaction (affective dimension), and work outcomes (behavioral dimension). The proposed theoretical framework explains and predicts efficient internal brand management. Our findings expand current knowledge of internal branding and are relevant to the fields of human resource management, branding, marketing, and business management.",The impact of airline internal branding on work outcomes using job satisfaction as a mediator,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000466,14 April 2021,2021,Research Article,203.0

This research extends the existing discussions by considering a network perspective to explore East Asian airports. A total of 4611 routes among 318 airports in the second half of 2017 are analyzed using panel data regressions. Results show that the attributes of airports and routes linked with the departure and arrival airports of a flight are the essential determinants of flight delays in East Asia. However, the congestion internalization and hubness effect of departure and arrival airports suggested in previous research are not observed in this region. The associations of slot control levels and route attributes with delays are varying between airports inside and outside China and domestic and international routes. This research supplements a new perspective to understand the determinants of flight delays in existing literature and provides a rarely observed knowledge to encourage East Asian airport operators and carriers developing management strategies for minimizing flight delays.","Consistent flight punctuality is an essential issue among passengers, airport operators, and carriers. Flight delays may result in passengers' losses and decrease in revenues of airport operators and carriers given the reluctance of passengers to travel to, from, or transfer at a particular airport (Britto et al., 2012). Clarifications of determinants of flight delays help airport operators and carriers develop management strategies, especially for airports in East Asia. In the past few decades, the size and scope of commercial air transport in Asia and the Pacific region have rapidly increased (Duval, 2014). Specifically, the number of passengers carried by flights in this region has reached 816 million in 2011 and increased to 1604 million in 2018, thereby making it a leader in terms of air traffic, followed by Europe and North America (ICAO, 2011; 2018). However, the on-time performance of East Asian airports can be considered the worst in the world. According to the data of FlightStats (2015), 18 of the world's 20 most delayed airports in 2015 are located in East Asia, and their on-time rates are only ranging from 32.15% to 53.22%.====Previous studies did not provide comprehensive knowledge on the determinants of flight delays in terms of perspective and geography. Regarding comprehensive perspectives, previous studies explored the hypotheses of ==== and ==== from an airport perspective and ==== from a route perspective (Bendinelli et al., 2016; Brueckner, 2002; Greenfield, 2014; Mayer and Sinai, 2003; Mazzeo, 2003; Rupp, 2009; Santos and Robin, 2010). However, a network perspective has not been explored together with airport and route perspectives. A delay can spread from one part of a network to another. A flight delay during one flying segment affects subsequent flying tasks. Such delay propagation effects among airports in a flight network have been explored in previous studies (Du et al., 2018; Hao, 2014; Wu and Law, 2019; Yue and Wei, 2014; Zanin et al., 2017; Zhang, 2016). Existing findings suggest that a flight delay is related to ====–==== (i.e., ====). However, linking airports and routes from a network perspective have not been well studied combined with the attributes of d–a airports and route of a flight in previous studies on determinants of flight delays. In terms of geographical gap, previous studies on the determinants of flight delays are based on domestic flights in the US (Ater and Orlov, 2015; Brueckner, 2002; Greenfield, 2014; Mayer and Sinai, 2003; Mazzeo, 2003; Prince and Simon, 2009, 2014; Rupp, 2009). Only few studies are based on intra-European flights (Santos and Robin, 2010) and domestic flights in Brazil (Bendinelli et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, the research on the flight delays in East Asia is lacking. The states in this region are diverse in terms of social, economic, and political contexts. Such diversity is varying among previous studies that investigated flights within a country or a political and economic union.====To fill the aforementioned research gaps, this research aims to address the following issues: 1) whether the determinants of flight delays and the findings of previous studies are applicable to East Asia, and 2) the role of a network perspective in the determinants of flight delays. Thus, this research proposes a three-perspective framework to specify the explanatory variables associated with flight delays. A total of 584,968 flight observations are collected from 4611 routes among 318 airports in East Asia from July to December 2017. Panel data regressions are adopted to verify the influence of the three-perspective attributes on the flight delays at East Asian airports. The study results provide a new perspective into understanding the determinants of flight delays in existing literature and a rarely observed knowledge that can advise operators and carriers in East Asian airports to develop management strategies for minimizing flight delays.====The remaining parts of this article are organized as follows.

After Covid-19, safety and hygiene will be the top priority. As a result, changes in airport operating procedures are inevitable. The most noticeable difference will be the strengthening of the verification process for passengers' health conditions. Dwell time increase can be the by-products. This study identifies a dwell time increase has a more significant impact on increasing the existing purchasers' spending than creating new buyers. Airport operators can introduce a service differentiation perspective, such as a dedicated service, to utilize the current buyers' dwell time more faithfully. Also, the rise of online channels requires airport operators to change sales strategies, reinforcing emotional promotion to stimulate impulse buyers' willingness-to-buy. Before Covid-19, there was little effort to reconcile operation policies and commercial revenue despite the growing importance of revenue management. However, now it is time to change. Pre-Covid-19, passengers were advised of using off-airport processes, such as online check-in and mobile boarding passes. Now, getting passengers to the airport quickly and securing their dwell time can be financially more beneficial. It is necessary to incorporate the commercial revenue perspective into operation policies post-Covid-19 actively. Our finding indicates that even a passenger with solid purchasing power may lose the purchasing intention when assigned to an unfavorable gate or terminal. Airport operators need a better understanding of passenger and flight characteristics when determining operation policy, such as gate allocation or membership services.","). The damage is expected to top $84 billion in 2020, according to International Air Transport Association (====As low-cost carriers (LCCs) have expanded their market share since the early 2000s, the airline industry has become more sensitive to costs. As competition to attract airlines has intensified (====), financial stability is increasingly essential to maintain competitive airport fees (====). However, Covid-19 arouses severe concerns about the financial stability of the aviation industry. Passenger demand has declined sharply, and many airlines are at risk of bankruptcy. Due to Covid-19, each airport lost 50% of connections on average, and network efficiency decreased more (====). It is still unknown when the Covid-19 pandemic will be over. Government regulations, such as a lockdown or monetary penalty, may continue because individuals do not internalize the external cost of infection risks they impose on others and the health care system (====). Airport operators are required to equip additional procedures, including strengthening quarantine. Passengers may be recommended to arrive at the airport earlier. However, it is questionable whether a change in airport arrival time leads to a commercial revenue increase. It is also interesting how the change affects passengers’ behavior, especially at commercial facilities. According to an annual survey from 919 airports in the 2017 fiscal year by Airport Council International (ACI airport economics report, 2019), non-aeronautical revenue accounted for 40% of surveyed airports' total revenue. Airports in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, where non-aeronautical activities became a familiar concept for airport operation, reached almost 50% (Asia-Pacific: 47%, Middle East; 49%). Commercial revenue, the largest source of non-aeronautical income, accounts for an average of 14.5% of the world's airport revenue, which is larger than the landing charge's contribution, as shown in ==== (====). Therefore, discussing how to increase commercial revenue from airport operation procedure changes can provide significant implications for post-Covid-19 airport strategies.====). Therefore, looking into the duty-free transaction data is meaningful to understand passenger behaviors at commercial facilities. Also, the implications can be applied to other retail facilities.

This is achieved through the cointegration analysis and Granger-causality test, using monthly data collected from Hong Kong's top 17 tourist source markets during 2008–2018. Our analysis finds clear evidence of an overall two-way causal relationship between airline scheduled capacity and tourist arrivals. The positive externalities between the two crucial sectors to the Hong Kong economy call for coordinated planning and policy design in the tourism and aviation sectors, and justify continued government support.

Many studies found supporting evidence that air transport and tourism are mutually dependent (Duval, 2013, 2020; Ivanova, 2017; Spasojevic et al., 2018). Tourism growth stimulates aviation operations, whereas transport services, notably aviation services, are clearly essential elements in the delivery of tourism (Lumsdon and Page, 2007). Hong Kong has many roles at the same time: an “international aviation hub”, a “regional and international gateway”, “the planet's most popular city destination”, a “tourism destination”, and a “shopping paradise” (Lew and McKercher, 2002; McKercher, 2008; Homsombat et al., 2011; Tsui et al., 2018). Tourism is one of the pillar industries of Hong Kong==== (Jin, 2011; Airport Authority Hong Kong, 2020; Tourism Commission, 2019). The city has broad tourist appeal, attracting more than 58.47 million and 65.15 million of overseas tourists in 2017 and 2018, respectively (Hong Kong Tourism Board, 2017, 2018).==== In 2017, Hong Kong's tourism sector employed around 257,100 persons, accounting for about 7% of the city's total employment (Tourism Commission, 2019). Total expenditure associated with inbound tourism (TEAIT) in 2017 and 2018 were approximately HK$296.70 million and HK$328.19 million, respectively (Hong Kong Tourism, 2017, 2018). The main arrival mode of Hong Kong's tourists is by land transport, which is the dominant transport mode for tourists from mainland China. However, regional and inter-continental travellers mostly arrive by air (Fung et al., 2006; International Air Transport Association, 2014). Visitor arrivals by air to Hong Kong in 2017 and 2018 were approximately 23.4% and 22.08% of its total visitor arrivals (Hong Kong Tourism Board, 2017, 2018).====Despite the great success in the past decades, Hong Kong is facing many challenges in the years to come, notably high infrastructure and input costs in both the aviation and tourism sectors, limited potential of further capacity expansion in the long term, competition from the established network airlines and aggressive low-cost carriers (LCCs) in increasingly liberalized international market (Fu et al., 2010, 2015; Wang et al., 2017, 2020). It is important for stakeholders to have a good understanding of the key demand drivers for aviation and tourism, and how these two sectors influence each other. Hong Kong's aviation and tourism have to be aligned on the basis of sustainable development, thus that their interdependence are exploited for the benefits of the city's economy. This calls for well-defined empirical investigation to identify and quantify such interactions.====As discussed in more details in the literature review section, many studies have examined the relationship between aviation and tourism, which offer rich insight and practical findings across many markets. However, some research gaps remain. Importantly, Pacheco and Fernandes (2017) concluded that prior studies showed that there is no uniform relationship between air transport and tourism, or air transport and economic development. The causal relationships behave differently across countries and regions, and empirical estimation results can vary depending on the indicators and variable used. Therefore, the interactive relationship between aviation and tourism in Hong Kong shall not be taken for granted. Indeed, one would expect significant heterogeneity across the aviation markets linking Hong Kong to the rest of the world. Therefore, it is important to conduct empirical investigation using real market data. This study aims to complements previous studies by examining whether there is a significant long-term and causal relationship between airline seat capacity and inbound visitor arrivals in Hong Kong. By using data collected from Hong Kong's top 17 tourist source markets during the period of 2008–2018, robust inference can be made with a representative extensive dataset. More importantly, in the literature there has been a trade-off in sample size ====. market heterogeneity. To increase sample size, it is customary to pool the data from many markets to increase estimation efficiency. On the other hand, this could introduce significant heterogeneity in the sample. Our study restricts to the key tourist source markets to one single city (i.e. Hong Kong), so that destination market characteristics remained the same for all observations. On the other hand, a dataset over extended period means there are sufficient variation in the data which improves estimation accuracy. Our study is also among the first to use airline scheduled capacity in causality analysis. Previous studies have used indicators such as dummy variables of direct service availability (Duval and Schiff, 2011), flight frequency (Koo et al., 2017), actual passenger volume (Álvarez-Díaz et al., 2019), manager's score of airport performance (Castillo-Manzano et al., 2011). Because airlines schedules are mostly planned and released for booking in advance, they are more directly determined by airlines, and less dynamic compared to actual traffic volume that is jointly determined by supply and demand. Therefore, our approach enhances the robustness of estimation with very recent data, allowing us to provide reliable and timely findings to stakeholders in Hong Kong. Our analysis finds clear evidence of an overall two-way causal relationship between airline scheduled capacity and tourist arrivals. The positive externalities between the two crucial sectors to the Hong Kong economy call for coordinated planning and policy design in the tourism and aviation sectors, and justify continued government support. On the other hand, market-specific features are evident in selected markets. Such heterogeneity is likely due to airline network effect and regulation in the international market. Therefore, direct subsidy is not always an efficient support measure. A combination of liberalization policy and industry supports are preferred in views of the benefits to be achieved for the two sectors and the Hong Kong economy. Because lesiure tourists tend to be more price sensitive than business travellers, promoting the growth of the LCC sector may facilitate the growth and recovery of the tourism sector in Hong Kong, which has been badly hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic.====This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the key findings and research methods in the relevant literature. Section 3 provides an overview of scheduled airline seat capacity and visitor arrivals to Hong Kong from the sampled markets. Section 4 describes the methodology and reports estimation results. Section 5 discusses key findings and policy implications of this study. The last section summarises and explores possible future research opportunities.",Hong Kong's aviation and tourism growth - An empirical investigation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000193,1 April 2021,2021,Research Article,206.0

A case study in an aircraft maintenance unit showed that the “Financial” criterion and the sub-criterion of “Competitiveness and Improving Customer Satisfaction” (with weights of 0.3108 and 0.84, respectively) were the most critical ones. Due to the internal relations between the criteria and sub-criteria in the fuzzy MCDM and the opinions of the experts of the aircraft maintenance unit, the weights of the main criteria obtained were closer to the actual conditions.","Any service industry's success depends on the quality of the services offered. Service is a social activity that occurs between a customer and a service representative (Gupta, 2018). The aviation industry is one of the essential industries, where the provided services depict the industry's survivability. One of the crucial sectors of this industry is the maintenance department.====Aircraft maintenance is one of the vital aviation activities which is carried out periodically to ensure safety and reliability. This activity spends 9% of the total annual operating cost of aircraft (Qin et al., 2018). Aircraft maintenance is one of the main causes of the reduction in aviation accidents (Dalkilic, 2017). Aircraft maintenance processes play a vital role in aircraft safety operations (Stadnicka et al., 2017). Indeed, aviation has a close relationship with the safety culture, not because of the high incidence of accidents but because of any mistake's severe consequences. At high speed and altitude, minor human and technical errors can quickly lead to devastating accidents. Generally, aircraft maintenance is essential for its safety (Atak and Kingma, 2011). Aircraft maintenance service organizations are committed to confirming the aircraft's accuracy after completing the relevant processes, which leads to an increase in the aviation industry's survival and the number of planes. Therefore, to have fair competition, the maintenance department has to reduce the waiting time for its services. Moreover, this goal requires special skills due to the complexity of maintenance operations and cannot be easily achieved (Stadnicka et al., 2017).====Bevilacqua and Braglia (2000) employed the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to select Italy's oil refinery's most suitable maintenance strategy. Indeed, they considered five critical alternatives, which included corrective, opportunistic maintenance, predictive, condition-based, and preventive. In order to evaluate the results of the AHP method, they conducted a sensitivity analysis as well, and the results demonstrated that the AHP method has an acceptable performance. Ahmadi et al. (2009) tried to propose a simple framework to select a proper maintenance strategy based on a cost-benefit approach. To find the best strategy, the AHP method was used, while some criteria (Air Interruption and Ground Interruption) were benefit-type, and some were cost-type (Operational Interruption and Maintenance Interruption). In another research, Ahmadi et al. (2010) presented a hybrid of Benefit- systems. Zare et al. (2018) also used Group TOPSIS and VIKOR to choose a suitable Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Saharkhiz et al. (2012) compared two CMMS software performances using statistical analysis in a refinery. Stadnicka et al. (2017) proposed a structure for the maintenance selection problem using the AHP method. They utilized four critical attributes, including safety, environment, economics, and health, for selecting maintenance strategy. Tan et al. (2011) tried to find the best maintenance strategy using the AHP method under a risk-based methodology. Additionally, they have examined the proposed method's performance in the ISOMAX unit, a part of the Fujian oil refinery. Fathi et al. (2011) utilized the Fuzzy TOPSIS method to evaluate a manufacturing company's maintenance policy. They used the Fuzzy approach to cover uncertainty while linguistic variables were employed as input data. After converting linguistic variables to Fuzzy numbers, Fuzzy TOPSIS was utilized to select the best policy. Based on their research, a preventive maintenance strategy was the best choice for the investigated company. Chan and Prakash (2012) employed a distance-based Fuzzy MCDM approach to select a suitable maintenance strategy. They believed that choosing a proper maintenance strategy could promote manufacturing companies' efficiency. Sadeghi and Manesh (2012) declared that choosing an appropriate maintenance strategy can decrease production costs. They have employed the fuzzy approach and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method for prioritizing maintenance strategies such as Traditional Maintenance, World-Class Maintenance Systems, and Total Productive Maintenance.====Furthermore, they have implemented the proposed approach in a manufacturing company. Jayaswal et al. (2013) presented a methodology for selecting a suitable maintenance strategy when criteria are qualitative and quantitative at the same time. They used the fuzzy TOPSIS method, and the proposed approach has been implemented in India for material handling equipment. In another research, Kumar et al. (2013) used the Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting approach to select a maintenance strategy for India's material handling machines. They considered six maintenance strategies and ten criteria for the problem. As a result, the breakdown maintenance strategy was chosen as the best strategy. Nezami and Yildirim (2013) claimed that using the sustainability approach could reflect total costs, energy, and material in companies. Therefore, they proposed a framework for selecting a maintenance strategy based on sustainable decision-making and the fuzzy VIKOR method. Odeyale et al. (2013) applied the AHP method in manufacturing industries to choose suitable maintenance strategies. They considered predictive, corrective, and preventive maintenance as alternatives for decision-making problems. Tadić et al. (2014) used a combination of fuzzy MADM such as fuzzy ANP, fuzzy VIKOR, and fuzzy DEMATEL for selecting city logistic concepts. Uygun et al. (2014) evaluated an outsourcing provider for a telecommunication company using the Fuzzy ANP and DEMATEL. Pandey (2016) assessed the service quality of Thailand's airport using fuzzy MADM. Bongo and Ocampo (2017) combined the techniques of TOPSIS, DEMATEL, and ANP methods in a fuzzy context to propose a model for decreasing the excess crowd in the airport. Barak and Dahooei (2018) evaluated seven airports and selected the safest of them using the combination of fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA) and MADM. Chen and Ren (2018) assessed the sustainability of various types of fuels regarding aviation by employing grey relation analysis (GRA) and ANP in an uncertain context. Perçin (2018) ranked and evaluated Turkish aviation services' quality performance using fuzzy ANP, VIKOR, and DEMATEL. Kilic and Ucler (2019) investigated stress among beginner pilots using the AHP method due to the probability of a chain of events in the cockpit due to human error.====Considering the importance of aircraft maintenance, in this paper, we tried to use strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT), balanced scorecard (BSC), quality function deployment (QFD), and Fuzzy MCDM to prioritize the strategies of this unit. SWOT analysis enables organizations to apply a realistic approach to define goals and missions (Polat et al., 2017). BSC is an approach for performance evaluation, which was presented by Kaplan and Norton (1992). This approach provided a comprehensive and multidimensional view of the organization's performance through four factors such as financial, customer, learning and growth and internal processes (Modak et al., 2017). The QFD is a structure that transforms the customer's needs into the appropriate technology required to improve the production of a product. The QFD was presented by Japanese scholars Yoji Akao and Shigeru Mizuno in 1960 (Hsu et al., 2017).====Lee and Lo (2003) argued that since the first step in realizing BSC is to clarify the company's vision and strategy, a set of strategies can be created by using the SWOT analysis. BSC is widely used in company performance management, which can easily expand the organisation's strategic planning. Although BSC does not show how customers and markets can be identified, it plays a significant role in strengthening customer initiatives and organization strategy. A combination of QFD and BSC presents a strategic management tool that can measure performance across and within each BSC perspective. The fundamental weakness of BSC is the absence of ""Hows"" in it, which, by connecting BSC to QFD, all ""Hows"" can be identified. Using the BSC features, 'Whats' are expressed in the vertical axis and 'Hows' in the horizontal axis of the QFD model. In the QFD method, the 'Hows' and 'Whats' are translated into four perspectives of BSC. The combination of QFD and BSC helps organizations better understand how they can achieve their goals (Tavana et al., 2013). BSC perspectives play the role of benchmarks in MCDM techniques and are also measured quantitatively and qualitatively (Varmazyar et al., 2016). The use of ANP as one of the MCDM methods can provide a framework for decision-making (Tavana et al., 2013).====Several researchers have used different methods of combining SWOT, BSC, and QFD. Among these researches, we can mention the following: The combination of BSC and QFD (Koo (1998), Tan et al. (2004), Dror (2008)), the combination of SWOT, BSC, and QFD (Lee and Sai on ko, (2000), (Lee et al. (2000), and Koo (2004)), the combination of BSC, QFD and MCDM ((Li et al., 2011)). Also, the combination of BSC, QFD, and Fuzzy MCDM was investigated by Tavana et al. (2013) and Hsu et al. (2017). Several kinds of research in prioritizing strategies are mentioned as follows: Shahabi et al. (2014) used the ANP-SWOT method to analyze the dependence and prioritization of steel waste industry strategies. Jovanović et al. (2015) aimed to improve energy management by prioritizing manufacturing industries using the AHP method. Arsić et al. (2017) used the hybrid model of SWOT-ANP-FANP to prioritize sustainable ecotourism development strategies. Arsić et al. (2018) also used the ANP-SWOT framework to prioritize ecosystem management in a national park.====This paper focuses on prioritizing strategies using an integrated approach of SWOT-BSC-QFD, FANP, and FPP methods for the first time. This research has been carried out in an aircraft maintenance unit. The combined approach of SWOT-BSC-QFD made it possible to calculate and compare the results in three methods: 1- SWOT-BSC approach and FAHP approach, 2- SWOT-BSC approach and FANP method; 3- SWOT-BSC-QFD approach and FANP method. Also, the research steps are as follows: The first step determines the strategies for the SWOT matrix. The second step involves specifying BSC perspectives using SWOT. Here, using the FPP method and applying the FAHP and FANP approaches, weights of criteria and sub-criteria are calculated. The third step also includes combining SWOT-BSC with the QFD method. After determining the weights of criteria and sub-criteria by the FANP method, the obtained weights are compared and ranked in the methods mentioned above.====The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology used in this paper. Section 3 explains the method used in the research. Section 4 explains the research method in the case study.

Airport traffic recovery replaces airport congestion to become the primary challenge of major airports around the world. With the pandemic well controlled domestically in China, the government liberalizes the hub airport slots for those previously forbidden services to the small/regional airports. This paper thus analytically examines the effect of this slot liberalization. The government subsidy to the small airports has also been considered. It is found that the slot liberalization can speed up airport traffic recovery for both hub and small airports. The hub airport slot liberalization leads to a lower level of minimum subsidy to sustain the survival of the small airports. Given any fixed level of subsidy to the small airport, both the total airport traffic and social welfare would improve with the slot liberalization at the hub airport. When the government can adjust the level of subsidy after liberalizing the hub airport slots, the subsidy could be excessive, if the government emphasizes too much on airport traffic recovery. This would, however, harm the overall social welfare.","Among all Chinese airports, those hub airports have been more adversely affected, with serious traffic drop in both magnitude and percentage. ==== in ==== summarizes the passenger traffic change for major Chinese airports (with annual passenger throughput exceeding 10 million as of 2019).==== Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou airports have been hub airports for China's Big Three Airlines (i.e., Air China, China Eastern, and China Southern, respectively). These airports are also China's gateways for international air travel, thus being hit the worst. The secondary and sizable Chinese airports were overall less impacted probably due to their smaller proportion of international traffic. For those small or regional Chinese airports having less than 2-million annual passenger traffic (hereafter referred to as “small airports”), their throughputs were also significantly reduced due to the pandemic (as shown in ==== in ====). Small airports could face even more difficult financial conditions under dramatic traffic decline. Unlike the larger airports, these airports do not have enough capital reserve as they mainly live on government subsidies (====). With limited market size, they are less resilient to dramatic demand shock, probably taking a long time to fully recover.====In addition to direct monetary subsidy, CAAC considers granting small airports more access to the hub airports. As observed in ==== and ====, most Chinese air traffics are concentrated at hub airports in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Unlike those liberalized airline markets (e.g., the US and Europe), the airport slots in large Chinese airports, especially the hub airports in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, have been tightly controlled by CAAC (====). Chinese airline market was already largely liberalized in many aspects in the past three decades, such as airfare setting, fleet planning, airline ownership, etc. (====, ====; ====). Since 2013, CAAC has also greatly lessened the airline route entry restrictions, allowing airlines to freely enter and exit any routes without a formal permit from CAAC. However, the airport slots in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are still tightly controlled by CAAC, and any route entry involved in these airports is subject to CAAC's approval. In particular, CAAC formally restricts any airline operation between small airports (less than 2-million annual passenger throughput) and hub airports in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,==== thus this market is commonly served by high-speed rail (HSR) (====; ====; ====; ====).====Such slot allocation restrictions are justified with two major rationales. First, major Chinese airports suffered very serious congestion, requiring strict slot allocation control. As reported in ==== and ====, in 2017, the average flight arrival delay at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport is 42.4 min; 46.1 min at Shanghai Pudong Airport; 47.9 min at Shanghai Hongqiao Airport; and 48 min at Beijing Capital Airport. This had become such a pressing issue that CAAC introduced a heavy-handed regulation on October 29, 2017. This policy introduced strict rules on capacity increases for slot-coordinated airports, and in some cases reduced the allowable capacities for airports that had an on-time performance (OTP) below 85% in the previous season. Airlines are also forced to cancel their flights that had repeatedly poor OTP. Second, the airline markets involved in the hub airports are the most lucrative in China, The time slots at these hub airports are scarce resources, mainly acquired by dominant airlines through ""grandfather rules"" (====, ====). The Big Three Airlines are largely state-owned and are based at these hub airports. CAAC is thus intended to restrict new market entries at these hub airports, especially preventing those private or low-cost carriers (LCCs), in order to avoid fierce competition with these legacy carriers (====).====However, as discussed earlier, Chinese major hub airports have seen a more dramatic traffic drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with the international traffic difficult to rebound in the short run. Their airport congestion has been greatly alleviated, and more slot resources have been released for possible re-allocations.==== When most of the existing domestic routes at the hub airports have yet achieved the traffic level before the pandemic, it would be feasible to assign the newly available slots to serve those small airports that have originally been banned. Moreover, the services to these small airports are mainly offered by the private airlines or local carriers, such that they will not impose head-to-head competition with the Big Three Airlines. That is, the Big Three Airlines’ recovery would not be largely harmed by opening up the hub airports to serve small airports.====On September 16, 2020, CAAC formally announced to remove the capacity constraint of the hub airports in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, and also eliminate restrictions for these hub airports to fly to small airports.==== This policy marks a significant step in the liberalization of China's airline market. For the first time, Chinese airlines are granted the freedom to acquire slots and freely decide route entries involved in the hub airports in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. CAAC's new policy can be summarized in the following two main points:====This new CAAC policy targets to speed up China's airline market recovery, in particular for a large number of small airports. It is also one remarkable step in China's airline market liberalization. This study thus aims to build an economic model with a simplified airline network, analytically examining the effect of such policy on the airline market outcomes, including airline route entry decisions, airport throughputs (both hub and small airports), airfares, and the social welfare. The results could provide a comprehensive evaluation of the policy's effects and mechanisms to speed up air traffic recovery in China. Specifically, liberalizing slots at the hub airport can increase airline traffic at both the hub and small airports, thus speeding up airport traffic recovery, ====. The airline operating based at the small airport can have higher profit by entering the routes between the small and hub airports, while the profit of the legacy carriers based at the hub airport would not necessarily be negatively affected. As a result, the minimum level of CAAC subsidy is lower to sustain the survival of the small airports after the slot liberalization at the hub airports. Given any fixed level of subsidy to the small airport, both the total airport traffic and social welfare would improve after slot liberalization at the hub airport. In addition, when CAAC can adjust its subsidy to small airports together with the decision on hub airport slot liberalization, the optimal subsidy level depends on the relative weight that CAAC puts on the airport traffic recovery and social welfare maximization. CAAC would provide a higher subsidy to small airports after liberalizing hub airport slots, because of the higher marginal gain in total airport traffic. However, when CAAC emphasizes too much on airport traffic recovery, the subsidy could be too much excessive, harming the overall social welfare due to its shadow price of the public fund spending.====This paper has multi-fold contributions. First, it provides an analytical evaluation of China's hub airport slot allocation liberalization on the network-wise market outcomes. Second, we predict the outcomes of such a new policy on the airport traffic for both the small and the hub airports, thus evaluating its effects to speed up airline market recovery. Last, our discussions based on the Chinese contexts also offer useful policy implications for other markets that also have a sizable domestic market (e.g., the US and European Union). Although other major airline markets are overall more liberalized, many of their gateway/hub airports have also been subject to tight slot control (i.e., the slot-coordinated airports). For example, four US airports have slots strictly controlled by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), including John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) (====This paper is organized as follows. Section ==== introduces our basic economic model setup, which is based on a simplified airline network consisted of both hub and small airports. The analytical results and relevant policy implications are provided in Section ====. Section ==== discusses the change in optimal subsidies when CAAC can adjust the subsidy level and how it affects the overall social welfare.

An optimization-based decision-support tool is introduced in this paper to assist slot coordinators in the initial slot allocation – the most important stage of that process. The WSG comprises both primary and additional criteria to be taken into account by slot coordinators at this stage. Considering all additional criteria specified in the WSG, this tool generates, in an acceptable amount of time, alternative efficient slot allocations against which the coordinators can evaluate the solutions obtained through the heuristic methods they apply. The decision-support tool also offers solution analysis features, such as visualization, ranking, comparison of multiple optimal solutions, and comparison of solutions regarding important characteristics not reflected in the WSG additional criteria. The tool is being tested at one of the largest airports worldwide – Guarulhos (Sao Paulo, Brazil) – with results that clearly illustrate its usefulness in practice.","In the vast majority of airports in which demand significantly exceeds capacity, the allocation of slots – that is, the allocation of “permissions to use the full range of airport infrastructure necessary to arrive or depart at an airport on a specific date and time” – is performed according to IATA's Worldwide Slot Guidelines (WSG) (IATA, 2017).==== The number of such airports, designated in the WSG as coordinated or Level 3, is relatively small (204 in the Summer season of 2019, i.e., around 6% of the airports offering scheduled services), but the number of passengers they handle is very large (1.5 billion departing passengers, i.e., 43% of the world's total; see IATA, 2019). Virtually all the busiest airports in the world are Level 3, with the exception of those in the United States, where the WSG are only being applied at New York's JFK International Airport. Thus, optimizing airport slot allocation is a function of critical importance to global air transport and, more generally, to the global economy.====The slot allocation process prescribed in the WSG is conducted bi-annually (for the Winter and Summer seasons) by coordinators appointed by the transport authorities of the respective countries, and involves several stages (see IATA, 2017; and Ribeiro et al., 2019b). The focus of this paper is on the most important stage of this process, the initial slot allocation, which takes place about five months before the beginning of each season. At this stage, the coordinators, after receiving airline requests for slots and considering the capacities declared by each airport, decide, for each request, whether it can be accepted, or needs to be displaced (and by how much) or rejected. “Displacing” a request means that the slot time assigned to the request is different from the time requested by the airline. At this stage, only series of slots – i.e., slots for the same flight on the same day of the week requested for at least five times over a season – are considered. It is important to distinguish between slot requests and series of slots. A slot request is a group of slots requested for different days of the week at the same time. Within a slot request, a series of slots corresponds to the slots requested for the same day of the week.====The coordinators are expected to perform the initial allocation of (series of) slots by applying, in a “neutral, transparent and non-discriminatory manner”, the primary and additional criteria specified in the WSG (IATA, 2017, Sections 8.3 and 8.4). The primary criteria distinguish requests for four classes of slots to be allocated in this order: historic (“grandfathered”) slots, i.e., slots already held by an airline in the previous equivalent season (Winter or Summer) that were operated at least 80% of the time (“use-it-or-lose-it” rule); change-to-historic, i.e., historic slots for which an airline requests a change (e.g., in the flight time or aircraft type); new-entrant slots, i.e., slots requested by an airline for a day where it holds fewer than five slots; and other slots.==== For each class, requests concerning year-round flights enjoy priority over other requests (IATA, 2017, Section 8.3.6). The primary criteria are straightforward to apply, but this is not the case with the additional criteria, which are used to break ties when requests in the same primary criteria class compete for the same slots. The WSG lists the following additional criteria: “effective period of operation”, “type of service and market”, “competition”, “curfews”, “requirements of the travelling public and other users”, “frequency of operation”, and “local guidelines” (IATA, 2017, Section 8.4). Detailed explanations of the additional criteria are provided in the next section.====The initial slot allocation is typically carried out by the coordinators using heuristic approaches with the support of software packages like PDC SCORE or T-Systems ====. These packages are certainly helpful, but do not offer optimization capabilities, and therefore may lead to slot allocation solutions that are not the most efficient possible (a solution is said to be efficient if it cannot be improved with respect to any objective without becoming worse with respect to, at least, another objective). Several models have been proposed in the literature recently that offer such capabilities (see, e.g., Zografos et al., 2012; Ribeiro et al., 2018; Zografos and Jiang, 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2019a; and Fairbrother et al., 2020). In particular, the optimization model presented in Ribeiro et al. (2018, 2019a) under the designation of Priority-based Slot Allocation Model (PSAM) has been shown through computational applications at several airports to provide slot allocations that are clearly better with respect to two key objectives than the ones coordinators have adopted (see Section 3.2.1). These objectives are the minimization of total displacement (i.e., the sum of the differences between the requested time and the allocated time for all the slots requested) and the minimization of maximum displacement (i.e., the maximum of such differences). However, these two objectives correspond to only a small subset of the additional criteria specified in the WSG.====The decision-support tool (or system) we describe in this paper is aimed to assist coordinators in the initial slot allocation stage. It is based on an extended version of PSAM that, in addition to the primary criteria, can cope with all the additional criteria that coordinators need or wish to consider, being therefore an optimization-based tool. Since the problem dealt with by coordinators is of a multi-objective nature, the tool includes solution generation, evaluation, visualization, ranking and comparison features to help them identify and analyze efficient solutions, as well as assess the solutions they develop through their heuristic approaches against those efficient solutions. In particular, the tool can support the exploration of multiple optimum slot allocation solutions (i.e., different solutions with the same optimum solution value). For the development of the tool, we have relied strongly on the collaboration of several coordinators, namely ANA (Portugal), ANAC (Brazil), BSC (Belgium), CNA (Norway), and, especially, COHOR (France). These collaborations were essential to help us better understand how coordinators use the additional criteria specified in the WSG in daily practice, and, subsequently, translate them into quantifiable objectives.====The application of the proposed tool is illustrated in this paper for the busiest airport in South America – Guarulhos (GRU), Sao Paulo, Brazil. In 2018, this airport was one of the world's top-50 airports with respect to passenger and flight movements. The application examples we provide refer specifically to requests for change-to-historic slots submitted to ANAC for the Winter season of 2018/2019. In total, 80,162 such slots were requested, or approximately 50% of the total number of requests. Despite this very large number of requested slot changes (to the best of our knowledge, much larger than at any airports for which the initial slot allocation has been previously handled through optimization models), our tool has been able to provide efficient slot allocation solutions within a short amount of time (around 30 min at most for each objective or set of objectives considered).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we focus on slot allocation objectives and, especially, on the objectives we had to incorporate into PSAM to account for the additional criteria specified in the ====. Section 3 contains a comprehensive description of the decision-support tool and of the underlying optimization model. In particular, we describe here the methods used within the tool to generate and analyze slot allocation solutions. In Section 4, we provide detailed information on Guarulhos – in particular, information concerning the declared capacities and slot requests in the Winter season of 2018/2019. Results obtained for this airport through our decision-support tool are reported and discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the article with a summary of the main features of the decision-support tool and of expected future developments.====To conclude this introductory section, we underline that the tool we have developed is not yet ready to “stand-alone”, i.e., to be used by slot coordinators in an independent way. Before this happens, we want to test it in real-life conditions. This was expected to take place last May in France for the Winter Season 2020/2021 focusing on two of the main airports under COHOR coordination (Paris Charles de Gaulle and Lyon Saint Exupéry). However, the covid-19 pandemic forced us to change our plans. Despite slot allocation issues did not disappear with the pandemic, the environment of instability and concern that currently affects the air transport industry is not ideal for this kind of experiments. Consequently, we have postponed the testing until aviation is back (or more close) to normalcy.","Towards a decision-support tool for airport slot allocation: Application to Guarulhos (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000314,16 March 2021,2021,Research Article,209.0

While its impact on air traffic remains unclear, flight shame has forced the airline ==== to react and better understand its origin. In this research, building on the growing literature on ","Increasing numbers of citizens feel concerned about the environmental impact of air transport; thus, the need for frequent flying has become an issue in Europe (Gössling et al., 2019). This concern has led to the development of a phenomenon that was initially described in Scandinavian countries as “flygskam”, which means the shame of flying (Flaherty and Holmes, 2020). According to advocates of flight shame, reducing flights would significantly reduce carbon emissions, thus limiting global warming.====Over the last few years, flight shaming has gained momentum on social networks while also benefiting from extensive coverage in the press (Becken et al., in press; Mkono, 2020). Nevertheless, its impact on air traffic remains uncertain, with strong differences observed among countries. Independent of its actual impact, flight shame has forced several European governments to take measures to reduce the environmental footprint of the air transport industry through the implementation of additional taxes or bans on domestic flights below a given range. As they face growing criticism and become increasingly stigmatized for their environmental impact (Gössling et al., 2020), airlines and airports must understand how and why the flight shame phenomenon emerged to address this issue (Roulet, 2020).====To date, because flight shame is a recent phenomenon, a limited number of published research articles have discussed this phenomenon (Flaherty and Holmes, 2020; Gossling et al., 2020; Mkono, 2020). Most of these contributions attempt to understand this phenomenon by defining what flygskam or flight shame truly means and how it has developed over recent months or years (Flaherty and Holmes, 2020; Mkono, 2020; Becken et al., in press). The contribution of Gossling et al. (2020) highlights the implications of flight shame in terms of the evolution of social norms and notes that it has not significantly changed the actual behavior of air travelers in Germany. However, while they clearly define the phenomenon, most of these articles have paid limited attention to the roots or drivers of flight shame. Understanding why consumers and citizens can become ashamed when they fly is essential for airlines to understand how to react to this phenomenon.====In this research, we argue that the growing literature on industry and organizational stigma (Devers et al., 2008; Roulet, 2020) can shed a useful light on this phenomenon. More precisely, this notion of industry or organizational stigma refers to a collective perception that an organization or an industry possesses a fundamental flaw that discredits the organization or the industry (Zhang et al., 2020). As such, the flight shame phenomenon could be analyzed as a type of industry stigma that affects its organizations (airlines, airports, manufacturers, etc.). Among the different factors explaining the emergence of these types of stigma, Hampel and Tracey (2017) argue that some firms or industries are stigmatized because their stakeholders do not correctly perceive the intentions and practices of the stigmatized firms. As pointed out by various contributions regarding the lack of “carbon literacy” of consumers (Sharp and Wheeler, 2013; Howell, 2018), we assume that a potential explanation of flight shame can be a lack of knowledge or literacy regarding the actual environmental impact of air transport. This absence of knowledge can lead to distorted public perceptions of the environmental impact of air transport with citizens that either under- or overestimate the carbon footprint of air transport. Accordingly, we suggest that flight shame could be explained by a distorted perception of the environmental impact of air transport. Thus, in this research, we investigate the level of knowledge of the environmental footprint of air transport.====To provide answers to our research question, we developed and administered a survey to a sample of 1018 respondents who are representative of the French population. In this survey, several questions were asked regarding the perceived contribution of air transport to global carbon emissions and concerning the evolution of these emissions over time. We reveal that respondents strongly overestimate the contribution of air transport to global carbon emissions and underestimate the progress made by the industry to cut carbon emissions. Based on these distorted perceptions, we draw lessons for airlines and for the air transport industry to cope with the growing trend of flight shame in Europe.",Where does flygskam come from?

Based on previous research on airline PSO networks applied to the case studies of the Azores and Norway, optimization models are adapted to minimize not only the cost to the airline, but also the total social costs. Different predictive models to estimate demand are developed and included in the optimization models. It is found that after applying the developed demand and optimization models, the total network costs can be reduced significantly, compared to the actual network's operation ranging from 4% to 20%.","Airports are key drivers of economic development for their respective catchment area (ACI, 2004; Halpern and Bråthen, 2011; Lieshout, 2012) and are usually accompanied by big investments in airline carriers that can make them international connection points (Lohmann et al., 2009). Airliners' business has high costs and low profit margins involved, making it crucial for an airline's long-term survival to use its resources in the most optimal way possible. There is extensive literature analyzing options to increase the operating margins of airlines (Zou and Chen, 2017; Raynes and Tsui, 2019; Merkert and Swidan, 2019) and optimize their flight scheduling and fleet assignment (FSFA). The objective of that research is to reduce the total operational cost for an airline, as this reduction contributes significantly to a better balance sheet of airline companies. The result is usually the suppression of frequencies in less profitable routes and allocation of the resources to the most profitable ones. However, there are other routes, the main objective of which is not to maximize profits but to provide accessibility to remote areas, and where there is not enough demand for profitable airline operation. Nonetheless, this operation is vital for local communities, and in these networks, the objective is not exclusively to minimize costs, but also to maximize air connectivity provided to passengers. In this research area, there is comparatively less published literature, with an opportunity for important contributions.====The Public Service Obligation (PSO) classification is a tool that can be used by the European states, in order to promote the economic development of regions which may require assistance, besides the normal self-regulation imposed by that market. This is achieved by subsidizing the operation of airline routes in areas where such operation is not profitable but are necessary to allow for businesses to develop, and for residents to have accessibility to the important economic centers adjacent to their region. This grants a subsidy to the operation of an airline, in order to make it profitable to operate, at reasonable ticket prices. All the requirements and conditions to impose these networks are defined by the European Commission's regulation No 1008/2008 (European Commission, 2008).====Currently there are over 170 PSO networks in operation throughout Europe (European Commission, 2019), mostly composed of domestic routes distributed by 8 EU countries plus Iceland and Norway. The most obvious regions where this may be required and which accounts for the majority of PSO networks in force is in islands. Due to their geographical characteristics, they are prone to requiring subsidies for scheduled airline service to be profitable. Nevertheless, there are also several PSO networks, which do not involve islands but require such networks to connect remote areas with adjacent economic centers. As such, the imposition of scheduled airline services is used by the legislators of the European Commission as a tool to promote the development of smaller and usually less populated areas. This scheme has already obtained verifiable positive results since the initial implementation, such as stronger connectivity to important centers for the residents and development of tourism in remote areas where a PSO service was implemented (Wittman et al., 2016).====The basic principles that support the European PSO system are (ERAA, 2016):====There are two types of PSOs: i) Open PSO (22.1% of total European PSO air routes), i.e. any air carrier can operate the PSO if it complies with their requirements, with no exclusivity nor compensation granted; and ii) Restricted PSO (77.9% of total European PSO air routes), i.e. in case no air carrier is interested in operating the route on which the obligations have been imposed, the state concerned may restrict the access to the route to a single air carrier and compensate its operational losses resulting from the PSO. In Restricted PSO, the selection of the operator must be made by public tender at Community level and only one air carrier can operate the PSO, and if exclusivity is not enough to ensure the financial viability of service, then compensation is awarded.====Several regulatory frameworks exist for the support of routes that are not economically viable and are less attractive for airlines to operate. In Europe, the Public Service Obligation (PSO) system allows for national or regional governments to setup PSO networks and awards exclusivity of the operation to the carrier which wins the tender for the period of the contract (European Commission, 2008). The equivalent scheme in the United States of America is applied slightly differently and is called “Essential Air Services” (EAS) (US Department of Transportation, 2017), while in Australia appears as the “Remote Air Service Subsidy” (RASS) (Australian Department of Infrastructure, 2020). Although these three subsidy programs have the same overall purpose, they were implemented in different ways, with different guidelines. Even inside the PSO system within Europe, though under the same subsidy framework, each country has used it in different ways (Williams and Pagliari, 2004; Santana, 2009). Some countries use the PSO scheme in sparse regions of the country, to link remote regions between themselves (as is the example of Norway); while France, on the other hand, uses the PSO scheme to connect smaller regions with Paris, in an effort to promote economic activity in the remote regions, by connecting them to the business centers of the country (Skreikes, 2003). Another example of different adoption of the PSO scheme is given by the United Kingdom, which focused its PSO network on setting up mostly “lifeline” types of services, allowing the population of remote regions to reach a city with more facilities (e.g. hospitals) whenever necessary, not focusing on setting up routes for economic development.====As stated above, the airline business operates in an economically and operationally challenging environment, with high costs and comparatively low profit margins. Although the airlines that operate within PSO networks are financially rewarded for their service, it remains critical for them to operate as efficiently as possible, in order to maximize economic results. On the other hand, the entity responsible for subsidizing the PSO network (usually national or regional government entities) is focused on maximizing the quality of service provided to the users, but is also interested in minimizing the cost of subsidies that it must provide to the airline operating the route. Hence, solving the Integrated Flight Scheduling Fleet Assignment problem (IFSFA), is the suitable tool to optimize such networks.====The IFSFA model builds on the FSFA (which is only focused on airline cost reduction) by adding the minimization of the costs associated with the passenger (financial and connectivity costs), allowing for a more holistic view of the concept of an optimal network which aims not only to reduce costs but also maximize air connectivity. This is very important because these networks are, by definition, sub-optimal as flights are imposed on routes that do not have enough demand to justify their operation. Moreover, if a normal FSFA model was applied to these networks, the result would be a significant reduction in the quality of service provided, which might even violate the minimum frequencies defined by the entity which imposed the PSO, in an attempt to reduce the cost for the airline.====This problem has already been explored in the literature (Pita et al., 2013, 2014) with very positive results, reducing both financial costs for the airline and time costs for the passengers. Therefore, the purpose of the present research is to build on the model developed in Pita et al. (2013) and adapt it in order to apply it to part of the PSO network of the Greek islands by adding the objective of minimizing the connection time of passengers. Therefore, initially the model developed is implemented using a slightly different formulation, and tested through an illustrative example, which will be used to verify the results and demonstrate the capabilities of the model. Then, the model is applied to design two PSO networks in Greece using data provided by the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority (HCAA) and by Aegean airlines. The model will be further developed to account for the specific characteristics of the PSO network of the Greek islands (e.g. seasonality effects or the specific restrictions of smaller Greek airports).====This paper is structured in seven sections. Section 1 provided an introduction to the PSO topic in airline networks, detailing specific aspects and objectives of a PSO network. Then, section 2 provides a review of the research conducted in the most prominent scientific papers in this area. Section 3 presents the optimization model and its mathematical formulation. An illustrative example is also explored to provide clear understanding on the variables involved. Section 4 presents the two suggested networks detailing the costs associated with each of them. Section 5 explores the predictive models used to estimate demand providing a comprehensive description of the complete process of building such models. Section 6 presents the results obtained by applying the optimization model to the two case studies detailing the costs of the optimized networks, and their key features, while comparing the optimal solutions with the current network designs (previously explored in section 4).

It covers a geographical area of 3.28 million km====, making it the seventh-largest country in the world. It is also the world's second-most populous country with a population of 1.353 billion in 2018 (World Bank, 2018). It is the third-largest economy by purchasing power parity (PPP), with a gross domestic product (GDP) of about 9.058 trillion Int$ (PPP $ - International dollar) in 2018 (World Bank, 2018). As India seeks to grow its economy at the desired rates, the aviation sector's careful expansion is given utmost importance. India sees an extraordinary growth in its aviation sector driven by factors such as Low-Cost Carriers, modern airports, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), advanced Information Technology interventions with a growing emphasis on regional connectivity, as part of National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP)-2016 (Airports Authority of India, 2017). According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), India will displace the UK for third place in 2025 in terms of overall air passenger traffic. The domestic, as well as international traffic, has been increasing at a fast rate in India. Domestic passenger traffic (shown in Fig. 1) grew year-over-year (YoY) by 18.28% to reach 243 million in FY18 (Financial year 2018), while international passenger grew YoY by 10.43% to reach 65.48 million in FY18 (India Brand Equity Foundation IBEF, 2018). The traffic is growing in all the three segments-passenger, freight and aircraft movement.====There were 106 operational airports in India by the end of 2019. These airports consist of 20 international airports, 7 joint venture international airports, 10 custom airports, 59 domestic airports and 10 state government/private airports (Airports Authority of India, 2019). The total number of airports is expected to increase as the Airports Authority of India (AAI) plans to develop 100 airports, waterdromes, and heliports by 2024. Despite this remarkable growth, India has an average of 0.08 air trips per capita (Das et al., 2020; Hakim and Merkert, 2019) and most of the airports remain untapped and under-served. The number of domestic journeys undertaken in 2017 is just 7.3% of India's total population (International Air Transport Association , 2018). These facts indicate the potential of India in the aviation market, particularly in the domestic market segment.====To connect the remote areas, which are very rich in forests and natural resources, the Government of India set up Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) in March 1994. This scheme forces airlines to distribute traﬃc across three categories of airports: Category I, II and III. Category I includes routes from major airports to other large cities. Category II includes airports in the North-Eastern region, Jammu and Kashmir, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep, which are geographically remote areas. The airports and routes other than those in I and II are included in Category III. Certainly, RDGs have provided the initial impetus to air connectivity in remote regions (Government of India, 2014) through internal cross-subsidy by airlines using their revenues on the trunk routes (Government of India, 2016b). The scheme was modified in 2016 to include other remote regions (Government of India, 2016c) but did not give importance to regional airport development.====The Indian Government, then, launched the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) in October 2016 to ensure that air travel becomes affordable for the common people, promote tourism, increase employment opportunities and promote balanced regional economic growth. RCS, presented by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), refers to the operation of an air transport service between two airports, of which the central government has declared at least one as unserved or under-served (Government of India, 2016a). Under-served airports are airports with no more than seven flights a week, and unserved airports have no flights during the last two flight schedules. RCS connects selected under-served or unserved airports, called RCS airports, to major airports. RCS Airports are licensed/approved airports by DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation), for which the State Government and airport owner/operator have extended concessions and support measures as specified under National Civil Aviation Policy, NCAP 2016. The concessions offered are Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) excise duty at the rate of 2% by the Central Government, reduction of VAT (Value Added Tax) to 1% or less on ATF by the State Government, provision of minimum land free of cost, multi-modal hinterland connectivity (road, rail, metro, waterways, etc.) as required, provision of fire services and security free of cost, provision of electricity, water and other utility services at substantially concessional rates (Government of India, 2016a). So far, this scheme has been very successful in linking smaller airports (under-served and unserved) to India's aviation map in two ways. The first, by operationalizing existing regional airports (Salem Airport in Tamil Nadu, Shimla Airport in Himachal Pradesh, Jaisalmer Airport in Rajasthan, Mysore Airport in Karnataka etc.) and introducing new airports (Pakyong airport in Sikkim). The second is by starting new flight routes connecting under-served and unserved airports with each other as well as with major airports (Bhatinda-Delhi, Kadapa-Hyderabad, Mysore-Chennai, Jaisalmer-Jaipur, Jalgaon-Mumbai, Shillong-Agartala, Raipur-Jagdalpur, Allahabad-Patna etc.). Around 50 unserved and under-served airports (including five heliports) with 285 routes have been added under RCS across the length and breadth of India. Thus, the scheme could provide connectivity to remote locations and boost the local economy. It is time that we study and propose suitable mechanisms to promote air transport demand in smaller regional airports effectively.====Although considerable research in air transport demand has been done in major metropolitan areas, less attention has been paid to regional airports. There is a dearth of literature on assessing the value of regional aviation, even though air services provide essential economic and social benefits to a country. Regional airports have been defined in different ways worldwide. The term, ‘regional airport’, is not clearly defined (Graham and Guyer, 2000). In addition to regional airports, other terms such as small airports (Adler et al., 2013), local airports (Bloice et al., 2017), secondary airports (Dziedzic and Warnock-Smith, 2016; Jimenez et al., 2017), remote and rural airports (Donehue and Baker, 2012; Bloice et al., 2017; Jimenez et al., 2017) are often used interchangeably. While some countries define regional airports as airports with low traffic volume, others see them as airports located at remote areas. There is still no global consensus on the definition of regional airports. In Australia, regional airports refer to all airports located in regional areas that constitute four classes-inner regional, outer regional, remote and very remote Australia, according to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) Remoteness Structure (BITRE, 2008). In this paper, regional airports are those non-hub airports that do not generate sufficient demand to attract airlines, and that may be under-served, located at places with challenging geography and topography, but need not be necessarily far from towns/cities. Hence, considering the non-hub nature of airports with low traffic volume, this study focuses on airports with less than three million passengers per annum. Recent research on Indian aviation is focused on large international airports (Chakraborty et al., 2020) and the lessons learnt from the new regional aviation policy in India-Regional Connectivity Scheme (Das et al., 2020). The present study is one of the first studies in India, which models domestic air traffic demand in regional airports. As domestic traffic in India continues to grow rapidly as shown in Fig. 1, the contribution of regional airports cannot be ignored, and there is an increasing need to examine the determinants of air traffic demand in such airports.====This research paper is organized as follows. The following section consists of a review of the literature on regional airports. The research methodology is explained along with the development of the model in Section 3. The results of the study are interpreted and discussed in the subsequent section.

In addition, the presented concept of “generated delay” classifies airports as affecting other airport delays or affected by other airport delays. The generated delay refers to the delay time at a particular airport/route, and this delay thereafter actually propagates to other airports/routes. In this study, the generated and propagated delays were displayed on a two-dimensional graph, and the airports/routes were grouped according to delay characteristics. Group A represented airports with high generated and propagated delays, and group B represented airports that are highly affected by delays of preceding airports/routes. Group C represents airports where newly formed delays affect other airport delays, but these airports mitigate delays from other airports. Airports in group D have relatively low delays and propagation. Thus, we targeted airports belonging to groups A and C because of their delay propagation impact on other routes/airports, which must be reduced by decreasing the root delay from targeted routes/airports. Among the airports, Jeju international airport (CJU) had the highest average delay time and propagated flight delay time with similar averaged generated delay times. Among the routes, departure flights from various airports to CJU had significant propagation effects on the subsequent flights. CJU and related routes have a very large impact on domestic flight delays because South Korean domestic airline routes are concentrated on CJU. However, there has been no quantitative analysis, and it is meaningful that the quantitative analysis results were presented in this study. In addition, we suggest that other airports such as GMP (Gimpo), CJJ (Cheongju), WJU (Wonju), and KUV (Gunsan) have a significant impact on domestic flight delays.","Unlike roads and railroads, where V/C (traffic volume versus capacity) has the greatest effect on delay, flight delays are complexly affected by various causes such as aircraft, airports, airlines, crews, passengers, and weather conditions. In addition, flight delays occur owing to various events such as disconnection of access transportation, terrorist attack, strikes, or runway and taxiway accidents. In addition, flight delay has a great influence on the subsequent flight schedules because of the limitations in operating alternative aircrafts. Thus, flight delay management is becoming more important in the air transportation business to facilitate consumer protection and efficient operation of airports and airlines with a continuous increase in number of air passengers.====The flight delay can be divided into root (newly formed) and propagated delays. Root delay analysis focuses on flight delay reasons and sources (airports or airlines), and delay propagation analysis concentrates on how the initial delay affects the subsequent route/airport delays. Flight delay propagation can be generated on various root delay causes and the characteristics of the following routes/airports.====There are various methods to analyze flight delay depending on the objectives of the research, statistical analysis, probabilistic models, network representation, operational research, and machine learning (Sternberg et al., 2017). Statistical analysis encompasses the regression, econometric models, and statistical tests. Various statistical models using various factors such as airport, airline, time slot, fleet size, occupancy, block and turnaround time (B/T==== and G/T====) as independent variables have been developed and applied for this purpose (Xiong and Hansen, 2013; Hao et al., 2014; Ding, 2017). Similarly, probabilistic models estimate the probability or distribution of flight delays (Wesonga et al., 2012; Pérez–Rodríguez et al., 2017; Kim and Bae, 2021). Moreover, network representation is based on graph theory, which displays the network as nodes and lines (Abdelghany et al., 2004; AhmadBeygi et al., 2008). Operation research and machine learning perform delay propagation analysis and prediction using optimization, simulation, and queuing theory (Hansen, 2002; Hansen et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2017; Gui et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019). We can apply these results as basic data for the analysis of delay characteristics or delay prediction of certain airports/regions.====However, these studies have limitations that they analyzed the entire network macroscopically or only analyzed specific airports/regions. In this study, we divided flight delay into newly formed and propagated delays, and analyzed airports/routes that have a great influence on actual flight delay using flight operation data (tower-logs) for South Korean domestic flights. In addition, the newly presented concept of “generated delay” classifies airports as either affecting other airport delays or affected by other airport delays. The generated delay refers to the total delay time at an airport/route, which actually propagated to other airports/routes. We suggested a quantitative analysis and classification methodology for the airport/route that needs to be improved by selecting airports/routes having a significant delay propagation from/to other airports/routes.====In South Korea, there are 15 airports—out of which eight airports are international airports and seven airports are domestic airports (Fig. 1====). This research is performed on all airports/routes in South Korea, including the departure and arrival routes. Among them, Jeju international airport (CJU) deals with around 40.3% of domestic flights in 2019 and is selected as one of the world's heavily congested routes (Sun, 2020). Therefore, in this study, we determined target airports/routes in South Korea based on actual propagated and generated delays of South Korean domestic airports/routes to confirm whether the CJU related routes exhibited a huge delay propagation to other airports/routes.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the flight delay propagation model using flight operation data. In section 3, we present the data and process used for actual analysis.

Several ride-related factors (such as month of the year, day of the week and time of the day) and weather-related variables (such as temperature, weather conditions and visibility) are used as predictors for four popular MLAs, namely, logistic regression, artificial ====, random forests, and gradient boosting. Experimental results suggest gradient boosting to consistently provide higher prediction performance. Specific locations, certain time periods and weekdays consistently emerged as critical predictors.","In recent years, urban air mobility (UAM), an emerging aviation transportation system that strives to commute passenger or cargo by air using low-altitude aircraft, is being widely investigated (Rajendran and Shulman, 2020; Straubinger et al., 2020). With the radical expansion of the aviation industry (Matsumoto and Domae, 2018), several logistics companies are venturing into this nascent market (Rajendran and Pagel, 2020). Air taxi, a form of on-demand UAM service, is expected to launch in the forthcoming years as a fast, safe and efficient mode of transport for everyday commuters in urban and semi-urban areas (Holden and Goel, 2016). These are compact aircraft that operate using the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology and have an average capacity of four passengers (Rajendran and Zack, 2019). Thus, the goal of the electric flying taxi services is to not only provide a significantly faster commute, but also to operate in a sustainable manner. Air taxis could also serve as a potential travel option for people commuting outside of regular work hours by easing the process of traveling in and out of the metropolitan cities for entertainment purposes, such as sports events or nightlife activities (Holden et al., 2018).====Several companies like Uber, Zephyr Airworks, and Airbus are planning to launch their next form of urban on-demand aviation ride service for citizens in highly condensed cities. They have also discussed their eVTOL design concepts and how the prototypes would be tested; however, city planners are still in the process of taking measures to accommodate this new mode of commute (Garrett-Glaser, 2019). Thus, it is essential to predict the demand for these air taxi services to enable manufacturing companies, investors, and city planners to be equipped with the necessary measures for the launch of this aviation operation.====Two types of physical infrastructure assets are proposed for air taxi operations in the literature, namely, ==== (Smith, 1994; Patnoe, 2018; Hasan, 2019). Vertistop is a sophisticated rooftop helipad that typically handles a single air taxi eVTOL at a time. These facilities enable air taxis to land and take off relatively quickly with the sole purpose of embarking/disembarking passengers. On the other hand, vertiport is a larger infrastructure and can accommodate multiple eVTOLs at a given time. Aside from having numerous landing-pad structures for serving customers, other air taxi operations, such as vehicle inspection and maintenance, charging, and docking, are also conducted at vertiports. These stations could either be retrofitted on larger buildings or operate on other infrastructures, such as highway roundabouts and open parking lots (Holden et al., 2018).====The air taxi system operations are expected to be integrated with public transportation or on-demand taxi services, thereby leading to an on-demand door-to-door multi-leg multi-modal transportation (Rajendran and Srinivas, 2020). Specifically, most rides are likely to include three legs or segments, as shown in Fig. 1. The first-leg transport consists of customer travel from his/her actual pickup location (such as home and office) to a nearby skyport (i.e., vertiport or vertistop). In the main leg, the customer is flown by air taxi to the destination skyport. Finally, the customer is transported to the actual drop-off location in the third segment. The commute choice for the first and last legs of the trip could include walking, on-demand regular taxi services like Uber or Lyft, subway, and bus.====Although air taxis have the potential to be a convenient mode of transportation for commuters in metropolitan cities, there are several challenges associated with their implementation (Rajendran and Zack, 2019; Straubinger et al., 2020). For instance, it is essential to establish a system that will make smart real-time dispatching and routing decisions to mitigate customer ride time and costs. Moreover, the scheduling systems should ensure that flight operations are optimized to increase the demand fulfillment rate. The estimation of passenger demand for air taxi services across time and space is crucial to address the challenges mentioned above and aid several other critical decisions (such as fleet procurement and pricing).====This study aims to develop a data-driven machine-learning-based approach for estimating the spatiotemporal air taxi demand level (low, moderate, or high) using the data established by a prior study on air taxi network design (Rajendran and Zack, 2019). Several ride-related (e.g., pickup and drop-off locations, distance, time of the day, day of the week) and environment-related (e.g., temperature, presence of rain, or snow, visibility) factors are derived from the dataset as well as a commercial weather service provider and used as predictors for machine learning algorithms.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. A detailed review of the literature on existing and emerging urban on-demand mobility services are discussed in Section 2. The description of the data used for this study is presented in Section 3. Machine learning algorithms for predicting the air taxi demand is discussed in Section 4. Results are presented in Section 5, while the discussions are detailed in Section 6.

As airports provide a unique retailing environment that differs from the day-to-day distribution channels, observation of travelers' shopping behavior in airports shows that it is different from that in traditional retail store environments. Duty-free retailers at airports must recognize this specific shopping behavior to maximize their sales performance. We examine the relationship between two different types of ","In recent years, China has become home to the largest number of outbound travelers in the world, with more than 154 million travelers visiting other countries in 2019. These travelers spent 131 billion USD, comprising 16% of all global travel spending in 2019 (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2019). Considering households' increased disposal income, longer leisure hours, marketing efforts of destination countries, and reinforcement of international political and economic collaboration, China's outbound tourism market is showing potential to accelerate in the future (Jin et al., 2014). According to China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (2018), with the numbers growing, an estimated 400 million outbound Chinese travelers are expected in 2030, and this forecast is envisioned before the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, Chinese tourists typically spend 25% of their total travel expenditure on shopping, averaging 762 USD per person while traveling overseas. In contrast, non-Chinese tourists spend only 15% of total travel expenditure on shopping, averaging 486 USD per traveler during overseas travel (Nielsen report, 2017). According to Accenture research (2018), 84% of Chinese travelers buy at airport duty-free stores or on flights, compared to 67% international travelers. Morgan Stanley Research (2020) projects China's duty-free sector to quadruple by 2025, and outbound tourists will account for a third of worldwide duty-free spend. Thus, airport duty-free shopping is regarded as an important source of income, primarily attributable to Chinese travelers. For example, South Korea's Incheon International Airport, ranked number one airport for duty-free sales in 2018, reported 2.4 billion USD in sales, with 32% derived from Chinese travelers (The Moodie Davitt report, 2019). Recent research (Choi et al., 2020) shows that low-cost carrier (LCC) passengers displayed higher purchasing power from duty-free stores at the Incheon international airport as most of them are Chinese travelers. Martín et al. (2019) analyzed the satisfaction of airport duty-free shoppers using travel patterns and a six-item construct, which showed high satisfaction of travelers as residence with short route trips, and high satisfaction elasticity of the variety of items available in shops and the choice of international brands, while less elastic with respect to the ease with which specific items as well as the “look and feel” of shops. The Airport Council International Report (2016) indicated the growing importance of non-aviation revenue, accounting for as much as 40% of total airport revenue. Moreover, airport shopping is a valuable segment for tourist destinations (Lyu and Noh, 2017; Lee and Kim, 2018). Therefore, airports are seeking new methods of maximizing revenue and focusing on making efforts to increase profits from non-aviation revenue rather than aviation revenue.(see Fig. 1, Fig. 2)====Airports are unique retailing environments where travelers experience feelings of anxiety, stress, and excitement, and all these emotions lead to unconventional behaviors (Crawford and Melewar, 2003). Therefore, unlike general shoppers in high-street situations, airport shoppers are different (Lin and Chen, 2013). This is because airports offer unique circumstances that can trigger compulsive buying behavior, with highly impulsive shoppers being especially receptive to sudden, unexpected purchasing ideas (Omar and Kent, 2001). According to Crawford and Melewar (2003), impulsive buying results from the unusual and restricted situational conditions prevailing in international airport environments. Understanding the impulsive buying characteristics of travelers and uncovering repetitive patterns in such behaviors would provide valuable information to duty-free retailers and potentially enhance the financial outcomes of stores (Sohn and Lee, 2017).====According to previous research works on impulse buying theory (Beatty and Ferrell, 1998; Rook and Fisher, 1995; Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001), compulsive buying includes both cognitive aspects such as deliberation, thinking, lack of planning, and affective aspects such as pleasure, excitement, and guilt. Such impulse buying behaviors can be applied to travelers who experience different moods, emotions, purpose, and situations in airport duty-free shopping.====In addition, other variables that affect impulse buying behavior are travelers’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, which are related to internal psychological stimuli experienced by travelers in the airport duty-free shopping context. Self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, 1985) distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations based on different reasons or goals that give rise to action. Deci and Ryan (1985) posit that intrinsic motivation is defined as doing something for inherent gratification rather than any separable consequence, and extrinsic motivation refers to an activity that is done to attain some separable outcome. From a retail perspective, extrinsic motivation is derived from shopping trips that are utilitarian in nature while intrinsic motivation results from the appreciation of an experience apart from any other consequence (Holbrook and Elizabeth, 1982; Holbrook, 1994). Therefore, this study hypothesizes that intrinsic and extrinsic motivations have a prominent role in influencing impulsive buying behaviors, satisfaction, and loyalty in the context of airport duty-free shopping.====This study investigates the relationship between travelers' impulse buying urges and satisfaction with using the moderating role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in airport duty-free shopping. This study aims to (1) provide a better understanding on cognitive and affective type of impulsive buying behaviors lead to traveler satisfaction, (2) to reveal the moderating roles of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on impulse buying behaviors and travelers' satisfaction in airport duty-free shopping, and (3) to identify whether travelers' satisfaction in airport duty-free shopping generates loyalty toward this shopping behavior that is distinct from a normal shopping environment.

We account for the distressed carrier's survival network design strategies (SNDS) pursued during its reorganization—a suspected source of ,"A staple of the air transportation industry since deregulation, bankruptcies have never ceased to catch regulators, governments, and the public off guard (Davalos et al., 1999; Gong, 2007). European carriers Air Berlin's, Monarch Airlines', and Primera Air's collapses in the late 2010s illustrate just that, as they burden the taxpayers and leave thousands of stranded passengers behind (====, February 9, 2018).====With fuel prices, pilot wages, and borrowing costs on the rise to blame for many of these casualties (====, October 22, 2018), not to mention the impacts of intense competition, merger talks between rivals should not be too surprising—even when failing to materialize.==== The industry's “inevitable” trend of consolidation, as frequently suggested by European airline executives (====, March 7, 2018; ====, October 30, 2018), remains, however, a possibility, while a certain sense of ==== to the merger and acquisition (henceforth merger) waves that took place in the US in the 80s and the 2000s and 2010s is brought to mind.====Focusing on the past decade, in the US, ten airlines were merged into four, as a series of major bankruptcies led to a second merger wave. Once again, the industry's attention was turned into a “market survival vs. market power” dilemma—whether the bankrupt airline should be left to its own resources, possibly ceasing its operations in the process, or whether it should be allowed to join efforts with a rival. Concerns of entry restrictions, downgraded quality, and higher fares were set aside, as the removal of the failing firms' assets was deemed more harmful for the market.====While setting out to take a closer look at the aftermath of those events, researchers have so far weighted more towards the consolidations in themselves—e.g., Kim and Singal (1993) and Peters (2006) on mergers from the first wave, and Hüschelrath and Müller (2014) on mergers from the second. Despite their relevance, however, differing circumstances to which the failing firms were subjected to have been left out of the equation, most prominent being the influences on competition by their bankruptcy filings and by the degree of deterioration of their financial health.====Given that, we aim at addressing the following research question: “====” We employ Brazilian domestic air transportation data corresponding to the period between 2002 and 2009, including the events of the bankruptcy of the full-service carrier (FSC) Varig, in 2005, and its acquisition by low-cost carrier (LCC) Gol, in 2007.====As prior research has found evidence of considerable network reductions made by bankrupt carriers, specifically in periods preceding their filings (Lee, 2010; Ciliberto and Schenone, 2012), support is on hand for the hypothesis that distressed companies selectively reduce their networks, making ends meet by allocating their resources in their most profitable routes. These survival network design strategies (SNDS, as we will call) may come at a cost, however, since reductions in their number of destinations may negatively affect these companies' network attractiveness to customers while also impairing their competitive advantages—arising, for example, from lower costs associated with economies of scope. On the other hand, these strategies may prove to be an unambiguous signal of weakness to their rivals, turning them into easier preys. We suggest that the distressed/bankrupt carrier may put into practice a survival pricing behavior stemming from these SNDS, and that rival airlines, once aware of these network adjustments, may respond more aggressively with prices on routes perceived as having a higher probability of exit by this carrier. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has considered this nonrandom selection of markets by financially distressed/bankrupt airlines. As the said airlines are typically forced to reevaluate continually the markets they operate in, the issue of sample selection bias becomes especially relevant, posing significant challenges to the understanding of the effects of bankruptcies.====Methodological contributions are further provided as we investigate the (possibly) endogenous relationship between financial distress and airfares. This hypothesis is motivated by the contention that low market prices may drive firms into financial distress, while the latter may induce the distressed (or already bankrupt) firm towards an aggressive pricing behavior and a spiral of price responses by rivals. In this context, these responses could be triggered by a goal of either keeping the existing market shares or even driving the distressed carrier out of the market altogether. The reader is referred to Barla and Koo (1999) and Hofer et al. (2009) for additional discussions concerning financial distress as a consequence or as a cause of price competition.====To sum up, our study makes three main contributions: (1) we develop a unifying approach to investigate the effects on airfares of a company's financial distress and both its bankruptcy filing and acquisition events in one econometric framework; (2) we explicitly account for the possible endogenous relation between the distressed company's financial condition and its rivals' airfares; and (3) given the SNDS undertaken by the distressed company in response to changes in its financial health, we extend the previous literature by considering a model that accounts for nonrandom, bankruptcy-related network adjustments that may bias the estimates.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature regarding the effects of bankruptcies, financial health, and mergers on airfares. Moreover, results related to network adjustments and the financial condition of airlines are also discussed. This review is accompanied in Section 3 by a historical account of the sample carriers in the period analyzed.

A macroscopic empirical approach is proposed in this paper to estimate the capacity penalties and demonstrated by a numerical case study for Beijing, which is projected to become one of the busiest metroplexes in Asia. The Pareto envelopes of the theoretical and observed peak hour capacities are statistically analysed to quantify the penalties in a comparable metroplex and are subsequently modulated by a sigmoid correlation function. The analysis predicts the practical capacity of Daxing, the penalty incurred by the pre-existing Capital airport and by the total multi-airport system. Various findings are drawn and discussed, highlighting the needs for further research.","Air transport demand is growing in direct relation with the current global development rate (Bonnefoy, 2008). As a result, ever more often, metropolitan areas are served by two or more commercial airports in proximity to each other. In relation to the various commonly encountered operational issues (JPDO, 2011), multi-airport systems served by the same terminal airspace control facility have been denominated ==== in the United States (US). The terminal airspace control facility is tasked to manage arrival and departure flows, which are frequently intersecting and are characterised by multiple changes of altitude and direction, increasing the traffic complexity (Delahaye and Puechmorel, 2010). These arrival and departure traffic flows need to be either geographically separated (by subdividing entry and exit points and corridors across the different airports) or functionally shared with the adoption of time slotting on the shared entry and exit corridors (Sidiropoulos et al., 2017). In both cases, additional operational interdependencies are introduced with respect to the case of a single major airport not sharing terminal airspace (Li and Ryerson, 2017). These additional interdependencies restrict the usable maximum arrival and departure throughputs and introduce potential delays, so that the theoretical capacity of each airport is not fully available for exploitation (Idris, 2010). Moreover, highly coupled operations are associated with more frequent traffic interactions, hence increasing the traffic complexity, which negatively affects airspace capacity and operational efficiency, particularly in the current largely manual, voice communication-based and highly tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) paradigm (Kistan et al., 2017). With the emergence of secondary airports in the US and globally, the coupling of terminal operations has been increasing significantly, triggering many issues such as airport congestions and extreme traffic complexities (Bonnefoy, 2005). As metroplexes become more and more common and their traffic grows, effective measures are required to relieve traffic complexity, which is hazardous and a major cause of inefficiencies (DeLaurentis et al., 2011), even in envisioned more automated ATC paradigms (Belle, 2012). Due to a relatively limited body of research on metroplex modelling and an inadequate planning for the growth of traffic, metroplex terminal airspaces are increasingly affected by flight delays and congestion, ultimately resulting in important economic impacts (Clarke et al., 2011). Capacity improvements by airport infrastructure investments are to be carefully evaluated considering the actual exploitable capacity gains, but currently the lack of simplified reduced-order models and of representative datasets forces airport planners to undertake lengthy and costly modelling and simulation studies, hindering the initial planning stage. Most studies in this domain focussed on specific major metroplexes around the world, but no study ultimately produced models of sufficient global applicability to efficiently evaluate the capacity penalties of future metroplexes without undertaking extensive dedicated modelling and simulation studies. It is therefore essential to develop metroplex capacity estimation strategies which do not rely on full-scale modelling and simulation analyses. This article aims to empirically quantify the actual capacity of the Beijing TMA at the time the new Daxing international airport achieves operational capability, without resorting to full-scale modelling and simulation activities. Empirical models already available in the literature and which demonstrated adequate accuracy are adopted to estimate theoretical capacities and traffic interdependencies. To capture local specificities and to extrapolate some essential parameters for the analysis, the study exploits the similarity and local specificities of another large multi-airport TMA system in mainland China, Shanghai, which also consists of two major international airports in proximity of each other. An empirical analysis of Pareto capacity envelopes is carried out to estimate arrival and departure capacity penalties through observation at aggregate and disaggregate level of the two airports. Through a correlation analysis, the empirical relationships are then applied to the Beijing multi-airport system. A direct comparison of the Beijing multi-airport system capacity with and without metroplex penalties allows to quantify the impact in absolute terms.====The article is structured as follows: the rest of this section reviews the most important and recent works relevant to this study and introduces the essential concepts.

Globalization drives the air transport ,"Managerial practices heterogeneity enhances changes in firms operating efficiency. Empirical literature confirms substantial productivity differences within a firm over time and among firms (Lieberman et al., 1990; Foster et al., 2008; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). Managerial strategic decisions influence the organisation's performance (Beck and Wiersema, 2013) since the management function becomes the fourth productive factor (Marshall and Marshall, 1881). An effective manager is a source of competitive advantage (Drucker, 2006). Managerial capabilities and managerial decisions determine the acquisition, development, and deployment of the rest of the resources to create value and, therefore, leading to the organisation's growth (Hambrick and Brandon 1988; Castanias and Helfat 1991; Camisón, 2004; Helfat and Martin 2015). The investment and utilisation of technology, along with other expenditures, are practices controlled by the management (Nallari and Bayraktar, 2010). There are studies of the significance of managerial human capital to the company's operation and development in various industries (Manevska-Tasevska, 2013; Khadka et al., 2014; Drewik et al., 2016; González-Cruz et al., 2018).====Another factor driving differences in management practices is the type of ownership, which potentially influences managerial decisions. Government-owned firms are weakly incentive overall, although market competition enhances better management practices along with the level of education of both managers and no managers (Bloom et al., 2012). Nevertheless, in the context of airport management is not extensively analysed. One potential reason is that management skills and practices are unobservable (Barros and Marques, 2010), although management practices are a core factor in explaining productivity differences (Glaister, 2014).====Airports were traditionally considered as public utilities (government-owned), with the government as the provider of infrastructure. Nevertheless, the aviation industry is changing, and so the airports. Airports are transforming themselves into complex enterprises that require a wide range of business competencies and skills (Graham, 2013). Managerial skills and expertise are an internal core source of airport competitiveness (Bednarczyk and Grabińska, 2015). Managers' characteristics such as age, sex, educational background, and industry experience understood as knowledge, skills, and competences for strategy management drive airports’ development (Nowak and Huderek-Glapska, 2019).====To the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical studies regarding human capital and airport competitiveness, performance, and efficiency. Although more diverse ownership forms co-exist, the degree of the independence of management is questionable. Some airports with mixed ownership forms may prioritise political interests rather than airports' performance and efficiency. Some evidence shows appointing managers without enough experience in the field rather than an independent professional with skills and relevant industry experience. Market-driven airports require specialist knowledge, experience, competences, and capabilities. The objectives of managers and owners may differ, which presents the typical agency and principal problem. Therefore, the impact of managerial capabilities in airports’ performance should be evaluated carefully, taking into account their business environment, including the role of Government or group management.====The study aims to analyse if managerial human capital, namely airport top managers' knowledge, and experience, and different degrees of non-privatise airports' ownership forms (state, regional, and local authorities) affect the airports' technical efficiency. The term knowledge addresses the academic-theoretical aspect, and the term experience empirical knowledge. It is expected that the more years that a manager has managed an airport, the more efficient the airport becomes. Following Battese and Coelli (1995), we perform a stochastic frontier analysis for 12 Polish airports and panel data (2009–2017), which allows the enclosing of external factors potentially affecting efficiency. The environmental variables understood as exogenous drivers of efficiency are related to management and airports’ infrastructure.====The structure of the paper follows.

Boarding strategies define rules and procedures aimed to reduce boarding time and operational cost. Most of the proposed strategies do not account for passengers’ non-compliance with boarding rules. Non-compliance is one of the major non-deterministic problems that can degrade any performance improvement to be expected from adopting a boarding strategy. To that, it is of paramount interest to shed light on this problem and introduce approaches for mitigating any related performance degradation in the boarding process. Although some recent research investigations considered the effect of non-compliance on the overall boarding time under different strategies, there was a lack of remedial actions. This paper dissects the operational characteristics of the non-compliance activity, proposes two different intervention approaches to deal with non-complying passengers, and analyzes the resulting impact under different categories of boarding strategies using a cellular-automaton-based simulation.","Aircraft boarding strategies are aimed to reduce the aircraft boarding time by adopting a set of rules and procedures to optimize the process of boarding passengers. The main objectives of such strategies are to reduce operational cost for airliners, maximize capacity utilization at airports and enhance passengers' experience (Jaehn and Neumann, 2014; Nyquist and McFadden, 2008). The boarding process in this case starts with the first passenger entering the aircraft and ends with the last passenger taking a seat, irrespective of the activities occurring before and after. Several boarding strategies have been proposed in the literature, assuming full passengers’ compliance with the rules and procedures, and ignoring the reality of some erratic human behaviors during the boarding process. Ideally, these strategies must be coupled with a tight control over passenger movements in order to achieve the best boarding time. Otherwise, best performance cannot not be guaranteed due to passengers non-compliance with the rules, that are essential to achieve ideal boarding time under a particular strategy.====Several research studies considered the impact of various factors that constrain the boarding process and degrade the benefits of boarding strategies, such as onboard interference, hand luggage, group dynamics, aircraft layout, and passengers’ non-compliance with boarding rules.====Onboard interference is one of the major factors that negatively impacts the overall boarding time. Van den Briel et al., (2003) categorized onboard interferences under two broad classes, seat or aisle interference. Bazargan (2007) presented a stochastic model to analyze the boarding process, in which he includes the interference factor. Several subsequent works addressed the interference factor and discussed approaches to mitigate its negative impact, such as the research of Kuo (2015), Soolaki et al. (2012), and Tang et al. (2012). Lately, Delcea et al. (2018) analyzed the influence of seat and aisle interferences on the boarding time using an agent-based model. Schultz (2018a) developed a metric quantifying the aircraft interference potential, and used it as a predictor for aircraft boarding time. Ren and Xu (2018) led experimental analyses of airplane boarding based on several factors including aisle and seat interference classiﬁcation, as a reference for future experimental studies.====The impact of hand luggage on the efficiency of various boarding strategies was considered in several studies. Steffen (2008) proposed a boarding strategy that ensures even spread of passengers when stowing their luggage throughout the cabin. Tang et al. (2012, 2019) considered the relationship between passenger speed and hand luggage quantity. They concluded that aisle interference increases and consequently slows down the boarding process when having more passengers with hand luggage. Milne and Kelly (2014) considered a balanced distribution of luggage throughout the cabin when allocating seats to passengers. Qiang et al. (2014) gave higher boarding priority to passengers who carry excessive luggage, in an attempt to improve boarding. Later in 2016, Qiang et al. noted that Outside-In and Reverse Pyramid strategies are less sensitive to luggage distribution and cabin occupancy rate. Milne and Salari (2016) used the amount of hand luggage as a decisive factor for allocating seats to passengers. Notomista et al. (2016) allocated seats to passengers only after they cross the boarding gate, based on the person's speed and size of hand luggage, to achieve a significant decrease in the boarding time. Gwynne et al. (2018), through a series of laboratory trials, found that luggage and seat pitch had a notable impact on the overall boarding speed. Schultz (2018b) showed that a slight reduction of hand luggage per passenger can significantly increase the boarding speed. Kierzkowski and Kisiel (2017) noted that the way passengers stow their luggage and the bin's load can delay the boarding process. The studies of Coppens et al. (2018) confirmed that luggage stowing is a major factor impacting the boarding speed and passenger experience. Salari et al. (2019) achieved a reduction in the boarding time through a mixed integer programming model that allocates seats to passengers based on the amount of their hand luggage. Vendel et al. (2019) developed a system to improve the process of stowing hand luggage in the overhead bins, and analyzed its effect. Milne et al. (2019) developed a simulation platform to investigate the impact of the amount of hand-luggage on the boarding time.====Some studies considered the companionship factor of passengers who opt to board and sit together, as in the cases of family and friends. Budesca et al. (2014) pointed to the impracticality of most boarding strategies and to the need to account for the companionship factor among passengers. Zeineddine (2017) proposed a boarding strategy that takes into account the companionship needs of passengers, along with their seat positions and potential interference, to derive an optimal boarding sequence of passengers. Tang et al. (2019) emphasized that related passengers moving in groups towards their seats improve the boarding efficiency, especially under the assumption that the last passenger in the group handles the luggage. Wittmann (2019) relied on a simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal boarding pattern on a given flight, taking into account the need of companions to board together. Milne et al. (2020) proposed a mixed integer programming method that splits and assigns passengers to two apron buses for boarding a two-door aircraft, considering groups of passengers travelling together.====The aircraft layout and seat load play an important factor in the overall boarding time. Schultz et al. (2008) found a linear relationship between seat load factor and aircraft boarding time in aircrafts with one or two doors, under different boarding strategies. Frette and Hemmer (2012) and Bernstein (2012) reported a power law relationship between the aircraft boarding time and the number of passengers to board. Some other studies focused on modifying the seat layout in the cabin to improve the boarding time, as reported by Chung (2012), Schultz (2017), and Schmidt (2017). Schultz and Schmidt (2018) introduced the innovative concept of Side-Slip and foldable seats, to provide extra moving space in the aisle and consequently expedite the boarding process.====Few papers focused on analyzing the impact of passengers' non-compliance with boarding rules and procedures. Ferrari and Nagel (2005) investigated the robustness of some boarding strategies under different rates of non-compliance with the boarding guidelines. They found that the by-block boarding approaches yield better boarding time when passengers do not comply with the rules. Not boarding according to the designated block order brings the by-block strategy closer to a random boarding strategy, which has a relatively better performance. On the other hand, the performance of by-seat strategies suffers with higher rates of non-complying passengers, since the underlying order in these strategies is key to achieve better performance than random boarding. Schultz et al. (2008) measured the sensitivity of boarding time with respect to passengers' compliance with the boarding rules. They noted that the outside-in boarding strategy is highly sensitive to the unorderly arrival of passengers, where the time decreased by 45 s for every 10% increase in the rate of complying passengers. The opposite trend was observed with back-to-front strategies; in this case, the boarding time increased with the decrease in passenger compliance due to induced randomness. Later, Schultz (2017) considered the passenger conformance to the boarding rules, when studying the impact of Side-Slip and foldable seats on aircraft boarding. In another work, Schultz and Reitmann (2018) factored passengers' non-compliance in their proposed stochastic approach to aircraft boarding. Skorupski and Wierzbińska, 2015 discussed effective time duration for awaiting a late passenger's arrival before closing the cabin doors, taking into account cost factors, passenger satisfaction, and operational convenience.====Most of the work on passengers' non-compliance with boarding rules measured boarding time's sensitivity to passengers' non-compliance rate, but without investigating possible remedial actions. This study proposes a remedial action to mitigate the negative impact of such non-compliance on the overall boarding time. It also analyzes performance under different boarding strategies, that are categorized based on the level of randomness and companion friendliness.====After a problem definition section, the paper discusses the proposed model, simulation parameters and boarding strategies. It dedicates a section to describe and analyze the performance results. At the end, a conclusion summarizes the general observations and recommendations for future work.",Reducing the effect of passengers’ non-compliance with aircraft boarding rules,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000247,11 February 2021,2021,Research Article,220.0

Comparisons of air transport with high-speed train systems show that switching from aircraft to high-speed trains will significantly reduce the journey's energy consumption and environmental impacts (Givoni, 2007; Adler et al., 2010; Ha et al., 2011). Although the air transport industry has a less absolute impact on the environment (Dobruszkes, 2011), depending on increasing demand, the externalities generated from airports and aircraft engines such as noise and pollutants and their effect on the environment is expected to grow significantly in the near future (Yu et al., 2008; Martini et al., 2013a, Martini et al., 2013b). Indeed, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO, 2019) estimates that air transport emissions will approximately triple by 2050 worldwide.====Eurasian countries represent roughly 60% of global air passenger and freight traffic and produce a significant portion of global aviation's greenhouse emissions. According to the European Aviation Environmental Report, CO==== and NO==== emissions of all flights over Europe increased by 95% and 124%, respectively, from 1990 to 2016. These emissions are expected to increase by 15.8% and 43%, respectively, by 2040 (EEA, 2019). With their increasing share in global aviation, Asian countries also significantly affect greenhouse emissions. It is estimated that China alone is responsible for 13% of the CO==== emissions of global aviation. With the contribution of Japan, India, South Korea, and other North Asian and Pacific countries, this rate increases even more (ICCT, 2019).====Airports are an essential part of commercial aviation and are extremely energy-intensive (Baxter et al., 2018). Previous studies on sustainable airport operations focused mainly on the effects of terminal building and design on energy consumption (Kaszewski and Sheate, 2004; Kılkış, 2014; Akyüz et al., 2017). However, managerial studies on energy consumption and environmental impacts at airports are very limited. These studies tend to focus on energy or environmental aspects by barely linking both sides of these questions. On the business and management side, some papers have pointed out the relationship between airport congestion and emission and have demonstrated that reducing congestion with air traffic management technologies may lead to less fuel consumption and less environmental impacts (Ryerson et al., 2011; Simic and Babic, 2015). Some benchmarking studies compared the relative efficiencies of a set of airports considering their environmental impacts. Two pioneering papers published by Yu (2004) and Yu et al. (2008) have drawn attention to the negative impacts of aircraft noise for people living around the airport and assessed the relative efficiencies of Taiwan airports. In addition to aircraft noise, Martini et al., 2013a, Martini et al., 2013b and Scotti et al., (2014) considered emissions generated from aircraft engines during the landing takeoff (LTO) cycles and measured Italian airport efficiencies. However, these studies only focused on the environmental aspect and did not scrutinize the dilemma between energy consumption in airports and its environmental impacts. To address this issue, in this paper we proposed a two-stage network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model that keeps the emissions under control while minimizing fuel consumption of Eurasian airports by considering fuel consumption as an intermediate and pollutant emissions as undesirable outputs.====Airport operations in Eurasia are extremely heterogeneous both in spatial and temporal terms, not only dramatically evolving over the years in Asia since Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in China (Yang et al., 2008), but also the European regional differences among different countries and economic activity either boosts or imposes limits on the local evolution of airport operations in Eurasia (Pavlyuk, 2016). As long as the evolution of airport operations in Eurasian countries can be thought of as often being a disruptive process over the past decades mainly driven by local specifics such as regulatory landmarks (Reinhold et al., 2010), the analysis of time series and statistical models tend to be worthless in light of such historical vagueness==== (Liu, 2007).====Spatial and temporal heterogeneity has a significant impact on the airport industry not only in economic and operational terms, but also in sustainability efforts. Lynes and Andrachuk (2008) found strong impacts of industrial and cultural values behind the sustainability efforts of an international airline company and concluded that the environmental motivations of air transport systems cannot be isolated from these contextual factors. Kumar et al. (2020) emphasized the decisive roles of regulatory pressure and strict policies of governments on the implementation of green initiatives at the airports, which may differentiate the commitment of airports operating under strict government policies with sustainability initiatives from airports that do not feel this same pressure. While Kyriacou et al. (2019) demonstrated the relationship between government quality and the transport efficiency, Kılıç et al. (2019) found a strong positive effect of governance structure and quality on the sustainability efforts of the aviation industry where companies regulated by transparent governments would be more likely to engage in voluntary environmental initiatives. Authors also claimed that the economic development stage of a country impacts the green initiatives of aviation companies since sustainability issues become powerful tools to gain legitimacy in public opinion in developed societies.====This being the case, it is deemed necessary to study these evolutionary dynamics through the entropy concept (Guan et al., 2019), which can assess different heterogeneity levels as regards the evolution of airport operations over time across different countries in Asia and Europe. In this research, and differently from previous ones, Shannon's entropy (Shannon, 1948) is the cornerstone for the fuzzy inference==== on different perspectives (optimistic and pessimistic) of the spatial and temporal evolution of major airport operations in Eurasia.====As seen, airport efficiency measurement is a key research area surrounded by epistemic uncertainty with respect to the dual formed not only by the geographic and temporal scope of the analysis, but also by the method chosen to measure performance. In a broader sense, epistemic uncertainty reflects the lack of prior knowledge on how airport productivity could be impacted by contextual conditions scattered through time and space. For many practical purposes, epistemic uncertainty is inherent to delimitating the object-method pair under study and manifests itself regardless of the literature gap identified, the scale used to measure variables, the variable (input/output) selection, and the reproducibility conditions that are intrinsic to some extent to the airport industry. For instance, there is no questioning that the proper identification of the literature gap is relevant for advancing the body of knowledge in airport efficiency, especially with respect to DEA-based models where a plethora of different alternatives are designed to treat specific aspects of a productive network in different countries. However, research gaps and input/output measurement scales do not by themselves mitigate epistemic uncertainty in airport operations, but only assure under the aspects of internal validity in light of the current body of knowledge and scale validity that the proper analytical models were developed to adequately handle the specific nature of what is being measured.====Hence, as regards this paper, epistemic uncertainty can be conceptualized as the scientific uncertainty in the process of modelling airport productive structures in distinct geographic locations over the course of time. Despite limited data and knowledge, the joint use of information theory and soft computing offers methodological tools to mitigate epistemic uncertainty while increasing research validity and reproducibility: i) sensitivity analysis not only by running alternative models, but also by using different parameters into the proposed models; and ii) using information entropy principles for improving decision-making as regards whether or not a given model is contributing to reduce epistemic uncertainty. Information entropy is the cornerstone of information theory providing a constructive criterion for setting up distributions of computed scores on the basis of partial knowledge while enabling a type of inference based on the heterogeneity or dispersion of the scores where no extra biases or uncalled assumptions can enter into the analysis.====Therefore, this paper adds to the current body of literature by exploring the sustainability drivers of major Eurasian airport operations using a novel double-frontier two-stage fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) productive structure. Shannon's entropy is used here to capture airport operations heterogeneity and as a fuzzy inference cornerstone to discriminate optimistic and pessimistic efficiency views in the ambit of a double frontier. In the first stage called physical infrastructure efficiency, the runway length and terminal area are converted into fuel burn and required in the second stage, namely flight consolidation efficiency considering freight and passenger aircraft movements. Undesirable pollutants, however, such as CO====, CO, HC, and NOx are the by-products of this airport operation and should be minimized for the sake of environmental efficiency by maximizing the movement of goods and passengers while keeping pollutant emissions under control and minimizing fuel burn.====To this end, annual data from 2000 to 2018 from 23 major Eurasian airports are used to understand the evolution dynamics of airport operations regarding sustainable physical infrastructure and flight consolidation efficient operations. Differently from previous studies where sustainable airport efficiency is analyzed under traditional parametric and non-parametric efficiency models (Yu, 2004; Yu et al., 2008; Martini et al., 2013a, Martini et al., 2013b), this paper proposes an innovative Fuzzy Double-Frontier Network DEA (FDFNDEA) model to relate the sustainable airport operation drivers in major Eurasian countries to its inherent physical infrastructure/flight consolidation efficiency and sustainability trade-off in light of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Another distinctive feature of this paper is that major contextual variables are subsequently taken into account for explaining this trade-off using bootstrapped Cauchy regressions, which are adequate to handle ratio-dependent variables such as Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) and its embedded catch-up and frontier shift effects.====Conclusions found here indicate that the productive factors of airport operations across Eurasia are subject to high heterogeneity where the spatial heterogeneity is much more decisive on airport operations than temporal heterogeneity. A low vagueness was also detected in terminal and freight compared to runway and passengers, respectively, which prioritized them in expansion strategies in Eurasia. Lastly, although many previous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of private participation, this paper proves its significant impact on technological progression. The paper's layout is the following: Section 2 presents the backgrounds of the major Eurasian airport operations, section 3 details the literature review on undesirable outputs and efficiency drivers of airport operations, and section 4 focuses the methodology.

Cascading failure models from previous research are not adequate for airport networks, as flow is not continuous, and load has to be redistributed among close airports, rather than previously existing connections. With these constraints in mind, we have defined an algorithm to simulate the management of cascading failures in airport networks. We use the algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of several selection rules of alternative departure and arrival airports to affected flights to reduce the impact of the cascading failure. We have applied the algorithm to the Oceanic Airport Network to assess the impact of several incidents. Results show that selection rules of arriving airports have significant impact in reducing the effect of incidents affecting central airports.","The air transport industry has been growing until becoming an essential part of the everyday life in today's economy. Airline industry deregulation and liberalization has lead to a continuous growth of air transport (Wang et al., 2016; Burghouwt and de Wit, 2015; Goetz and Vowles, 2009). Air transport is generally considered safer and faster than other means of transport (Chambers, 2012), particularly to connect isolated rural areas and islands with urbanized areas, or to connect mutually distant locations such as cities in different continents (Rocha, 2017). Air transport has been shaped by historic, politic, geographic and economic factors (Guimerà et al., 2005), and is the result of the aggregation of routing decisions of airlines, that try to serve the air transport demand in the context of a competitive industry. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has been an important drawback for this trajectory of sustained growth. Beyond short-term effects like travel ban and border closures, the pandemic has brought some significant menaces for the airline industry in the future years. Some of these threats are the extensive use of teleworking by companies providing the demand of business travelers, the implementation of health screening controls that can make air travel less attractive for leisure passengers, and the likely lack of governmental support for full-service airlines (Suau-Sanchez et al., 2020).====An air transport network can be represented as an airport network, where nodes represent airports or cities and edges direct connections between nodes. This representation can be completed assigning weights to edges, usually representing intensity of connections (e.g. weekly frequency of flights). Following the pioneering study of Guimerà and Amaral (2004) for the global airport network, the topology of several regional airport networks has been examined by (Bagler, 2008) (India) (Guida and Maria, 2007), (Italy) (Wang et al., 2011), (China) (Hossain et al., 2013), (Australia) and (Tsiotas and Polyzos, 2015) (Greece), among others. All of these studies conclude, with minor differences between them, that air transport networks have the small-world property (a small average path length together with a high average clustering coefficient) and a truncated scale-free degree distribution (Amaral et al., 2000). In airport networks well-connected nodes have high values of node degree while central nodes have high values of betweenness, therefore degree and betweenness are measures of local and global centrality, respectively (Guimerà et al., 2005). found that for the world airport network the better-connected nodes are not necessarily the most central, resulting in anomalous values of centrality.====Air transport can be particularly affected by airport closure. This event can be triggered for environmental causes, accidents, security alerts, strikes or terrorist attacks, producing high costs for the airline industry (Lordan et al., 2014). One example of closure of airports by environmental causes is the ash plume from Iceland's Eyjafallajökull volcano. This event led to the progressive closure of large sectors of European airspace over a period of seven days, causing over 100,000 flights to be canceled (Wilkinson et al., 2011; Brooker, 2010). The effect of the closure of a particular airport depends of its role in the air transport network, i.e., the system shaped by airports and the flights that connect them.====The analysis of the impact of airport closure on a transport network is an example of operational resilience analysis (Ganin et al., 2016), which focuses in analyzing the evolution of a critical functionality for a class of adverse events. Two critical functionality measures have drawn researcher's attention: delays and loss of connectivity. Using passenger demand data, Voltes-Dorta et al. (2017a) analyze the vulnerability of the European air transport network from the perspective of passenger delays. They simulate the disruption of each of the 25 busiest airports and reallocating affected passengers in minimum delay itineraries. In Voltes-Dorta et al. (2017b) the same authors perform a case study analysis of the reallocation of passengers of the Palma de Mallorca airport. Cardillo et al. (2013) use schedules supply data to examine the passenger re-scheduling in a multi-layered airport network. The apparition of delays in an airport can trigger delays in other airports in the network on downstream flights. Du et al. (2018) analyze the delay propagation network using Granger causality analysis, and Zanin (2015) examine delay networks for a multi-layered model of the European airport network. From the connectivity loss perspective, the impact of airport closure can be analyzed through static robustness analysis, i.e., the study of the effect of the disconnection of a subset of nodes on network connectivity, usually measured as the size of the largest connected component. Chi and Cai (2004) performed a robustness analysis for the US airport network, and Lordan et al. (2014) detected the critical nodes of the world airport network using several node selection criteria. Both studies concluded that airport networks are robust to errors (isolation of nodes chosen at random), but not to attacks (isolation of important or central nodes). This behavior is typical of scale free networks (Albert et al., 2000). Static robustness analysis does not consider the dynamic effects that can occur after a network disruption. A small initial disruption can trigger secondary failures to other network components, leading to a cascading failure effect (Motter and Lai, 2002). This phenomenon is a significant threat to some networked systems, like the power grid (Kinney et al., 2005; Wang and Rong, 2011) or the Internet (Wang et al., 2014). Similar effects have been reported in some incidents in the air transport system, like the Eyjafallajökull volcano incident mentioned above. The first aim of this study is to create a model of cascading failures in airport transport networks. This model assesses the immediate impact of an incident involving the closure of a set of airports, evaluating the flights that have to be modified or canceled, and the airports that must be closed due to overload, until the incident ends and normal operations can be resumed. This model has to take into account the specificity of airport networks, specially when defining capacity and load of network components, and rules of flow redistribution compatible with air transport operations. Our second aim is to use the model to evaluate the effectiveness of several selection rules of alternative departure and arrival airports to reduce the impact of the incident. This approach extends the operational resilience analysis framework to the cascading effects of airport closure. If this analysis is performed beforehand, air navigation service providers (ANSPs) can define act more effectively when unanticipated events occur. In the case of anticipated events, such as meteorological hazards, the application of the algorithm to the specific situation can give a more precise guidance to mitigate impact event.",Cascading failures in airport networks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000090,10 February 2021,2021,Research Article,222.0

By definition, home base is the airport where aircrew flying duties start and end. Thus, it is the location around which airline workers typically settle and conduct their daily lives.==== Establishing a domicile in the vicinity of the home base airport is generally imposed as a contractual obligation by the employing airline. While this has remained unchanged from the beginning of scheduled commercial aviation, ‘home base’ as a legal concept has changed over time. Until the 1990s, this notion was exclusively reserved for safety-related purposes (i.e., to ensure that adequate rest periods could be attained by crew members). Following the liberalisation of the European aviation market, and subsequent opening of crew bases in multiple states by transnational low-cost operators, the term ‘home base’ became increasingly important in employment-related matters. In particular, the last two decades have seen an increase in its role in determining which employment regulations are applicable to airline personnel.

The analysis investigates these effects in an event study and through the lens of the merger's expected impact on the affected companies' wealth. In contrast to post-merger studies based on limited and oftentimes proprietary data not publicly available, having this information is timelier and more useful to policy makers evaluating a proposed merger's effect. The global air passenger market significantly contributes to the global economy. Annual growth in air passenger traffic was 8.1% in 2017, with an estimated 4 billion passengers, which is expected to reach 7.8 billion by 2027 and support an estimated 380 million jobs. 1, 2==== Further, defined by those travelling to, from, and within the country, China's aviation market in 2022 will replace the US as the world's largest aviation market.==== In 2018, China ranked 2nd behind the US with 4.9 billion available seats. China Eastern in 2017 ranked 8th in 110.8 million passengers served and ranked 8th in 2018 in passenger kilometers flown. Moreover, in 2017 Shanghai's Pudong International Airport ranked 10th based on aircraft movements (Airport Council International, 2017).====A focus in the economics literature has been the continuing effects of transportation deregulation in the US, initiated in the late 1970s and affecting all intercity transport modes. Economic deregulation of US airlines had significant impacts on virtually all aspects of the domestic and international airline markets (Morrison and Winston 1995). Similarly, significant deregulation in China's aviation market in the mid-1990s spawned a series of competitive responses, including the China Eastern – Shanghai Airlines (CE-SA) merger (Wang et al., 2016). The economic significance of China's growing presence in the global aviation market highlights the importance of gaining deeper insights on the economic effects of China's aviation deregulation and specifically on the competitive effects that the CE-SA merger had on domestic and international airline markets and on airline relationships with hub airports.====Our event methodology approach exploits the fact that, at the time of the merger announcement, domestic or foreign stock markets listed major domestic and international airlines that the merger directly or indirectly affected. Further, railways are potential substitutes for airlines. At the time of the merger, Shanghai Stock Exchange also listed Guangshen Railway, with passenger transport as its major business and which operates several railway lines in southern China, including routes from Guangzhou to Shanghai. Further, we exploit the unique setting in China where, beginning in 1998, the Shanghai Stock Exchange listed Shanghai Airport, followed by Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Xiamen airports.====Our event study analysis has two important findings. First, we show that two of the merged firm's rivals, Air China and Guangshen Railways, experience significantly positive abnormal returns, consistent with theory that an increase in the merged firm's market power leads to higher fares inducing some travelers to substitute to lower-fare alternatives. We also present evidence that international competitors of the merged firm experience significantly negative abnormal returns, consistent with predictions from theory that an increase in a merged firm's efficiency, in international markets in this study, generates a competitive advantage for the firm. Prior to the merger, Shanghai Airlines internationalized its route structure, and this enabled the new China Eastern to have an expanded scope of operations and international presence without large development costs. We find that increased market power and efficiency gain are both important profit drivers after the merger.====Second, and unique to this study, we find that there are significantly positive abnormal returns for Shanghai Airport, the hub of China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines but not a hub for other airlines. Our evidence suggests that the merger enabled hub airports to extract a part of the gain from the merged airline. In other words, the merger does not substantially increase the countervailing power of China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines against its hub airport.==== Our empirical results are consistent with various robustness checks. The results of the event study are robust to the use of different estimation periods. The results are also robust to alternative samples, including relevant airlines, railway and airports listed abroad.====Complementing the event study approach, we employ analyst forecasts as an additional source of information on how the capital market reacts to the merger. Consistent with the event study results, China Eastern and Air China have higher consensus predicted stock prices after the merger announcement. Finally, in addition to examining capital market reactions, we analyze long-run operating performance after the merger. China Eastern (which absorbed Shanghai Airlines as a brand) shows the largest performance gains in terms of size and productivity compared to other industry players. This finding is consistent with efficiency improvements also driving the merger. Our long-run results are consistent with our short-run event analyses, which suggests that an event study of an announced merger can provide policy makers with indications of the likely longer-term effects.====Section 2 provides the background information.

With concerns on global warming, policy makers have begun to take measures to decrease CO2 emissions (Anger and Köhler, 2010; Zheng et al., 2019), for example, the “offsetting scheme” of CORSIA and the “cap and trade” scheme of the aviation in EU ETS. Specifically, ICAO (2016) indicates that in order to control emissions of international aviation activities, member states of ICAO may voluntarily participate CORSIA between 2021 and 2026, while all member states are mandatory to participate in CORSIA between 2027 and 2035. Under these existing emissions reduction schemes, airlines may need to purchase emissions units through different ways, which is equivalent to emissions charges from airlines’ perspective, and thus implies a higher operational cost for airlines (Forsyth, 2008; Brueckner and Zhang, 2010). In fact, numerous studies have discussed the effect of airline network change on emissions (see, among others, Morrell and Lu, 2007; Steven and Merklein, 2013; Ryerson and Kim, 2014; Evans, 2014). Nevertheless, up to date, studies on how airlines respond to emissions charges by changing networks are still limited.====In the literature about the influence on airline network structure of emissions charges, Derigs and Illing (2013) focus on the air cargo network reconfiguration. Hsu and Eie (2013) and Ko et al. (2017) do not consider the hub-spoke (HS) network. In addition, Brueckner and Zhang (2010) study the network choices of duopoly airlines between the fully-connected (FC) and HS networks in the presence of emissions charges. In reality, besides FC and HS, the mixed (MX) network is also a prevalent network structure (Dunn, 2008; Fageda and Flores-Fillol, 2012; Lin, 2012; Wang and Wang, 2019a, b). Under MX network, passengers in some markets can choose either direct or connecting flights, implying that MX network is essentially a combination of FC and HS networks. Due to different departure times (Goedeking, 2010) and brand loyalty (Brueckner and Girvin, 2008; Lin, 2015), direct and connecting air services are imperfectly substitutable, indicating the horizontal product differentiation (Lin, 2012). Therefore, MX network has advantages over FC and HS networks as it can employ the horizontal differentiation to a larger extent and raise the passengers’ willingness-to-pay. Consequently, the aim of this work is to contribute to the stream of relevant studies by focusing on passenger traffic and considering simultaneously FC, HS and MX networks under the monopoly airline market.====In our model, besides the horizontal product differentiation, the difference in service quality, such as travel time, indicates the vertical product differentiation. Following Brueckner and Zhang (2010), the airline's cost includes the fixed cost and fuel cost of operating flights. In particular, the fuel cost per flight is the product of fuel price, aircraft fuel efficiency, aircraft seating capacity, the load factor of a flight, and hours per flight, and we use the rising fuel price to indicate the impact on the airline of charges in terms of emissions.====We find that, first, there exists an upper bound of fuel price such that the airline's optimal network does not exist if the fuel price exceeds this upper bound, which implies that if the rising fuel price is too high, airlines may not be able to obtain positive profits under any network structure. This result is consistent with the findings that fuels account for a large share of airlines' operating costs and thus are vital for the profitability of airlines (Caves et al., 1984; Oum and Yu, 1998; Zou and Hansen, 2012; Scotti and Volta, 2017; Hu et al., 2018; IATA, 2019). However, if the increased fuel price is sufficiently high but not too high, airlines may always choose the FC network.====Second, the impact on airline network of charges in terms of emissions depends crucially on some relevant parameters. For example, as fuel price rises, if the disutility of additional travel time of connecting flights is low, the optimal airline network may be MX and FC networks sequentially when the marginal benefit of the reduction of schedule delays is low, while the optimal network may be HS, MX and FC networks sequentially when the marginal benefit of the reduction of schedule delays is high. Such patterns closely correlate with the trade-off between fuel costs and horizontal product differentiation.====Third, a discontinuity appears in the network choice of social planner, which mainly comes from the flexibility of MX in terms of allocating passengers between direct and connecting flights. For example, as fuel price rises, if the disutility of additional travel time of connecting flights is low, the optimal network of social planner may be HS, MX, FC, MX, and FC networks sequentially. Finally, because of the excess incentive to exploit the horizontal product differentiation, the airline may inefficiently choose MX networks.====In the literature on the relationship between emissions charges and airline network, the contribution of this work is the inclusion of MX network. Previous studies focus on the route choice within FC or the network configuration choice between FC and HS (see Brueckner and Zhang, 2010; Hsu and Eie, 2013; Ko et al., 2017). Nonetheless, this paper uses a framework allowing the allocation of traffic between direct and connecting flights, that is, a major characteristic of MX network (see Lin, 2012; Wang and Wang, 2019a, b), and investigates how airline emissions charges affect airline network choice by considering all FC, HS and MX networks.====The rest of this work is as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 discusses the optimal network configuration of the airline. Section 4 derives the optimal network of social planner and studies the difference between the airline and social planner in terms of network choice.

Chinese airline market has suffered very poor on-time performance (OTP) in recent years. It is, however, unclear whether delay propagation prevails as one major source for such problem. This study first aims to empirically quantify delay propagation in the Chinese airline market. Specifically, we shed light on heterogenous levels of delay propagations across different airports and airlines. Then, the distinct delay propagation patterns in China are also discussed and compared with other developed airline markets (e.g., the US and Europe). Our estimation is based on OTP data for over 12 million Chinese flights covering the 2015–2017 period. Specifically, it is found that 10 min arrival delay of pre-segment flight within 1 hr before the departure lead to an average of 7.49 mins delay propagation for subsequent departure flight. Arrival delay of earlier pre-segments (1–2 and 2–3 hr before the departure) leads to much less delay propagation, due to longer ground buffer. Chinese airlines arrange longer ground and flight buffer than that of the US airlines to prevent the delay propagation from accumulating along the subsequent flights in a day. Thus, unlike the US market, delay propagation is not the major reason for poor OTP in China. In addition, delay propagation is less prevailing at the Chinese hub airport. This is because China has relied on point-to-point network, which does not require sophisticated schedule coordination. And the local passengers at these Chinese hub airports have higher time value such that the Chinese airlines also try to improve OTP at these hub airports to better serve these lucrative but time-sensitive local passengers. Unlike the European LCCs, Spring Airlines, the largest low-cost carrier (LCC) in China, outperforms major full-service carriers (FSCs) in controlling delay propagation. This finding may also apply to other Northeast Asian LCCs sharing common operational characteristics as Spring Airlines. Last, we find that airlines purposely tolerate moderate departure delays of up to 15 min, which is the threshold that defines delays, no matter whether the pre-segment flight arrives late or on-time. The relevant policy and managerial implications are also discussed.","Flight delay has become major challenge to global aviation industries. For example, data of the US Bureau of Transportation (BTS) indicates that, in 2012, 14.69% of the flights in the US domestic market were delayed. In 2019, this ratio increased to 20.8% (BTS, 2020). According to Ball et al. (2010), flight delay led to total cost as much as US$32.9 billion for the US economy in 2007. Such delay problem also prevails in emerging airline markets with sustained growth, in particular China. As the world second largest airline market, China has kept double-digit annual air traffic growth in the past two decades (CAAC, 2019). The flight delay is very serious in that much of growth has been concentrated to metropolitan areas and the airport capacities have not been installed accordingly (Zhang 2010; Wang et al., 2014b). In 2019, the flight on-time performance (OTP) rate was only 75%, with per flight delay being on average 29 min (CAAC, 2019). According to OAG (2019), OTP of Chinese airports and airlines rank very low among all surveyed markets.====Similar to other major markets, airport congestion is one major source of flight delay in China (IAR, 2018). The limited air space for civil aviation further hinders airlines to maintain OTP (Zhang and Chen, 2003). Some random factors, such as extreme weathers, technical failures, air traffic control can also contribute to (unexpected) flight delays. But airlines might still be able to control flight delay with effective operational and managerial measures. One way is to add “flight buffer” on the expected actual flying time. This can help absorb flight departure delay (Brueckner et al., 2019; Forbes et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2020). According to IAR (2018), Chinese airlines on average add 30.9 min flight buffer per flight in 2017. At congested hub airports (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou), average flight buffer can even exceed 40 min. It is of course not always economical to increase flight buffer as it also lowers aircraft utilization, increases airline operational cost, and wastes passenger's time.====Delay depends not only on the operation of one particular flight. If the inbound flight arrives late, its subsequent outbound flight is also likely to depart late. This is because the incoming aircraft or crews could be used in a next departure flight. This is called “propagated delay” in that it propagates from one flight to the other flight. Brueckner et al. (2019) suggest the late-arriving aircraft could be the major source of flight delays in US, outweighing other reasons like extreme weather, air traffic control etc. To partly mitigate delay propagation, the US airlines also tend to lengthen ground buffer time between two consecutive flights (Kafle and Zou, 2016; Brueckner et al., 2019; Forbes et al., 2019). Such ground buffer is defined as the time difference between the scheduled ground turnaround time and the aircraft's minimum feasible ground turnaround time.====Compared to the US and European market, the empirical studies on delay propagation in the Chinese market are quite scanty. First, it is unclear whether delay propagation is also prominent, thus contributing to poor OTP in China. According to Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC, 2019),==== 21% of delays in China can be attributed to airline reasons, including late-arriving aircraft, technical and coordination issues. This suggests delay propagation may be one important source for flight delay. But for better policy and managerial implications, it is necessary to quantify such delay propagation, through more rigorous statistical approaches. To mitigate delay propagation, the US and European carriers add ground and flight buffer. This would help improve OTP (saving passenger time cost) but increases airlines' operational cost due to lower aircraft utilization and rising crew payments (Jetzki, 2009; Brueckner, 2019; Forbes et al., 2019). Chinese airlines possess significant operating cost advantage, especially the very cheap labor cost, over their US and European counterparts (Wang et al., 2014a), and Chinese passengers might also have different value of time (Fu et al., 2020). As a result, Chinese airlines could adopt very different ground and flight buffer choices to deal with its delay propagation. Existing studies based on the US market also suggest that delay propagation can be more serious at major hub airports, while it is unclear if this finding holds in China. Unlike those developed airline markets, Chinese airlines have yet established hub-and-spoke system, still relying on point-to-point network structure (Wang et al., 2020). The hub airports mainly serve lucrative local traffic (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou), with the transfer traffic only accounting for less than 15% of these airports’ traffic (Wang et al., 2014b).==== The local passengers at these hub airports are wealthier and time-sensitive who require better flight OTP, pressuring airlines to mitigate potential delay propagation at these hub airports. Meanwhile, Chinese airline market is dominated by the “Big Three” airlines, namely Air China, China Southern and China Eastern Airlines, that have significant state ownership. Private airlines and low-cost carriers (LCCs) in China, however, are still at development stage (Wang et al., 2017b, 2018; Liu and Oum, 2018). LCCs have emphasized on quick turnaround and high aircraft utilization (i.e., shorter ground buffer) (Morrison, 2001; Fu et al., 2015). As observed by Jetzki (2009), without lengthy ground and flight buffer, European LCCs could suffer more serious delay propagation problem. Chinese LCCs also have higher aircraft utilization than full-service carriers (FSCs) (Fu et al., 2015). However, unlike the US and European LCCs that focus on secondary airports, Chinese LCCs are mainly based in Shanghai Pudong and Hongqiao airports, which are very congested. These distinct characteristics could result in different delay propagation patterns and buffer choices in China.====The objective of this study is first to quantify delay propagation in the Chinese airline market. With the empirical evidences, we answer whether delay propagation is substantial to cause poor OTP in the Chinese airline market. We also shed light on the differences in delay propagation among different types of Chinese airports and airlines. Then, such results can be benchmarked and compared with existing findings which are almost exclusively based on the US and European markets. That is, our study recognizes the distinct airline operational and market demand characteristics in China as mentioned in the above paragraphs. Specifically, we collect data on flight OTP for over 12 million Chinese domestic flights covering the 2015–2017 period. Regression analyses are conducted to measure the delay propagation, to be estimated as the effect of arrival delay in pre-segment flights on departure delay of the subsequent flights.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant literature. In Section 3, we propose the econometric models for the empirical investigation. Data source and summary statistics are also presented and discussed in that section. Section 4 collates estimation results and discusses policy and managerial implications.

Such literature, however, paid virtually no attention to the conditions under which LCCs lose their convenience compared to traditional airlines. The purpose of this study is to investigate the occurrence of LCCs sometimes offering higher fares than FSCs on competing flights. By using a dataset expressly collected for this purpose, we are able to quantify its frequency and suggest some possible explanations. These findings concur to cast some questions on the widely held preconception of vertical differentiation between LCCs' and FSCs’ offered services. Further research will be needed in order to understand the relative weight of the suggested factors.","Among a number of distinctive characteristics of the multifaceted business model of low-cost carriers (LCCs), which attracted the attention of scholars engaged in air transport economics since its inception more than four decades ago, the most noticeable characteristic was the particular pricing policy common to the majority of LCCs: the so called “dynamic pricing,” namely, the practice of continuously raising fares as the booking date approaches the date of flight.====This unprecedented tract of yield management within air transport industry naturally attracted the attention of a number of scholars engaged in air transport economics.==== Among other things, one of the outcomes of such studies has been an abundant empirical evidence that, ====, LCCs’ fares (per km) have been/are lower than full-service carriers (FSCs). Even in the more recent evolutions of both LCC and FSC business models, a progressive hybridization notwithstanding, this state of affairs does not seem to have changed.====Nevertheless, on some occasions, LCC fares tend to be higher than those of FSC. Both direct experience (i.e., when searching for good fares for our own trips) and casual observations in our databases suggested that occurrences of higher LCC fares on the same (or on a parallel) route were more frequent than commonly expected. An example is presented in Fig. 1.====As reported below, in 9.8% of observations in our database involving price comparisons, LCCs were more expensive than FSCs, and in almost 33% of the 36,653 analyzed flight pairs, this phenomenon has occurred at least once. Furthermore, such a percentage systematically increases when approaching the flight date (Fig. 2).====As far as we know, while the possibility of finding an FSC fare lower than LCC for the same city pair has already been noticed, albeit incidentally, by Piga and Bachis (2007),==== it does not seem to have caught further attention in subsequent literature (perhaps even because of the difficulty of collecting a suitable database). Indeed, the existing literature mainly focuses on the reactions of FSCs when an LCC enters a route and less on price matching. At the same time, as far as product features are concerned, it is usually maintained that differences between LCCs and FSCs have been decreasing over time, while the higher quality of FSCs’ services compared with those of LCCs is nonetheless somewhat taken for granted.====Our analysis aims, therefore, at carrying out a study focused on the understanding of this phenomenon, identifying its extent, and highlighting when and under what conditions it is encountered.====In particular, by coupling flights operated by LCCs and FSCs that can be considered as substitutes (i.e., flights connecting the same cities on the same day and time slot), we aim to investigate, through the use of a multivariate logistic regression, the dependence of the “price reversal” phenomenon on some variables, and suggest some possible explanations, thereby opening up, among many, some questions on the widely held preconception of vertical differentiation between LCCs' and FSCs’ offered services.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a short description of previous literature regarding LCCs' and FSCs' pricing policies, and their dependence on competitive pressure. In Section 3, we describe the dataset and the methods applied for coupling low-cost and traditional airlines’ prices, following which in Section 4, we introduce the econometric methodology and describe the different variables applied. In Section 5, we discuss the results obtained from our estimations.

We automatize the computation of free-flow road travel times, as well as the public transit times (by bus, subway, light-rail, tram and railway), from grid cells to infrastructure elements, by using a scalable routing framework. The Chinese air transportation network and HSR network are used as case studies to elaborate and evaluate the efficiency of our proposed framework. We find that the HSR network for China is much better accessible for the population than airports. Furthermore, grid cells with a high population density are much better connected to the Chinese transportation networks than other grid cells. Our methodology is generic in that it can be applied on an even larger scale (whole planet) and with different points of interest. Our work can help provide decision support for airport competition, privatization, and regulation, and for policy makers in infrastructure investment, in particular potential market and the location of new infrastructure elements.","China, as the country with the largest population approximately 1.4 billion in the world, its travel demand is surging in recent years. In 2019, the total number of air passengers in China reached 0.68 billion and the average growth rate for the air passengers maintains more than 10% in the last decade. During the same period, the busiest high-speed railway line, the Beijing and Shanghai line, starting operation in June 2011, has transported more than one billion passengers. With such tremendous travel demand, the Chinese government is investing huge amount of money on its infrastructure system, especially for airports and HSRs. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced that at least 50 new commercial airports will be built until 2030. According to the “Mid-and-Long Term Railway Network Plan”, the HSR network will be further expanded to the “eight vertical and eight horizontal” structure and the total length would reach more than 38,000 km by 2030. China's total HSR investment from 2017 to 2025 is estimated to be about 7.2 trillion RMB (1.04 trillion USD), which is about 10% of Chinese GDP in 2016 (Wang et al., 2017).====However, despite the massive infrastructure expansions, land-side accessibility to these two infrastructures from the passenger's perspective has yet been clearly analyzed and compared. Further, studies (e.g. (Wang et al., 2017), have shown that more coordination between the HSR stations and airports is needed for a balanced and efficient intercity transport system in China. In this paper we evaluate, and compare, their land-side accessibility (Pasha and Hickman, 2016; Ellis et al., 1974), i.e., how easy it is for potential air/rail passengers to travel to airports/HSR stations.==== We measure the accessibility by travel time between a given population grid cell (latent passengers) and the nearest airport/HSR station, by accounting for both motorized vehicles and public transport. Given the fierce competition between airports and HSRs in China (e.g. (Liu et al., 2019),), the ground transportation-induced accessibility is an important decision criterion for the populations; although other factors contribute, such as price, service frequency, level of comfort, schedules/time of day, etc. On the service supply side, increasing the accessibility of an airport, for instance, can be one of the possible strategic actions for airports to improve their market position, since travel time is of vital importance for the choice of an airport by air travellers (Harvey, 1986; Pels et al., 2003; Usami et al., 2017; Wandelt et al., 2019). Similar results have been found for other transportation modes (Ureña et al., 2009; Garmendia et al., 2012; Monzón et al., 2013; Brinckerhoff, 2010). Finally, for the planning and investment point of view, knowledge of comparative accessibility would locate the best infrastructure investment opportunities for a region as well as for the country as a whole.====Our second objective in this paper is to measure and visualize the size of an airport's/HSR station's catchment area, i.e., how many potential passengers can reach an airport or a high-speed railway (HSR) station within a certain travel time radius.==== The catchment area of (for example) an airport is traditionally determined either by distance (e.g., within a 150-km radius of the airport), or simply by a legally defined locale (city/county) in which the airport is situated. By setting a certain travel time radius, our measure is able to account for how easy for passengers to reach an airport by using available transport systems which depends, in addition to distance, on the availability as well as the quality of land-side transportation systems. Note that the concept of catchment area is a combination of the population size and accessibility (the required travel time) of HSR stations or airports, given the existing transport infrastructure networks, including road networks and public transit systems. As such, we further conduct a correlation analysis between accessibility and population size.====The Chinese air transportation network and HSR network are used as case studies to elaborate and evaluate the efficiency of our proposed framework. In total, there are 214 (commercial) airports and 742 HSR stations in China and these access points to the transportation networks are not evenly distributed throughout the country. The Chinese transportation infrastructure is of particular interest, given the incredible growth in demand and service in the last decades (Su et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2018).====Based on our experiments, we find that the HSR network for China is much better accessible for the population than airports: For instance, 50% of the population can reach a HSR station within one hour of traveling, while only 33% of the population can reach an airport. Moreover, we find that grid cells with a high population density are much better connected to the Chinese transportation networks than other gird cells, which may indicate the success of initial, aggressive dissemination of both transportation modes. It may also suggest much work left to do in order to connect the hinterlands. We would like to emphasize that the proposed method allows us to convert the raw data into a “product”: the estimation of an airport's/HSR station's catchment area, and our methodology is generic in that it can be applied on an even larger scale (e.g., planet) and with different points of interest (city centers, working places, etc.).====Furthermore, while our accessibility measure is rooted in traditional computation of isochrones for an infrastructure element, we have four major differences from traditional research in this area:====Note that most existing studies use administrative unit-specific population data often at county/city/province levels, simply because of data shortage or data unavailability. In this study, we construct a grid-cell based accessibility estimation framework and it is the finest resolution with population data available (i.e., one by one square kilometer). These datasets are available worldwide, which means that other researchers should exploit this data for their own analysis. Regarding the computational complexity, the complexity (and the amount of required computational resources) can be nicely controlled by adapting the resolution of the grid cells: The larger a grid cell is, the less computational resources are required. At the same time, the level of accuracy is reduced. This leads to a zoom-in/out function for various model sizes, depending on the region under study.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, we review the state of the art on accessibility estimation for airports or HSR stations in Section 2. The methodology underlying our accessibility framework is presented and discussed in Section 3. The accessibility of Chinese airports and HSR stations is evaluated in Section 4. Section 5 summarizes our key findings and discusses directions for future work.","Comparative accessibility of Chinese airports and high-speed railway stations: A high-resolution, yet scalable framework based on open data",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305937,30 January 2021,2021,Research Article,228.0

The quantitative results showed the ==== safety culture performance and its influence on the safety performance outcome constructs. This study is expected to contribute towards the development of safety culture evaluation for this industry and becomes a stakeholder's indicator to improve safety and health standards.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicted that the number of passengers in 2018 would increase two fold to 8.2 billion by 2037. For the next 20 years, the Asia-Pacific region will be the leading and largest growing air passenger traffic. The industry stakeholders will significantly measure up their performance to adapt to the growing number of passengers and cargo volumes. IATA has previously reported that an increasing number of ground events disrupting air operation simultaneously was the main reason for airlines to incur annual losses of nearly USD 4 billion in line with the expansion of the ground handling industry. It does not only cause economic consequences but also pose health and safety threats. The constant rise in terrestrial accidents at Malaysian aerodromes over the last couple of years has caused great concern among the aviation stakeholders. In our correspondence with Malaysia Airports Holding Berhad (MAHB), 2019 had shown an increase of 28% ground accident occurrences at Malaysia's airports and stolports over the last 5 years. These occurrences were attributed by accidents and near misses in the airside related to aircraft and non-related aircraft activities involving vehicles, facilities, and ground equipments. With broad-based airport innovations and traffic growth, the complexity of ground handling operations has considerably increased, corresponding to greater numbers and aircraft sizes. Consequently, in this dynamic environment, it is difficult to preserve and enhance ground operational safety, and to track the activities requires a thorough evaluation process on safety culture.",Holistic view of safety culture in aircraft ground handling: Integrating qualitative and quantitative methods with data triangulation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000028,25 January 2021,2021,Research Article,229.0

Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to explore the roles of organizational trust, organizational identification, and organizational commitment in safety operation behavior (SOB) for one hundred forty-three airline pilots. Correlation analysis indicated that organizational trust, organizational identification, organizational commitment, and SOB were significantly correlated with each other. Bootstrap analysis showed that airline pilots' organizational identification and organizational commitment mediated the relationship between their organizational trust and SOB in aviation. Implications for research and instructions for how to improve airline pilots’ SOB in aviation are discussed.","As aviation safety is the “lifeline” of civil aviation enterprises and even the entire aviation industry of a country, the safety operation behavior (SOB) of pilots is almost equal to their job performance. At the very beginning of aircraft manufacturing, technical limitations and the economic level led to a low automation level and strenuous manipulation of aircraft. Consequently, air accidents or flight incidents at that time were caused by mechanical reasons in most cases. However, as both aircraft manufacturing technology and automation level have been enormously improved in modern times, the percentage of air accidents caused by human factors related to pilots has increased dramatically. The relevant data indicate that since the beginning of the 21st century, the probability of air accidents due to aircraft equipment failure has dropped from 80% to 3% (Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, 1998; Wiegmann and Shappell, 2001; Li and You, 2014), which signifies that the stability of aircraft has been radically enhanced. Nevertheless, the percentage of flight accidents caused by human factors has increased in recent years. According to Wiegmann and Shappell’s (2001) statistics, the percentage of flight accidents caused by pilot human error, such as misoperation, was approximately 70% from 1990 to 2000. Krey (2007) reported that 79% of the fatal accidents that occurred in the United States in 2006 were attributed to pilot error. In addition, in Taiwan, the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) reported that personnel were cited as a major cause or factor in 71.9% of accidents between 2001 and 2010 (Chen and Chen, 2014). In addition, Kharoufah et al. (2018) reviewed the causation of human factors in commercial air transport accidents and incidents in the world from 2000 to 2016. They found that human factors contribute to approximately 75% of aircraft accidents and incidents. In addition to the above research, numerous international aviation organizations have summarized and analyzed the characteristics of aviation accidents in their official documents. For example, the Aviation Safety Report of International Air Transport Association (IATA, 2018) suggests that human factors are still the weakest link in aviation safety management. Aircraft Owners & Pilots Association (AOPA, 2017)'s statistics show that only in 2016, the US recorded more than 750 fixed-wing accidents, causing more than 200 deaths, and nearly 3/4 of the accidents were caused by pilot-made errors. Similarly, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA, 2020)'s latest statistics suggest that 465 aviation accidents were caused by human errors in the field of non-commercial aviation in the past 5 years; 144 aviation accidents were caused by the same reasons in the field of commercial air transportation from 2015 to 2019, and the proportion of such human-error-induced accidents to all the accidents in the field saw a significant upward trend in the past 3 years. In summary, human error has become one of the most important factors influencing aviation safety in the last twenty years. Therefore, an increasing number of researchers propose that reducing pilot error in aircraft piloting is the most effective means to improve modern aviation safety.====It is noteworthy that a great number of studies have proven that most of the reasons why pilot error takes place are psychologically related (Hunter, 2001; Wiegmann and Taneja, 2003; Ji et al., 2011; You et al., 2013). Without any doubt, the existing studies still have many deficiencies in various aspects despite those on revealing pilot error mechanisms having made a breakthrough. In other words, the mechanism of pilot error should be further investigated in the future because previous studies were mainly performed from the perspective of individual psychology in most cases to explore the impacts of individuals’ personality traits on the SOB of pilots.====For instance, personality factors such as trait mindfulness, risk perception (Ji et al., 2018a, Ji et al., 2018b), emotional intelligence, coping style (Guo et al., 2017), perfectionism, achievement motivation (Ji et al., 2017), self-efficacy (Li et al., 2018), locus of control (You et al., 2013), risk tolerance and hazardous attitude (Ji et al., 2011) were proven to have a large influence on pilot SOB in some previous studies. However, there is a problem; these studies inadequately considered the psychological factors at the organizational layer or considered less the psychological interaction between an individual and the organization by studying the pilots independently from the organization. However, we believe that any employee is always with an organization; thus, it seems to us that the factors at the organizational psychological layer are of equal importance for the SOB of pilots. Therefore, this study mainly aimed to start from the organizational psychological layer to delve into whether organizational trust, organizational identification and organizational commitment influence the pilots’ SOB and what the influence mechanism between them is.",Organizational trust and safety operation behavior in airline pilots: The mediating effects of organizational identification and organizational commitment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721000016,23 January 2021,2021,Research Article,230.0

Thus, bringing SAF for GHG reduction reasons into the day-to-day business more effective market injection mechanisms are needed. In this context, direct and indirect effects of a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction obligation in the EU and in Germany are analysed, considering an obligation level of 2% in 2023 increasing stepwise to 10% by 2030 following the goals derived from transport-related RED II targets. For such GHG reduction obligations referred to the entire EU 27 and the entire German aviation fuel uplifts, obligation induced SAF demands possibly exceed future SAF production quantities by a factor of about two without effective capacity expansion exceeding the published expansion plans. The considered SAF options lead to an aviation fuel price increases of 5–45% referring to a conventional aviation fuel price of 550 €/t. Aviation related EU ETS and German aviation tax revenues are mostly insufficient to significantly cover obligation-induced SAF costs or additional fuel costs. Fostering a broad spectrum of SAF technologies will thus require obligation related sub-mechanisms, due to (significantly) different SAF compliance costs. Thereby, sub-mandates represent the most effective approach. In terms of obligation avoidance measures, tankering – in contrast to three re-routing options considered – is likely to be economically feasible for airlines and requires appropriate countermeasures.","The international aviation industry intends a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 50% by 2050 relative to a 2005 baseline [IATA 2015, 2 f.]. Within the EU net-zero global warming emissions shall be reached by 2050. Thereby, a GHG emission reduction of at least 90% compared to 1990 is aimed for within the transport sector including that aviation's environmental footprint is to be intensively reduced [EC 2020d; 2019b; 2019a; 2020c]. To achieve these aviation-related climate goals target-oriented and cost-effective measures are urgently needed. Yet, various technical, operational, and infrastructural measures for the reduction of aircraft fuel consumption and GHG emissions have been implemented to a considerable extend in recent decades. Further (marginal) improvements often demand increasingly high expenditures. At the same time technological basic innovations (i.e. hydrogen and/or electric aircraft) still require considerable development efforts in the coming decades to reach commercial viability [McKinsey and Company 2020; Thomson et al., 2020b; DLR und BDLI 2020].====Therefore, in the short and medium term an effective market injection of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is seen as a key measure to reduce aviation-related GHG emissions on a large-scale. Nevertheless, their large-scale commercial use is still significantly lagging behind.====The technical readiness of SAF has been repeatedly demonstrated. Yet, SAF supply/production capacities and market shares are still strongly limited in Europe and worldwide. High SAF production costs (thus high fuel prices) compared to (cheap) conventional (fossil energy based) aviation fuels combined with lacking target-oriented regulatory frameworks to foster SAF technologies and supply form major market barriers [Bullerdiek und Kaltschmitt 2020; E4tech, 2019a; EC 2020d; CST 2020, 6; ICAO 2019a, 172; WEF 2020, 9; EASA 2019b, 13; Prussi et al., 2019; EC, 2020e, 9 ff.; Ghatala 2020; IEA 2018, 126]. Stimulating large-scale SAF market shares and the expansion of supply capacities can basically be realised on a legal basis by various supply and demand side mechanisms (e.g. tax incentives, loan guarantees, feed-in tariffs, auctioning mechanisms, funding mechanisms, fuel/CO==== taxation, fuel multipliers, opt-in mechanisms, fuel prioritization models, fuel or emission-related landing fees) [Bullerdiek und Kaltschmitt 2020; Ghatala 2020; EC 2020d]. Besides these mechanisms, in past years in particular, obligation schemes have been and still are widely discussed in politics and scientific papers [Kalimo et al., 2019; Larsson et al., 2019; Transport & Environment, 2018; CST 2020; WEF 2020; Biofuels International 2020]. Moreover, they are already implemented at various national levels in Europe to enforce the use of SAF [CST 2020, 9]. Also in the context of “ReFuelEU Aviation” initiative – a key element of the EU Green Deal and the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy to boost SAF usage in the EU – various aviation industry stakeholders address a quota obligation scheme as a key policy measure [EC 2020d; 2020b, 2020f]. However, so far scientific and political considerations often solely base on qualitatively assessments or limited quantitative analyses.====Against this background, a quota obligation scheme is analysed as a market injection instrument for various SAF options, considering their different techno-economic and environmental characteristics. This is based on a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction obligation as this obligation type explicitly promotes fuels with low GHG mitigation costs [Regeringskansliet 2019, 31; E4tech, 2019b, 41]. Furthermore, this allows for a more comprehensive analysis of environmental-economic correlations of a quota obligation scheme for SAF. Direct and indirect effects are analysed for four different scopes in the EU 27 and in Germany. The “sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demand”, “total SAF costs”, “additional SAF costs” as well as the “average fuel price and ticket price increases” are considered as direct effects assessment parameters. Regarding indirect effects, the design of a non-fulfilment penalty, the supply of SAF demands and obligation cross-financing options, as well as further sub-mechanisms and adverse avoidance measures are analysed.====After outlining SAF market barriers and quota obligation schemes in the first part of this paper, the analysis concepts as well as obligation-related and external framework conditions and parameters are defined. Subsequently, the analysis concepts are examined according to the selected direct and indirect effects.",A GHG reduction obligation for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in the EU and in Germany,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972100003X,23 January 2021,2021,Research Article,231.0

Following that widespread usage of digital technologies has become inevitable. This has started the digital transformation process. Now, the senior executives of the companies emphasize that the digital transformation is the tsunami of the twenty-first century. This transformation has radically changed the business models, decision-making processes, strategic plans, products, and services of the companies. Emerging technologies have become indispensable parts of the daily lives of the people (Linnes and Metcalf, 2017, Huawei, 2017). Especially with the expansion of the internet network and access, people are online and mobile all the time. (Klimmt et al., 2018; Hootsuite, 2020). Nowadays, averagely, more than 6.5 hours in a day are spent online by internet users. The average time spent on the internet through mobile devices is almost 3.5 hours a day. The total world population has increased by 1.1% in the last year, and following that, the number of mobile device users, which was 5.19 billion in 2019, increased by 124 million people in 2020. This situation has penetrated internet usage. The number of internet users worldwide increased by 7%, from 59% to 66%. Moreover, the existence of social media platforms has also affected the rates of internet and mobile device usage. In the last year, the percentage of active social media users has increased from 49% to 58%. Furthermore, 300 million people around the world have become online in the last year for the first time. Confidence, connection, and convenience have become focal points. Feedbacks from public social media have become critical for the discovery of brand and acquisition of customers. The creation of a seamless experience based on automation and connectivity with the human is seen as a key. Social marketing, and performance, customer experience, omnichannel integration and social media engagement have become the new remarkable areas. (Hootsuite, 2020). The expectations and behavior patterns of the people have changed (Büyüközkan et al., 2020c, World Economic Forum and Accenture, 2016, Wright et al., 2017). Companies have had to meet these expectations by analyzing these models of change to compete and ensure their profitability and sustainability. As a result, companies have found themselves in a digital ecosystem.====Digital transformation is a transformation process that provides benefits to companies in many ways. However, such an ecosystem is highly competitive. In addition to those who have started digital transformation processes, companies have to struggle with digitally born firms. If the requirements are not satisfied, the disruptive power of digital transformation will be inevitable. Hence, companies should focus on their digital competency levels.====Many industrial areas have been influenced by digital transformation, including the aviation and airline industry (Büyüközkan et al., 2020a,c). However, the aviation industry provides huge returns to both global employment and the global economy. Furthermore, the demand for air transportation is growing day by day and the ecosystem has become highly competitive. Digital transformation has already influenced the airline companies. Passengers are looking for the best pre-flight, flight, and after-flight experiences using mobile applications, digital platforms, online booking, baggage tracking and delivery, customized services, in-flight entertainment, and self-service implementations with low cost.====The low-cost airline (LCA) market has great potential and also risks in terms of airline companies when the effects of digital transformation are considered. Hence, LCA companies should evaluate their digital competencies to be sustainable and to provide profit in a highly competitive digital ecosystem. Therefore, it is aimed to introduce and propose a new digital competency evaluation (DCE) model to evaluate the digital competencies of LCA companies. Experts’ opinions and a conducted literature survey are the basis of the proposed model and its criteria. To validate the proposed model, a case study concerning the LCAs in Turkey is conducted by considering their rates of preferences and transformation perspectives.====The evaluation of digital competency and the selection of the most competent airline company is a decision-making process. Many different criteria exist in decision-making. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is a powerful tool that is widely used to evaluate problems that often contain many conflicting criteria. Hence, MCDM methods are utilized in the study. There are several MCDM methods developed and used to solve and model different problems in various areas in the literature. Besides, there are many scientific studies using MCDM methods in the airline industry (Ishizaka and Nemery, 2013; Dožić, 2019; Fu, 2019; Gupta, 2018; Havle and Kılıç, 2019). Furthermore, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 1980) is the most utilized MCDM method among others (Mardani et al., 2015). The AHP method is easy to implement, allows consistency checks, and supports group decision-making. It provides systematic hierarchical modeling of complex problems (Narasimhan, 1983). The AHP method allows determining the importance degree of the criteria. However, real-life problems are often complicated. They are characterized by various criteria that are conflicting and incommensurable. Hence, there may not be a solution that meets all criteria at the same time. Hence, a compromise solution can help decision-makers (DMs) achieve a final decision for a problem, including some contradictory criteria (Opricovic and Tzeng, 2004). VIšeKriterijumska Optimizacija i Kompromisno Rešenje (in Serbian) (VIKOR) method allows to rank the alternatives and to select one of them (Opricovic, 1998). Not only the VIKOR method but also different MCDM techniques such as Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) (Hwang and Yoon, 1981) can be used for ranking and choosing alternatives. However, the TOPSIS method assigns a solution based on distances from negative and positive ideal solutions, but the relativity of these distances is not taken into consideration. At this point, a feasible solution is obtained by the compromise solution. It is closest to the ideal solution and based on mutual concessions. (Opricovic and Tzeng, 2004). The statements given above demonstrate the usability and advantages of AHP and VIKOR methods. While the AHP method deals with decision-making problems linearly, the VIKOR method allows DMs to take their assessments at the initial level. Therefore, AHP and VIKOR methods are integrated. This integrated methodology helps to deal with complicated decision-making problems effortlessly and efficiently. The integrated approach provides a logical and sensible solution. Accordingly, an integrated AHP-VIKOR methodology is employed in this study.====Decision-making processes are based on human perception. It creates uncertainty. Hence, classical MCDM methods were extended to a fuzzy environment to eliminate complexity and uncertainty. Different studies are utilizing fuzzy MCDM methods successfully in the literature (Kahraman et al., 2015). However, in some cases, data may be insufficient or inaccurate. Decision-making processes may include uncertainty, vagueness, and intuition. In such a case, classical fuzzy sets may be inadequate. Therefore, fuzzy MCDM methods are expanded to an intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) environment. Interval Valued IF (IVIF) sets provide to model and solve complex problems. Besides, they have an advantage of the indication of membership and non-membership of an element in a set by considering positivity or negativity-based differentiation in an interval. Hence, the integrated AHP-VIKOR methodology is expanded to the IVIF environment. The IVIF AHP method is used to calculate the weights of the evaluation criteria and the most appropriate alternative is selected among candidates through the IVIF VIKOR method.====The airline industry has witnessed many changes due to the different philosophies of low-cost business models adopted by the LCAs. LCAs are in a highly competitive and dynamic ecosystem. Furthermore, the effects of digital transformation push the LCAs for new steps for their sustainability and competitiveness in a digital airline ecosystem. This aspect is not covered in the scientific literature. Hence, the contribution of the study can be summarized as follows: This study focuses on LCAs with a digital transformation perspective and proposes a new evaluation model for digital competency. An integrated IVIF MCDM methodology is adapted to the proposed model, and a case study concerning the LCAs in Turkey is carried out for the first time to the best of our knowledge. The steps of the study are given in Fig. 1.====The study is constructed based on the following sections: Digital transformation in the air transportation is summarized in Section 2.

The category of dynamic capabilities embraces those organizational competencies which enable organizations to modify their routines, operational capabilities and resources with the aiming of adapting to business environmental changes. The research results, conducted on a full sample of Polish regional airports, suggest that there is a difference among regional airports in perceiving the role of particular dynamic capabilities in achieving economic effectiveness. Some dynamic capabilities are more important for small regional airports in comparison with their larger rivals. Research conducted on similar groups suggests that heterogeneity in shaping dynamic capabilities exists within organizations operating in the same sector.","Nowadays airports need to attract both passengers and airlines by ‘strategically acting on marketing and route development and trying to differentiate their offer’ (Bergantino et al., 2020, p. 622). Therefore, they are perceived as business entities, which require competences and skills to operate effectively (Graham, 2008).====The issue of an airport's effectiveness has attracted research attention through the changes in perceiving an airport's goals, not only in terms of being a public utility which provides society with safe and unrestricted flows of cargos and passengers, but also as a business entity which should be oriented towards achieving financial goals as well (Francis et al., 2003; Graham, 2008). Recent changes in the air transport sector (such as privatization, airline deregulation and liberalization) have changed the rules of competition among airports (Pagliari and Graham, 2019).====In comparison to the existing literature reports on airports’ performance and operational efficiency (Humphreys et al., 2002; Liebert and Niemeier, 2013; Manuel et al., 2012), the analysis of aeronautical and non-aeronautical costs and revenues, as well as the issue of privatization and ownership (Oum et al., 2006), this research is focused on a resource base reconfiguration as a source of airport economic effectiveness.====The Dynamic Capabilities View attempts to explain the reason why some organizations perform better than others, and suggests that even small differences in resource reconfiguration can lead to highly different company performances (Zott, 2003). As Eisenhardt and Martin (2000, p. 1116) argue – dynamic capabilities ‘consist of many well-known processes such as alliancing, product development, and strategic decision making’.====The Dynamic Capabilities View is ‘one of the most influential theoretical lenses in contemporary management scholarship’ (Schilke et al., 2018, p. 390). The Dynamic Capabilities View is a theoretical framework which reflects a specific category of capabilities that enable companies to change their resource base. In short, a dynamic capability is defined as ‘the capacity of an organization to purposefully create, extend and modify its resource base’ (Helfat et al., 2007, p. 4). Teece (2012), the pioneer of the Dynamic Capabilities View, highlights the fact that thanks to dynamic capabilities organizations are able to timely respond in a timely fashion to dynamically changing business environments.====The term ‘dynamic’ refers to the changing nature of business environment. Therefore it attracts attention to those activities, which are involved in proper response of an organization to its business environmental changes. In turn, the term of ‘capability’ draws attention to the perspective of activities taken at a company level (Teece and Pisano, 1994). Thereby, the Dynamic Capabilities View is useful theoretical framework for study regional airports for two reasons. Firstly, it focuses on internal, managerial perspective of an airport, as an organization. Although the organizational capabilities is highly discussed area of research, the literature research carried out allows to conclude that the cognitive gap concerning the organizational capabilities of regional airports has not been filled so far. Therefore the application of the Dynamic Capabilities View allows to concentrate on strictly managerial perspective of airport activities. Secondly, the Dynamic Capabilities View enables to answer the question, how an organization adopts to environmental changes.====The rationale for this study was to deliver knowledge about significance of dynamic capabilities for a company economic effectiveness. This problem was examined in the context of Polish regional airports. The aim of the research was to recognize dynamic capabilities that are crucial for airport economic effectiveness. The main goal of the research embraced three operationalized research questions:====This research is a part of a wider project on the dynamic capabilities of Polish enterprises. The survey was conducted in the period November 2016 to July 2018, on a full sample of 13 active (carrying commercial passengers) Polish regional airports during the years 2012–2015. The research is qualitative in nature and brings an overview on the significance of particular dynamic capabilities for achieving economic effectiveness.====A deeper analysis leads to the conclusion that each airport has its own characteristics. Although there are some external circumstances that are determining airport activity on a macro level (political, socio-cultural and legal factors) as well as geographical level (e.g. regarding region-attractiveness: tourist and business activity), this paper pays attention to the internal perspective, concentrating on it aims at identifying dynamic capabilities which support the economic effectiveness of airports.====The next Section briefly discusses the characteristics of the Dynamic Capabilities View with a focus on airport economic effectiveness.

This study examines potential recovery pathways from the global aviation ==== following the severe negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using archival and secondary data mainly from Flightradar24, ====, IATA and EUROCONTROL, the study found that the pandemic inflicted a heavy toll on global aviation, which resulted in ratings downgrades, liquidation and bankruptcy of several airlines and airports due to severe cash burn instigated by travel restrictions. Although the industry is opening up, the recovery process seems much slower than anticipated, which could see more jobs and airlines failing in the absence of relevant support. The study recommends that as the sector opens up, it does so in a responsible manner, which puts measures that protect travellers, reduce costs, increase efficiency, and ensure a quality customer experience anchored on employees' health and customer safety.

The sector remains a crucial part of the tourism economy providing rapid transportation of tourists, cargo such as medical supplies, food and other essential goods globally. Regardless of the sector's global critical role in facilitating human and goods movement (====; ====), evidence shows that the sector is sensitive to stresses such as economic downturns, natural disasters, political instability and pandemics (====).==== and also ==== reveal that several events in history had demonstrated the vulnerability of the global aviation sector to various catastrophes. Amongst these have been the sector's vulnerability to diseases and pandemics such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the avian influenza H5N1 in 2006, and the swine influenza H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Other crises that challenged the aviation industry include the oil crisis in 1973, the Iran-Iraq War in the early 80s, the Gulf Crisis in the early 90s, the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the financial crisis of 1998 and 1999 (====).====, questions the ability and capacity of the tourism and travel sector to deal with biosecurity threats that seem to be frequently recurring. The travel and tourism sector is also viewed as a significant transmission pathway, which aids the spread of various diseases across the world through the mobility of infected persons. ====Studies of previous diseases outbreaks by ==== and ==== point to the possibility of onboard disease transmission of certain diseases. Given this understanding, the aviation industry had to adopt health and safety protocols such as the disinfection of aircraft to destroy onboard vectors such as mosquitoes. However, in some instances, vectors were found to be humans, making the situation complex (====; ====, the aviation industry's rapid growth paved the way for the rapid proliferation and spreading of diseases through people movement, which placed a demand on the sector to take appropriate protective measures to protect the global economy.==== highlights that after the September 11th bombing (9/11), many airlines in the USA sought state intervention to remain afloat. The 9/11 attacks led to a plunge in passenger numbers, which saw the state passing a bill in congress to offer aviation loans and guarantees to ensure industry viability (====). ==== note that shocks from fuel prices can also severely impact airlines' profitability. The aviation industry has moved forward in terms of having advanced computer models capable of simulating sophisticated patterns of epidemics and pandemics spreading through the airline transportation network across airports worldwide (====; ====). However, regardless of these advances, one issue that becomes clear is that the industry has generally not mastered the development of adequate financial resilience to deal with the ever-recurring costs imposed by disasters and other internal and external shocks.====There was general anticipation that the global aviation sector would see another year of robust growth in 2020 across the sector globally. This was against the backdrop of industry-wide years of successive growth in cargo, passenger numbers and revenue in recent past. With this background, many airlines have been investing and buying new aircraft, which propelled aircraft manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing, thereby leading to a considerable backlog in the delivery of new aircraft. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported in January 2020, before the outbreak of the coronavirus that the aviation sector expected an increase of revenue passenger kilometres' (RPKs) growth of 4.1% and a freight tonne-kilometres’ (FTKs) increase of 2.0% in 2020 (====). However, IATA revised projections for the industry several times as it became clear that COVID-19 would severely impact aviation industry growth.====; ====; ====). Therefore, given the unprecedented and fickle nature of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, there is a need to continuously track and monitor the pandemic's impact on various sectors of the economy to provide insights necessary for policy and practice. Understanding how the pandemic is evolving is crucial as industries across the world prepare to work during a pandemic or the ‘new normal.’ Such understanding allows for the adoption of measures that ensure the operational sustainability of various economic sectors. There is a general view that the pandemic has made various global economies reset, promoting a fresh start on a new sustainable, and more resilient trajectory (====; ====; ====) and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (====).====With the preceding, this paper sets out to document how the global aviation industry and its value chain are recovering from the impact of COVID-19.

This paper presents two UDPP-DCB models, built on the UDPP principle, using the Selective Flight Protection (SFP) approach to minimize the total delay cost. AUs are enabled to adapt their operations in a more cost-efficient way in the presence of capacity constraints in airspace, optimizing their flights to keep the priorities track. Then, ATFM integrates the AUs’ decision to reassign the time slots and the preferred rerouting trajectories. Results suggest that the delay cost for AUs can be largely reduced through applying the UDPP-DCB models proposed in this paper, while allowing rerouting proves effective in reducing the system delay cost.","The rapid growth of air traffic demand in Europe, in the presence of a limited amount of airspace capacity, imposes a growing demand-capacity imbalance, raising challenges for the air traffic flow management (ATFM). In 2019, 9.9% of total flights that year, growing by 0.3% compared to 2018, were delayed by en-route ATFM regulations in Europe. Among all the delay causes of en-route ATFM delays, demand-capacity imbalance occupied 43.9% (EUROCONTROL, 2020a) in the year of 2019. It is estimated that irregular operations may cost Airspace Users (AUs) 2–3% loss of annual revenue (Castro et al., 2014).====To mitigate this impact, ATFM attempts to prevent such demand-capacity imbalance by adjusting the traffic flow to match the capacity. The assignment of delay is considered to manage the flow, and different types of measures could be taken to absorb the assigned delays, including ground holding, airborne holding and linear holding. As a safer and more cost-effective strategy, ground holding was first formulated with the objective of minimizing congestion cost in 1987 by Odoni (1987). For the environment, some studies were carried out in a deterministic context (Gilbo, 1997; Pilugurtha and Nambisan, 2001) and others focused on a stochastic context (Rikfin, 1998; Mukherjee and Hansen, 2007). Regarding to the allocation algorithm, first planned, first served (FPFS) is the most common one in ATFM. FPFS not only is fair for AUs as it preserves the original sequence of flights (Vossen and Ball, 2006), but it is also well accepted by ATFM (Castelli et al., 2011). Lulli and Odoni proposed a flow management involving combinations of ground and airborne holding based on the nature of European ATFM solution (Lulli and Odoni, 2007). Recently, linear holding was proposed to be included in ATFM initiatives (Xu et al., 2016, Xu et al., 2017), which is also performed airborne but with no extra fuel cost, as it is done by means of a cost-based speed control rather than extending the flight path.====Rerouting is another often-used strategy apart from delay assignment. Bertsimas and Patterson presented an IP model to solve the problem of determining how to reroute aircraft under changing weather conditions (Bertsimas and Patterson, 2000). Aiming at realistic applications, a new IP model for large-scale instances of the ATFM problem, which further considers the combination of adjustment of aircraft cruising speed and rerouting strategy was proposed by Bertsimas et al. (2011). Agustı'n et al. (Agustı'n, 2012a, b) proposed two 0–1 models allowing flight cancelation and rerouting to address both deterministic and stochastic scenarios. A sequence model for rerouting under the sector-based airspace configuration was proposed in (Diao and Chen, 2018), and the heuristic algorithm was used to handle large-scale instances.====Under current operations, ATFM and AUs are independent to some extent, especially in the strategic phase. Most communications and coordination occur under the tactical phase. In the early development of ATFM initiatives, AUs usually have little influence in the decision making. To enable AUs to play more proactive role, both SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) in Europe and NextGen (Next Generation Air Transportation System) in the United States have launched ATFM programs using more collaborative decision mechanisms (CDM). In 1990s, the concept of CDM was first used in GDPs (Ground Delay Programs) by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), and the slot can be traded among AUs, aiming at improving the efficiency of utilizing airspace (Hoffman et al., 1999). A wider range of applicability of CDM (e.g., ground delay program enhancements, collaborative routing, performance monitoring) was presented in (Ball et al., 2001; Raffard et al., 2005), in which significant decision-making responsibilities were given to AUs. In Collaborative Trajectory Optimization Program (CTOP), AUs can submit alternative trajectory and also indicate the priority for specific route (Murca, 2018). With the increasing involvement of AUs in ATFM decisions, market-based mechanisms have been explored at strategic level in several SESAR projects. For instance, SATURN project aimed at testing realistic ways to use market-based demand management mechanisms to redistribute air traffic in the European airspace, which proved to be effective in reducing congestion and saving the AUs operation costs (Bolić et al., 2014, 2017). ADAPT project developed some linked models to find the best distribution of flights by exploiting past routes information, and the early flight information sharing was allowed in this project (Bolić et al., 2018). COCTA project effectively improved the coordination of capacity suppliers and AUs by strengthening the role of the network manager, including performing trajectory pricing, offering route menus and providing other flexible products to AUs (Ivanov et al., 2019).====SESAR introduced the User Driven Prioritisation Process (UDPP) to give additional flexibility to AUs by rearranging their flights according to their own business needs in 2015. Under the slot-swapping scheme, AUs can only perform limited swapping of ATFM slots with many rules and constraints. Enhanced ATFM Slot Swapping (ESS), which has already started its deployment in 2016, improves participation for AUs in slots assignment by making it possible for AUs to swap pre-allocated slots with allocated slots and carry out multiple swaps for a single flight (SESAR, 2015). In order to create more flexibility and equity for AUs during demand-capacity imbalance, two new concepts were proposed in UDPP step 2 based on Trajectory Based Operation (TBO) (SESAR, 2014), which include Fleet Delay Apportionment (FDA) and Selective Flight Protection (SFP). Although these two prioritisation mechanisms are expected to start from 2022 to 2025, they have been validated in earlier 2019 in some simulated flight operations environment (====).====Given the above-mentioned studies, we may notice two open questions. First, there have been not much discussions of how to well participate UDPP from AUs' points of view. Second, it is needed to reconsider the ATFM model in order to make the most use of the improved involvement of AUs in decision making. This paper mainly focuses on these two aspects. A so-called normal model and an enhanced model for AUs are proposed using SFP to minimize the cost of delay, followed by the establishment of two respective ATFM models to reassign all the slots based on the AUs’ decisions. The normal model only considers suspension strategy, and the enhanced model considers both suspension and rerouting.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the concept of UDPP in C-ATFM, a brief introduction of FDA and a formal definition of SFP. Section 3 explains delay cost structure of AU and builds a Normal UDPP-DCB model. An Enhanced UDPP-DCB model is then presented in Section 4, which rerouting and suspension are both taken into consideration. Then, two case studies are presented in Section 5, using realistic data of traffic crossing the French airspace. The discussion of the results and wider application of the models are proposed in Section 6.

In Europe, the rapid expansion of low-cost carrier Norwegian that entered the long-haul markets from several large metropolises (London, ====, ====, etc.) imposed a burden of challenges to full-service carriers (FSCs). However, Norwegian operates a large portion of its long-haul service from London Gatwick by offering flights mainly on high-density routes. Although Norwegian's capacity and market shares on these routes are still at a low level mainly due to the carrier's “puppy-dog” strategy, it seems that its effect on British Airways, the dominant carrier on these markets, cannot be ignored. The purpose of the research is to examine the extent to which the presence of Norwegian affects the prices charged by British Airways on three selected high-density transatlantic routes performed from London area. The model applies simultaneous equation systems to determine how the emergence of Norwegian affects the price and the passenger volume of British Airways, as a traditionally dominant carrier, at the city-pair markets. The findings are consistent with the well-established view held in the literature, that a LCC's presence at a specific market would generally affect the incumbents to reduce their prices. Indeed, British Airways announced the capacity expansion as a counter-strategy to mitigate the competitive pressure induced by Norwegian and its affordable service.","The competition between LCCs and FSCs has been focused exclusively on short to medium-haul markets for a long time (Franke, 2004; Dobruszkes, 2006; Alderighi et al., 2012). The launch of the new aircraft generation entwined with further liberalization of intercontinental air transport market are among the major reasons explaining recent attempts of many LCCs to expand their service into long-haul markets. Thus, the emergence of this new concept brought the paradigm change in the airline industry and its effect on competition becomes the particular interest among researchers. Although the existing academic literature is generally inclusive of long-haul low-cost business model sustainability (Francis et al., 2007; Morrell, 2008; Daft and Albers, 2012; De Poret et al., 2015), presence of several successful carriers, particularly in Europe and the U.S., brings a renewed enthusiasm that such a business model could prevail more in the near future.====For example, rapid fleet expansion of Norwegian Air Shuttle====and its entry into the transatlantic market from London area imposed a burden of challenge to well-established full-service carriers and forced them to behave competitively. Norwegian's long-haul strategy highly relies on dense routes into popular leisure markets that can easily be stimulated by fares lower than those offered by its FSC rivals. Among the well-established FSCs that operate the transatlantic market, British Airways is probably most severely affected by Norwegian's entry in the market due to its high market power on the majority of routes. Similar to short and medium-haul markets, the presence of LCCs in long-haul market is expected to impose a competitive pressure on FSCs to reduce their fares in order to retain the market shares.====This study aims to empirically examine the effect of Norwegian's presence on British Airways' fares on several transatlantic city-pair routes that Norwegian has entered recently. The paper is particularly focused on the role of British Airways' price and capacity adjustment as a mechanism to respond to Norwegian's entry. For this purpose, the paper employs simultaneous demand and price equations using the data for the period between 2010 and 2017. The paper differs from previous studies on the effect of LCCs on price competition in several aspects. First, to the best of our knowledge, the intense price competition in the transatlantic market between the incumbent carrier, British Airways and its new LCC competitor, Norwegian, has not been empirically examined yet. Similar to previous studies that examine a FSC's pricing behavior in response to LCC competition, this paper aims to explain the variation in the FSC's response to LCC competition over various city-pair routes. The study also provides an in-depth insight into Norwegian's route entry pattern into the segment of transatlantic market that connects the U.K. with the U.S. Among these introduced routes, the route that connects London to New York will be separately examined, since this route is featured as one of the busiest routes in the world with a great number of operating carriers and airport-pairs offered. For this route, the effect of “capacity extension” strategy employed by British Airways is empirically tested through modification of the HHI index.====The paper is organized as follows. After a brief introduction, Section 2 provides a literature review on the effect of LCC's entry on FSCs' behavior as well as the results of the studies that investigate the viability of long haul low cost (LHLCC) business model. Comprehensive overview of the transatlantic market and its structure with emphasis on Norwegian's network expansion in this lucrative market is given Section 3. Section 4 introduces an econometric model that aims to explain the effect of LCC competition on the dominant FSC's price and number of passengers on the transatlantic market and the estimation results of this model.

Our approach combines revenues (occupancy) and costs (oil prices) for 33 U.S. airline companies from 1990 to 2019. Using travel capacity utilization data from U.S. carriers at monthly frequency and exploiting fixed-effects regression models, we document a positive relation between occupancy and stock returns, which is attenuated by oil prices. The role of oil becomes larger with asymmetries: the effects of oil prices are higher when moving up than down. Airline stocks always respond by more than the overall stock market.","We examine in this article a sector of the U.S. economy (airlines) operating in the leisure, tourism, and transportation sector that uses oil as its major input. Using oil price returns as a measure of costs, these companies are subject to flows of revenue stream, in which of utmost importance are capacity utilization measures, such as occupancy of seats, number of passengers traveling, and so on. These flows of revenues can be steady in normal economic conditions or may fluctuate enormously during abrupt events, such as the terrorist attacks of 9/11 or the pandemic, such as COVID19. The same may happen to oil prices, which move downward quickly in the presence of unforeseen circumstances of the global supply or demand for oil.====In contrast to earlier papers for the airline industry, we take into account information directly from U.S. airlines (seat-occupancy), which is available at a monthly frequency, together with oil price returns to capture jet fuel (cost) fluctuations.==== We investigate the extent to which these two components are passed through to the market price of airline stocks, with stock returns of a representative sample of U.S. airline companies as the dependent variable. We allow in the empirical models for standard controls in the literature of stock returns, such as oil price volatility, yield spread, aggregate stock market, and Fama-French factors.====Our approach in this paper is based fundamentally on Sadorsky (2008) and Narayan and Sharma (2011), as well as more recent advances by Shaeri et al. (2016), Baur and Todorova (2018), and Killins (2020). While the first two papers combine firm-level data (sales or turnover), the latter three investigate oil price returns along with the aggregate stock market in a multi-factor approach to stock returns augmented by Fama-French factors. We implement this approach for monthly panel data of 33 airlines from 1990 to 2019, almost 30 years of data, with the following main results. The occupancy of seats is priced in stock returns of U.S. airlines, the effects of oil prices have higher effects when they move up than when they move down, and airline stocks respond by more to movements in the overall U.S. stock market.====This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we show that the capacity utilization (occupancy) of airline companies is an important factor for stock returns. This finding helps investors understand the visible attribute of the revenue side of airline companies before investing in these stocks. For example, knowledge of historical trends of capacity utilization can help investors decide how and whether to invest. Second, increases in oil prices enlarge the operating costs for airline companies, which outweigh the revenue from higher occupancy rates. The role of oil prices suggests that airline companies may consider operating as efficiently as possible. Third, this study shows the moderating effects of oil prices are more visible when they move up than down. Airline companies can therefore maintain financial slack to cope up with increased operational costs due to oil prices moving up when operating efficiency is not feasible. Fourth, this study documents the higher movement of airline stocks with respect to the overall market.====We organize this article as follows.

This phenomenon reached a different point with developments in the aviation industry. However, the price of the great benefits of aviation is high. This situation means governments attempted to identify different investments in aviation infrastructure. As a result, the Private Public Partnership (PPP) concept became useful in aviation infrastructure. The Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model has become widely popular with governments as a way of PPP. In this method, a concessionaire is responsible for the design, construction and operation of the investment for a predetermined amount of time. Through that time frame, all or a certain portion of the revenue belongs to the concessionaire. After that time expires, the investment will be transferred to total government ownership (Kashani, 2012).====Regarding cost, when airport investments are realized by PPP, it is inevitable that contract time will be long. In an airport investment, a major portion of the revenue will be traffic revenues and in the aviation environment, where epidemics, natural disasters, wars or even socio-politic events can affect the travel needs of people or change the cost of aviation, it is not hard to see the high risk margin of that investment. Particularly when considering operating for 10, 20 or more years, this risk becomes totally unpredictable. For that reason, governments need to take measures like revenue guarantees to encourage entrepreneurs to invest in their projects. Investors, on the other hand, design and operate airports not only to earn income out of the aviation side of the airport, but also from the land side too.====Companies running long term PPP projects like airports, which are vulnerable to uncertainties in the future, need to estimate their expected income in detail. Different methods can be used for the valuation of those projects. One of them is Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). DCF is a traditional valuation method that does not take the possible extraordinary scenarios and management reactions against them into consideration. On the other hand, the Real Option Valuation (ROV) method, which was conceived of later, lets the investor see a clearer picture of the future by considering uncertainties and possible courses of actions of the management (Janney and Dess, 2004).====As an option, real options differ from the financial options on the point of the assets it is dealing with. Real options deal with real assets, while financial options deal with financial assets (Myers, 1977). Real option analysis is also useful in more complicated situations like investments that may create a platform for subsequent investments. In these kinds of situations, investors would like to know how and when to make subsequent investments. Considering a second planned investment phase as a growth option, real options analysis can value a multi-stage investment too. The method used in this situation is called compound real options (Lin and Duan, 2013).====This article examines an airport project in Turkey which was planned to be built by PPP and the BOT model. The real names of the airport project and concessionaire company will not be stated in this paper. The concessionaire of the project, nicknamed ABC company, who won the government BOT project bid, planned to expand its investment after the construction of the airport and establish a flight academy, skydiving center and guesthouse at the airport. However, the company already completed its feasibility report before construction began, and the government cancelled the project. The purpose of this study is to value the project as a multi-stage growth strategy and to find the best time period to invest in expansion investments after airport construction is completed using the compound real option method. This valuation will analyze a real feasibility report obtained from the concessionaire company.====The method used in this paper was used previously to value a railroad infrastructure project by Adetunji and Owolabi (2016). This was also a PPP BOT project, which the concessionaire already decided to realize. In their paper, they valued both time-to-build and growth options of the railroad project.

While current Regulation 261 is criticised for being too consumer-friendly, the proposal takes the opposite stand. As it now stands, the proposal endangers passengers’ rights by increasing delay and cancellation lengths or by excluding delays at non-EU airports. The inclusion of tarmac delay could result in abuses from airlines. While bringing some clarity, the exhaustive list of extraordinary circumstances also creates new questions. The proposal also includes well-overdue changes such as the inclusion of missed connecting flights and a stronger role for National Enforcement Bodies (NEBs). Overall the proposal weakens passenger rights without real justifications.","Regulation 261 has always been a very controversial piece of legislation which suffers from significant non-compliance by airlines and ineffective enforcement at national level (Drake, 2020; Garben, 2016). However, from an airline and airline associations perspective, the Regulation is too burdensome and consumer-friendly, especially after its interpretation by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), resulting in a call for a revision since nearly day one. The need for revisions was also advocated by international organisations, such as IATA (IATA, 2017). The European Commission issued a proposal for reform in 2013, but the revision remained politically deadlocked, mainly due to a dispute between the UK and Spain over the application of the Regulation to Gibraltar (Drake, 2018). The UK's departure in January 2020 has unlocked the process, bringing forth the revision of Regulation 261 back on the agenda. The first step was taken in February 2020 with a revisit of the 2013 Commission proposal launched by the Croatian Presidency. (General Secretariat of the Council, 2020).====The central criticisms of Regulation 261 are its complexity, vague wording and weak decentralised enforcement regime, resulting in an increasing number of CJEU cases to clarify the current legislation (Drake, 2020) While the CJEU tried to best protect passengers' rights, its judgments created two main issues; first, broadly worded judgment requiring further clarifications and second, the discomfort of some national courts in applying such judgments (Garben, 2016). For instance, in Sturgeon====, one of the most criticised cases, the Court ruled that passengers were entitled to compensations for long delays, although the wording of the Regulation excluded such compensations (Balfour, 2010; Leffers, 2010; Garben, 2013a, Garben, 2013b; van Dam, 2011). This complexity also leaves some wiggle room for ‘rebellious national courts’ to divert from the CJEU's case law, which, in turn, maintains existing inconsistencies in the application of the law. These shortfalls, coupled with the non-compliance and ineffective enforcement, have also had an unexpected consequence: a drastic rise of Claims Management Companies (CMCs). Their proliferation is mainly due to the fact that the legislation is complex, inconsistently applied, and often misunderstood. The non-compliance and enforcement problems have been further illustrated with the COVID-19 outbreak requiring the Commission to set in and issue interpretative guidelines (European Commission, 2020a, European Commission, 2020b). As the Steer Report (2018) noted, “The low intelligibility of Regulation 261/2004 and the related jurisprudence contributes to its complexity, resulting in a lack of trust between passengers and airlines” (p. vii). Consequently, any revision of Regulation 261 should restore the trust between passengers and airlines while reducing the proliferation of claim farms.====While the current version of Regulation 261 has often been criticised for being too passengers-friendly, the proposal seems to take the opposite stand. It drastically shrinks passengers' rights by attacking one of the main areas of contention: the amount compensable. Indeed, the compensation framework has been criticised by airlines, airlines associations, and academics for being overly in favour of passengers (Colangelo and Zeno-Zencovich, 2019; Defossez, 2020). For instance, Andrew Kelly argued that “Regulating for compensation amounts as much as 10 times the paid fare is clearly unbalanced and unfair. It will, and has, put airlines out of business, close down connectivity routes, have a massive impact on regional economies, and most threatening of all, EU261 threatens safety. The future, unless EU261 is revised, will be a consolidated market controlled by a handful of big airlines, low fares, and competition will be gone, and the European project will be fractured irreparably as connectivity is lost” (ERA, 2019, p. 4). However, the findings of the European Court of Auditors' Report suggest quite the contrary. According to the Report, only around 1/3rd of passengers claim compensation (European Court of Auditors, 2018). It is estimated that more than half of the cases that should be compensated are discarded by airlines on the ground of ‘extraordinary circumstances (van Dam, 2011; Morris, 2017). According to the UK Civil Aviation Authority, three out of five claims, which were initially rejected by airlines, were later held to be legitimate (Calder, 2018). Even if one agrees that the Regulation overly favours passengers, airlines have found a way out by extensively relying on the ‘extraordinary circumstances’ defence (Defossez, 2019). In fact, it seems that airlines took the view that Article 5 (3), i.e., exclusion of obligation to compensate, is the rule, and Article 5 (1) (c), i.e., compensation, is the derogation. Consequently, the argument that Regulation 261 puts disproportionate costs on airlines does not take the reality into account, namely the difficulties for passengers to get compensated (Drake, 2020). Finally, if Regulation 261 had such a negative impact on low fare and competition, as claimed by Andrew Kelly, such would have been noticed by now.====Even though Regulation 261 failed to ensure legal certainty on both sides, the Regulation still tried to balance both needs. On the contrary, the proposed changes seem to overly favour airlines and exacerbate the existing mistrust towards them. This mistrust can be explained by the difficulties passengers face in enforcing their rights and obtain individual redress (Drake, 2018). Many claims are dropped due to the ‘imbalance’ between the amounts that could be received and the time required for such action. CMCs are, therefore, viewed by some as a game-changer while they are, in fact, only filling an enforcement gap. As Drake (2020) noted, “the effectiveness of the regime is unlikely to improve without legislative reform” (p. 230). However, the reforms proposed by the Croatian Presidency might not be the most suitable to improve the effectiveness of the regime, quite the contrary. In fact, the suggested changes go against the general trends of increasing passengers' rights, as exemplified by the Canadian Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR) or the US Senate Bill 2341.====The picture is not, however, all black and white, as some of the proposed changes are welcomed. For instance, the proposal offers long-awaited clarifications, such as the definition of extraordinary circumstances in Annex 1, reducing the existing uncertainty by providing an exhaustive list of circumstances. Nonetheless, the definitions of some of the circumstances are still vague and might generate as much case-law as it does now. For instance, ‘damage to the aircraft caused by third parties for whom the air carrier, in the absence of contractual relations, is not responsible on the ground prior to departure of the flight and requiring immediate assessment or repair’ will allow airlines to easily escape their liability by claiming there are no contractual relations, which will be impossible for the passengers themselves to verify. Moreover, this revision—if implemented—could take some burden off ground handlers vis-à-vis their airline customers.====Although the proposed revisions are unlikely to succeed in their current form====, as they run contrary to the CJEU case law, the proposed changes demonstrate a bold move from Croatia, and is worrisome for passengers' rights. The disregard to some of the rights granted by the CJEU or even the EU acquis is appalling. In fact, some of the changes seem dictated by economic interests on the side of the State, rather than the interest of all parties. This is problematic as any reform of Regulation 261 needs to balance the needs and rights of all the stakeholders involved, especially airlines and passengers. This balancing exercise is rendered difficult due to the different interests at stake which will have different views depending on these interests. Since the passengers' protection is mainly achieved through Regulation 261, because passengers are excluded from the scope of the consumer rights directive (Directive, 2011/83),==== and their protection is paramount, it is important that the revised version maintain a certain level of protection. Moreover, on top of going against the international trend, some proposed provisions are discriminatory. Finally, some provisions disregarded the suggestions made, at first reading, by the European Parliament (EP) on the 2013 proposal. For the sake of clarity, the EP's amendments have never been accepted and are, therefore, only suggestions.====This article analyses, from a passenger's perspective, the major changes proposed by Croatia in light of the international trend, the existing case law, the 2013 proposal and the EP's amendments. Since the 2020 proposal takes a much more airline-friendly approach, and is detrimental to passengers, the benefits of some of the changes for airlines will be discussed. The two major areas of contention have always been extraordinary circumstance and compensation for delays. A great deal of the existing case law relates to delay. Notoriously, the CJEU extended the right to compensation to long delay in the Sturgeon decision, as this right was not explicitly applicable to delays. This decision significantly extended the scope of the Regulation and was heavily critised (Garben, 2013a, Garben, 2013b). Consequently, this article starts with an analysis of the proposed exhaustive list of extraordinary circumstances and the increase in the length of delay. Linked to the change in length of delay is the welcomed new provision on missed connecting flights, which will be analysed. Then the possible negative consequences of the tarmac delays' provision are examined. Another major drawback in consumer protection is the exclusion of compensation if the disrupted flight departed from or arrived at a small airport or at an airport situated in an outermost region of the EU. While the reasoning behind this rule is understandable, it will likely result in this exemption being beneficial to major airlines and detrimental for passengers. Similarly, this article analyses the proposed provision which would exclude compensation if disrupted flight departed from or arrived at an airport hosting government-subsidised flights. Once again, from a passenger point of view, this provision represents a step in the wrong direction. The right to care was criticised as too much in favour of passengers, as a result, the proposal tries to find a better balance. In its current form, however, the provision is discriminatory for both passengers and major airlines. Another welcome change relates to the clarification of the role of the National Enforcement Bodies (NEB) which might help tackled the CMC proliferation by offering a better alternative to passengers. Finally, some minor changes are addressed, such as cancellation and denial of boarding.",Proposed revisions of regulation 261/2004: Endangering passengers’ rights and going against the international trend?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305883,29 December 2020,2020,Research Article,240.0

This has led to congestion and delays at major airports across the world. The topic of ‘airport capacity management’ (ACM) has thereby attracted considerable scholarly attention. From our review of extant literature, we find an extensive repository of research work related to ACM, vis a vis its inherent role and the expected output. Nevertheless, extant literature has failed to conduct a ==== on ACM in order to understand its evolution over time. Therefore, we analyze ACM literature in detail to grasp and evaluate the work being done thus far, using bibliometric analysis. Our analysis reveals that airport capacity, congestion, competition and ground holding problems are important keywords related to ACM. Further, using co-citation analysis we identify 5 broad clusters and thought pattern of researchers. We also propose a flowchart of literature with major research area related to ACM. Finally, we note that the Journal of Air Transport Management (JATM) with 1086 citations and 109 documents tops the list of journals publishing papers on ACM.","The civil aviation sector has experienced exponential growth over the past few decades, with over 4.3 billion passengers traveling in the year 2018 alone. According to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), this figure is expected to grow further to about 10 billion by 2040 (ICAO, 2018). Moreover, the number of departures is projected to reach at around 90 million by about the same time. Notably, the aviation sector not only provides a worldwide rapid transportation network, but also generates economic growth, jobs, international trade, and tourism. The exponential growth in this aviation sector may be attributed to positive economic externalities that are associated with air connectivity. Specifically, the economic and social impact of metro airport connectivity on remote cities’ regional growth is well established (Yao and Yang, 2008). Remote city connection has therefore attracted the attention of government bodies and airport authorities alike, as they continue to roll out incentives for operating in new air routes (Smyth et al., 2012). Generally, many mechanisms are employed for providing air services to remote areas. A regional connectivity scheme (called UDAN) of the Government of India (GOI), and Route Development Fund (RDF) by the Scotland government are a few examples of incentive-based schemes to promote regional connectivity. Under the UDAN scheme for instance, GOI has pledged a $7.1 billion investment in the aviation sector to connect remote cities with major airports; it is expected to add about 1.3 million passenger seats annually. This has resulted in substantial growth in air transportation, which effectively has emerged as a ‘lifeline service’ to connect remote cities, especially when land transportation is not an easy option (Fageda et al., 2018).====The second factor that has led to the growth in air travel is an increased focus on tourism, as countries continue to promote both international and domestic travels. Today, with a mobile millennial generation, having a higher propensity to fly, is expected to travel more often. This is coupled by higher living standards and disposable incomes in major developing economies. Finally, the third key contributor in the growth of air transportation is the emergence of low-cost carriers (LCC). They carry passengers at lower costs, which in turn has led to substantial growth in air travel demand (Ison, 2017). In fact, low ticket fares have attracted the interest, especially of those, who previously would not have even dreamed of traveling by air (Bachwich and Wittman, 2017). This, in fact, is evident from the increase in flight frequency in Europe, which has doubled from 5 million in 1988 to 10 million, just within a span of two decades (i.e. 2008). Interestingly, the phenomenal growth in air travel has actually outrun the combined capacity of several major airports across the world. Moreover, this is what has led to the supply–demand mismatch in several airports around the globe (Madas and Zografos, 2008). As per the Euro-control report published in 2018, 111 airports have been planning to add 16% capacity between them, which in turn would provide 4 million additional runway movements. However, the growth in the demand for runway movements is expected to be more than 28% at bigger European airports. Importantly, the completion of these expansion plans to be achieved by the set deadline is in itself a very optimistic assumption. Nonetheless, even if they are completed as per plan, the capacity still would not be sufficient, falling short by an estimated gap of 3.7 million runway movements.====In fact, passengers have already begun to experience significant deterioration in the service quality of air travel due to inadequate terminals and runway capacities (Jen et al., 2011). Delayed flights, missed connections, congestion inside the airport terminal, shortage of parking space, and longer waiting times for check-in are have all been plaguing issues due to the continual increase in demand vis a vis the perennial shortage in supply. A recent report by Eurocontrol (2019) mentioned that the average delay time per flight was about 11.4 min, which in fact, is a matter of great concern for both the airline and the passengers, as it is a costly proposition for both (Wang and Wang, 2019). Airports like Charles de Gaulle in Paris, Frankfurt International Airport, and London’s Heathrow have been operating at their maximum capacity. Ironically, these are the world’s largest airports, and are also among the world’s most delayed airports. They have their respective expansion plans, but also have their own set of challenges that include huge investments, coupled with several other constraints like political, environmental, and geographical. Hence, capacity expansion by and large is a time-consuming and a challenging task (Starkie, 1998). Another method to mitigate the congestion issues in airport includes the ‘demand management techniques’. Unlike capacity enhancement, ‘demand management techniques’ do not require long-term investments, and offer an efficient medium to short-term solutions. Furthermore, demand management techniques/strategies, essentially help in managing slots at congested airports. These range from various administrative tools to market-based mechanisms. Under the administrative tools for instance, the government/airport authority allocates scare airport resource (slot) based on rules and regulations, such as grandfather rights, first-come-first-serve, lotteries, new entrant rule, etc. Market-based mechanisms on the other hand, include congestion pricing, auctions, and secondary trading of slots (Madas and Zografos, 2006). In fact, most of the contemporary research on airport capacity management is primarily focused on demand-side solutions to mitigate congestion.====Although a steady research is carried out in the last two decades (as seen from the exponential increase in literature from 2000, see Fig. 1) to solve airport capacity problem, the airport congestion problem is far from over and is now more prevalent and getting severe. A study commissioned by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimated the total cost of congestion to be around $31.2 billion for calendar year 2007 (Churchill et al., 2010). The other externalities of congestion include environmental damage and noise pollution near the congested airports. Several factors have been discussed in existing literature, first to understand, and then solve these congestion related problems. Each of these studies has provided a unique perspective and/or a solution. Based on our literature review, we note that the models that have been proposed in terms of airport capacity management are in themselves quite vast. They range from operational modeling like mixed-integer programming (Ribeiro et al., 2018), queuing theory (Churchill et al., 2013), and heuristic optimization (Zidarova and Zografos, 2011) to economics tools, such as slot auctions design (Sheng et al., 2015, Vossen and Ball, 2006). Hence, it is helpful to fathom the extent to which these dimensions are considered in airport capacity management. ==== Tanrıverdi et al. (2020) ==== Tanrıverdi et al. (2020) ==== In a different study, Bennell et al. (2011) undertake reviews of various modeling techniques, including their assumptions, constraints, and objective functions. They discuss in detail the different solution methods used but do not offer insights on ACM. In fact, most of the work from extant literature seems fragmented. Therefore, we believe that a thorough and in-depth network analysis could possibly provide key insights in identifying influential works on various factors addressing ‘congestion’. Importantly, this paper has been written to try and connect the dots by analyzing extant literature, using rigorous bibliometric techniques. Largely, the research objectives include:====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the methodology of the study and data aggregation steps.

This research, introduces a general framework for measuring ASQ using passengers’ tweets about airports. The proposed framework considers tweets in any language, not just in English, to support ASQ evaluation in non-speaking English countries where passengers communicate with other languages. Accordingly, this work uses a large dataset that includes tweets in two languages (English and Arabic) and from four airports. Additionally, to extract passenger evaluations from tweets, our framework applies two different deep learning models (CNN and LSTM) and compares their results. The two models are trained with both general data and data from the aviation domain in order to clarify the effect of data type on model performance. Results show that better performance is achieved with the LSTM model when trained with domain specific data. This study has clear implications for researchers and airport managers aiming to use alternative methods to measure ASQ.","Airports are an important component in the air transport network and they have been increasingly operated as multiservice firms. Nowadays, management companies of airports around the world are consequently competing to attract more passengers and airline corporations through several services (Gitto and Mancuso, 2017). According to ACI (2016), the quality of airport services is crucial in achieving passenger satisfaction and consequently effects their future intention to use the airport again (Prentice and Kadan, 2019). Therefore, airport management needs first to understand passenger expectations about the services needed and their characteristics and build its improvement plans accordingly (Bezerra and Gomes, 2020; Wattanacharoensil et al., 2017). This passenger-oriented approach should also be followed by all service agencies at airports and airport management should support that orientation (Wattanacharoensil et al., 2017). However, airport services have multiple dimensions and attributes each of which can affect travelers’ satisfaction to a different degree. This complex and competitive environment has raised the need for an efficient evaluation method that: first, helps airport management to understand and measure items (services) that drive passenger satisfaction; and second, enables them to identify their position in the industry relative to others and strive for constant improvement and better management of financial resources. Accordingly, much research has been conducted in the service evaluation area, which can be grouped under two dimensions: (i) identifying service attributes that represent customer satisfaction; and (ii) measuring service quality based on customer feedback.====Research under the first dimension is based largely on surveys that target either experts in the aviation industry (Rhoades et al., 2000; Yeh and Kuo, 2003) or passengers at airports (Allen et al., 2020; Bezerra and Gomes, 2016; Fodness and Murray, 2007) or both (Honga et al., 2020; Xiaobing and Zhuo, 2019). Each study suggests several service attributes under different service categories or dimensions. However, these research studies in summary have not agreed on which attributes identify service quality at airports and drive customer satisfaction (Lee and Yu, 2018). As for the second dimension, i.e., measuring service quality, the process usually follows traditional approaches that utilize questionnaires distributed to a representative sample of passengers at the target airport. For instance, Airports Council International (ACI) is one of the main organizations that conducts an evaluation process for 390 airports in 92 different countries around the world (ACI, 2018). The ACI evaluation program is known as Airport Service Quality program (ACI-ASQ) and their evaluation is based on surveys of airport passengers, which are repeated four times a year. Collecting data in this way has some disadvantages such as the high cost, the limited number of people that it covers (Greaves et al., 2013) and the difficulty in balancing the costs of controlling the process and the expected results (Guo et al., 2017). In addition, traditional questionnaires are time consuming and, for many respondents, awkward to fill out.====Recently, the increasing popularity of social media platforms has seen them become one of the main channels for people to share their opinions and feelings. Nowadays, most product suppliers and service providers use social media actively to listen to and communicate with their customers. Due to their frequent use by customers, User-Generated Content (UGC) on these platforms is considered a valuable source of information for measuring customer satisfaction with products and services in different domains (Greaves et al., 2013; Martin, 2017) including the aviation industry. This online information is not only useful for companies, it is also considered trustworthy by other customers and drives their behavior in selecting related services or products (Brochado et al., 2019). However, dealing with this abundant and ever-increasing amount of online data, consisting mostly of unstructured texts, requires the use of effective and efficient approaches to extract useful information.====In a recent study, Martín-Domingo et al. (2019) used tweets retrieved from airport Twitter accounts to measure airport service quality (ASQ) at London Heathrow airport. This research aims to overcome at least two limitations in that line of research: first, it investigates whether this new approach can be generalized and applied to other airports that use English as well as other languages (e.g. Arabic) to communicate with its passengers; Secondly, it quantifies the performance effects of training two deep neural networks with data from the aviation domain, compared to training the models with more general domain data.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is a review of some of the related work in the domain.

The Single European Sky (SES) initiative from the European Commission initiates this reform, which advances ANSP competition, cost-effectiveness and innovation. While during the COVID crisis, the focus is on the revitalisation of commercial aviation, the challenges to reform European airspace will again attract attention in the post-COVID era.====Such challenges raise several questions for ANSP management as well as for researchers. What are the strategic options available to ANSP management to cope with the faced challenges? Before new models for ANS provision can be developed, it is useful to gain more insight into the current business models deployed.====Previous academic research on the ANS industry has focussed mainly on effects of commercialisation and privatisation (e.g. Majumdar, 1995, Steuer, 2010), pricing issues (e.g. Leal de Matos, 2001, Bolic et al., 2014), and more recently collaboration, consolidation and structural market reform issues (e.g. Adler et al., 2014, Tomová, 2015). While different authors have studied business models of airports (e.g. Kalakou and Macário, 2013) and airlines (e.g. Dewulf, 2014), there seems to be a research gap towards business model developments of ANSPs.====This paper proposes a typology of business models present in the European ANS market anno 2016–2019 and assesses its influence on ATM/CNS profit, in order to provide ANSP management with insights in their strategic options of coping with the changes in the market; and to provide airspace users a better understanding of ANSP’s strategic objectives.====Although a business model approach is tailored to commercial and profit-maximisation-like businesses, it is also well suited to analyse the European ANSP landscape. There is indeed a visible trend towards more commercial activity which is likely to continue after the adoption of the SES 2==== package and beyond (Buyle et al., 2017, Tomová, 2016).

The aim of this research is to determine the factors that influence pilot retention and investigate if these factors differ based on gender, age and level of commercial flying experience of pilots. A mixed methods approach was used. Quantitative information was collected via an online survey sent to 394 Ryanair pilots. Nine in-depth expert interviews were conducted. The pilots ranked, in order of importance, a number of retention-influencing factors spanning seven areas, identified with the help of interviewees and secondary research. The results of the survey indicate that the most important retention influencing factors are being based at home, working a fixed roster pattern for a financially stable airline, being paid a competitive ==== and having job security. This research provides qualitative evidence that airlines can use to develop or update their financial and non-financial benefits packages and where necessary, amend work practices and maximise pilot motivation to stay.","Pilots are one of the most valuable resources to the airline industry. Because of increasing aircraft utilisation and stricter flight time limitation regulations,==== each commercial aircraft requires between 10 and 16 pilots. Moreover, with a mandatory retirement age of 65 for commercial pilots, the civil aviation industry is expected to lose approximately 3% of its pilots each year over the next ten years with the need to recruit and train 110,000 new pilots by 2028 (CAE, 2018). Air traffic growth in regions with developing air transport markets such as the Gulf States and China, has already created a demand for experienced pilots, luring them away from European airlines with offers of extremely generous pay and benefits packages (CAE, 2017) which are well beyond the western airlines’ ability to compete with. In this competitive pilot employment market, where attractive alternative employment opportunities have abounded, pilot turnover rates at some airlines are relatively high. A 2001 study by the Air Transport Association of Canada suggested that when companies were grouped by type of operations, 34% of air taxi operators, 50% of cargo operators, and 50% of commuter operators reported pilot turnover rates in excess of 30% (Kiernan, 2018). The level of disruption as a result of them vacating their employment is significant as is the cost of recruiting, training and inducting their replacements.====Labour turnover has been defined by Robbins and Judge (2007, p. 72) as ‘ … the voluntary and involuntary permanent withdrawal from an organisation”. Employee turnover has been empirically researched in three domains: causes and consequences of employee turnover and workplace retention strategies (Yang et al., 2012). Turnover disrupts various productivity related outcomes and leads to higher cost, reduced effectiveness and efficiency, but also to a dysfunctional organisation climate. Substantial research has been conducted in voluntary turnover. Nevertheless, the turnover of pilots is under-researched.====Some research has been conducted related to the airline employment relations (Fraher, 2017, 2019; Harvey and Turnbull, 2006, 2012; Maxwell and Grant, 2018; Warnock-Smith et al., 2020). Brannigan et al. (2019) have conducted an extensive research on employment and working conditions of aircrews in the EU internal aviation market for the European Commission. Most of the research on pilots’ turnover has been conducted in the context of military as military pilots leave the force and join commercial airlines. Some of the most high profile pilot issues have been noticed in Ryanair. Ryanair Holdings plc is Europe's largest airline group with 2400 daily flights served by 470 aircraft. Ryanair employs over 19,000 staff in 83 bases. O'Sullivan and Gunnigle (2009) suggest that Ryanair has avoided and suppressed unions for a number of years, but the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association (IALPA) has challenged it. In 2017 and 2018, Ryanair had to cancel thousands of flights due to pilot shortages. The Chief Executive Officer characterised the pilots as “glorified bus drivers” who were “very well paid for a very easy job” where “the computer does most of the flying” (Irish Times, 2017). These comments angered many of the pilots who are proud of the skills they possess and perceived it as an attack on their professional reputation. Even though the pilots were offered a 20% pay increase, Ryanair's failure to allow for the higher order needs of their employees led to strike action and eventually to union recognition and in a significant number of cases, long serving, experienced pilots left Ryanair to work at other airlines. A number of papers have been published about Ryanair (e.g. Barrett, 2004; O'Connell and Williams, 2005), but very few consider Human Resources Management (HRM).====The term ‘Entry-level pilots’ refers to a newly hired pilot in the employment of an airline. Harvey and Turnbull (2012) suggest that young pilots in Ryanair are only concerned about accumulating flying hours and then moving to another airline. Retention of high skilled employees is vital for any company and a better understanding of how to retain employees is critical. The aim of this paper is to determine the factors that influence pilot retention and investigate if these factors differ based on gender, age and level of commercial flying experience of pilots. The contribution of this paper is to examine one of the most important parts of labour in the airline industry and shed light into how one of the most controversial employers in the aviation industry manages pilot employee turnover and retention.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present a brief literature review regarding pilot employee relations. In Section 3, we provide the methodological approach followed. Section 4 contains the research results, as well as a discussion on the factors that have affected pilots’ retention at Ryanair.

Consequently, policymakers and scholars view access to transportation as an essential prerequisite for economic development. For aviation, existing empirical studies have attempted to estimate the wider economic impacts from regional, country-level and global perspectives. However, no theoretical framework has yet been presented that comprehensively captures the full set of mechanisms by which aviation can contribute to economic development. Such a framework would cover both positive and negative regional impacts, as well as the mechanisms and spatial distribution behind them. In this paper, we use a New ==== approach to comprehensively describe the impact mechanisms. We then apply this theoretical framework to an empirical study of metrics of air transport supply, which policymakers and researchers can use to assess how well airports and their surrounding regions are connected by means of the air transport network. The results of our analysis can inform scholars and policymakers on how air transport can shape economic geography and the productivity of economic systems. The results might also provide guidance for future empirical work on the wider economic impacts of air transportation.","In a globalising world, economists and policymakers are interested in the roles that geography, centrality and remoteness play in shaping the distribution of economic activity. Some scholars have claimed the ‘End of Geography’ (O'Brien, 1992) or ‘Death of Distance’ (Frances, 2001) due to significant advancements in telecommunications and transportation that have reduced the cost of interaction. For example, the real price of air freight declined by 0.5 per cent per year between 1973 and 1993 (Hummels, 2007).==== Yet, recent evidence still points towards geography playing a substantial role in terms of shaping the distribution of economic activity (e.g. Henderson et al. (2017) and Redding and Turner (2015)). This finding is particularly significant for remote countries such as New Zealand and Australia, where the OECD's 2008 ‘Going for Growth’ report finds that remoteness lowers average GDP per capita by 10 per cent. By contrast, the report associates the centrality of Belgium and the Netherlands with an increase in GDP per capita of more than 5 per cent (OECD, 2008).====Air transportation is the only available means of transporting passengers or goods around the globe within a single day. Therefore, it is often considered a primary driver of globalisation (Hummels, 2007). The aviation industry has grown exponentially in the last decades, driven, among other things, by per capita GDP growth and population growth (Profillidis and Botzoris, 2015). It is argued that aviation causes wider economic impacts outside the aviation industry and its value chain itself (Allroggen, 2013; Lakshmanan, 2011). Although numerous studies have empirically analysed these wider economic impacts (e.g. Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott (2018), Lakew and Bilotkach (2018) and Sheard (2019)), some methodological deficiencies make the causal relationship between aviation and the wider economy an unresolved question (Zak and Getzner, 2014).====Specifically, few efforts have been made to (i) outline the underlying mechanisms and (ii) spatial distribution of the wider economic impacts induced by aviation (Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott, 2018); and (iii) design metrics that capture how air transportation bridges distances, that is, the input that the air transport industry provides to economies (Allroggen, 2013; Lakshmanan, 2011). In practice, scholars and policymakers often rely on traffic volume metrics such as passenger numbers, cargo volume, or aircraft movements to approximate how well regions are connected through air transport systems. However, these metrics reflect market outcomes and might not capture the potential value of an air transport connection for generating market access and hence, economic impacts. In hub-and-spoke networks, for example, the economic value of flight connections to a hub airport can go beyond a single flight to the hub since the connections make numerous onward connections available. Furthermore, often only the localised economic impact is considered; that is, the impact on the nearest region or city. Such local impacts are likely to overstate the overall economic effect of aviation as distant regions might experience smaller or even adverse effects. Lastly, most studies employ reduced-order empirical models that leave no interpretation of the underlying mechanisms.====To bridge these gaps in the literature, we (i) review the New Economic Geography; (ii) structure spatial and aspatial metric concepts for measuring the availability and quality of transport connections; and (iii) empirically compare air connectivity metrics to other metrics of air transport used in economic impact assessments. The results can help scholars and policymakers study the role of air transport networks in creating market access and wider economic impacts.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the present literature on the economic impact of aviation. In Section 3, we present a narrative review of the New Economic Geography (NEG) to derive a common understanding of transport- and non-transport-related interaction costs and their impact mechanisms on economic activity. Section 4 derives policy-relevant versions of the theoretical metrics from Section 3 by classifying geographical and non-geographical drivers of transport costs and subsequent market access. It further empirically compares the metrics defined in Section 4 with commonly used air traffic metrics.

However, some disruptions occur due to mechanical failures and unexpected delays of maintenance, making the aircraft unavailable for a certain period of time. These deviations from the initial plan result in high operational costs in addition to the serious inconveniences experienced by passengers. In order to handle aircraft and passenger recovery problems simultaneously, we work on integrated networks at which aircraft routings and passenger itineraries are superimposed. Consequently, we could calculate the actual profit and cancellation cost by evaluating each passenger itinerary while considering the seat capacity limitations. In our computational results, we use a daily schedule of a major U.S. airline and clearly demonstrate that there is an optimal trade-off between operating and passenger-related costs.","Air transportation fosters mobility and provides a crucial level of connectivity on a global scale. As being a convenient transportation option, the number of passengers who utilize air travel maintains positive growth rates. Due to the high and increasing demand, competition between airlines has intensified in recent years. Each airline aims to capture a greater portion of the market demand and tries to use its resources in the best possible way to enhance the profitability of its operations. Due to the competitive nature of the industry, airlines design tight schedules and utilize their fleet of aircraft as much as possible to generate more profit. They assume that all required resources will be available on time and flights will operate as planned. However, some irregularities might occur during actual operations and original schedules can easily be disrupted. Bratu and Barnhart (2006) discussed main sources of disruption and highlighted the effect of resource shortages including the absence of aircraft. To exemplify, mechanical failures can be observed and aircraft might need to undergo unscheduled maintenance making the aircraft unavailable for a period of time. Such irregularities prevent airlines from continuing their original schedules.====Among airline resources, aircraft is the scarcest one and hence even minor perturbations in aircraft schedules might result in severe disruptions. Flight delays and cancellations become inevitable depending on the unavailability duration. A recent example is that after two fatal crashes of Boeing 737 Max aircraft in October 2018 and March 2019, aviation authorities grounded the entire fleet of that type as a safety precaution. The fleet is not permitted to fly until further notice. This capacity loss critically disrupted initially generated flight schedules of airlines. In particular, Southwest Airlines, Air Canada and American Airlines face the most disruption as they have the highest number of Boeing 737 Max in their fleets (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, 2019). In another recent example, a major US airline has faced unscheduled maintenance disruptions arising from contract negotiations. Unscheduled maintenance can occur anytime and by definition, it is unforeseen. Besides, it is also possible that planned inspections can take longer than anticipated, creating a need for recovery actions. Unless real-time and efficient recovery solutions are readily available, aircraft shortages may result in substantial loss of profit and decrease level of service for airlines in such scenarios.====Re-timing of departures, cancellation of certain flights and swapping aircraft are the most common recovery actions in cases of disruptions. Airline Operations Control Centers (AOCC) are responsible for taking such actions and managing operations of aircraft, crew and passengers centrally. Interdependencies between different entity types make it even more challenging to generate a comprehensive recovery solution. The complexity of networks as well as the high operational costs necessitates the use of optimization tools in this large-scale system. Due to the quick response requirements and large number of variables, proposing a single formulation for the integrated airline recovery problem is not easy. Instead, it is a common practice to adopt sequential approaches which recover aircraft, crew and passenger schedules respectively. However, without using a fully integrated approach, it is not possible to find the optimal trade-off between operating and passenger-related costs. Besides, as passenger recovery corresponds to the final stage in a sequential framework, passengers might experience large impacts of re-timing and cancellation decisions which are made in advance. Therefore, airlines should place a special emphasis on passenger convenience in order to maintain a competitive edge in the market and to increase profit in the long run.====In this study, our aim is to develop a framework to help airlines in handling schedule perturbations specifically caused by the unavailability of aircraft. We address aircraft and passenger recovery problems simultaneously instead of adopting a sequential schedule recovery framework as commonly done in literature. We utilize exchange of aircraft and cruise time controllability along with the cancellation option and propose a novel math-heuristic algorithm. Another point is that we work on integrated networks at which aircraft routings and passenger itineraries are superimposed. Considering the interdependence among entities, cancellation or re-timing decisions which are made for flight legs directly affect itineraries. As a significant contribution, we differentiate between direct and connecting passengers, prioritize affected ones and make individual passenger itinerary based recovery decisions under seat capacity restrictions. This allows us to use limited resources, in our case available seats, in a more effective way. Lastly, due to the high level of competition in airline industry, it is significant to quantify the passenger-related disruption costs and measure the inconvenience if a flight is cancelled, and hence we provide actual cancellation cost formulations by evaluating each itinerary separately.====In sum, the main contributions of this study can be listed as follows:====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing studies on disruption management, especially the studies on passenger and aircraft recovery.

This issue makes the mode choice to access the airports important to study on and develop policies regarding it. Many studies show destination type as domestic or international affects the airport access mode choice, along with other factors. In this study, we investigate the effect of destination type of mode choice using mixed logit, using market segmentation approach. Market segmentation regarding destination type as domestic or international is a first in airport access mode choice modeling. Revealed-preference data was collected by face-to-face passenger surveys at Ataturk International Airport in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2015. We did market segmentation analysis for Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Mixed Logit (ML) models. When MNL and ML models were compared, it was observed that ML was superior to MNL. Further, results of market segmentation analysis revealed that using segmented models produced more accurate results than using the pooled model; both in MNL and ML. This finding was also supported by the value of time estimates; there were significant differences between domestic and international travel markets in terms of airport access mode choice. These results showed that different transportation policies may be introduced for domestic and international traveler segments, which also were explained.","Cities grow because of the population increase, and this also results in the growth in air transportation. Excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, the air transportation market has been expanding. This situation makes the state of airports important and access to them. Istanbul, being one of the most populous cities in the world, is no exception to that situation.====Istanbul has three airports: Ataturk International Airport (ISL), Sabiha Gokcen International Airport (SAW), and the recently opened Istanbul Airport (IST). Before IST was opened, ISL served as the major airport in the city, and IST was used for Ataturk International Airport by IATA. In this paper, to avoid ambiguity, we used IST for the recently opened Istanbul Airport. It opened in October 2018, but the complete transition from ISL to IST was made in April 2019. After the transition was completed, ISL lost its status from the major airport to IST. ISL used to serve as the major hub for Turkish Airlines (THY), and SAW is the hub of Pegasus Airlines, a low-cost carrier.====Being the largest airport in Turkey, ISL carried over 61 million passengers only in 2015 with an increase of 8% compared to 2014. Approximately 42 million of these passengers were international passengers, most of them were transiting through ISL. The total number of passengers carried in Turkey was around 181 million, meaning that ISL carried one-third of the whole air passengers (General Directorate of State Airports Authority of Turkey, 2016). Because of the high and increasing demand for air traffic, the city's traffic congestion worsens. Therefore, assessing the mode choice behavior of the passengers' airport access is very important to control traffic congestion and to introduce new transportation policies.====Many studies suggested the destination type of passengers affects the airport access mode choice. A study suggests that domestic business passengers use a private vehicle and pay a parking cost more than international business travelers because of the short duration of the trip (Psaraki and Abacoumkin, 2002). The same conclusion is also obtained in another study that suggests that international passengers are less likely to use parking areas or rental cars compared to domestic passengers. Besides higher parking costs, another reason is the unfamiliarity of the drivers, therefore international passengers mostly prefer modes such as taxis, shared limos, and chartered buses (Gupta et al., 2008). The arriving time also plays an important role in the mode choice of passengers, because most domestic passengers arrive 30–90 min earlier than their flight, while international passengers arrive at least 90 min before (Psaraki and Abacoumkin, 2002).====It is important to note that the destination type is not the sole variable affecting the mode choice. Some other factors are airport access time, cost of travel, demographics, and purpose of the trip (business vs non-business). Especially, whether the trip is for business changes the mode choice behavior of passengers drastically (Akar, 2013; Choo et al., 2013; Gupta et al., 2008; Pels et al., 2003). For business travelers, the willingness to pay to reduce travel time is higher (Koster et al., 2011). They give more value to both travel time and the safety margin of the mode (Tam et al., 2008). The safety margin of mode was also found to be increased when a mode with lower travel time reliability was chosen for airport access (Tam et al., 2011). Except for trip purpose, access time and access cost are two of the most important factors that affect mode choice behavior (Choo et al., 2013; Gupta et al., 2008; Hess, 2007; Jou et al., 2011; Monteiro and Hansen, 1996). According to Alhussein (2011), income level, luggage amount, and time to access the airport also play an important role in the mode choice of the passengers. Most of the studies suggest that demographics such as age, gender, or automobile ownership affect the passengers’ decision on airport access mode choice (Akar, 2013; Budd et al., 2011; Choo et al., 2013; Gupta et al., 2008).====Models to estimate airport mode choice include discrete choice methods such as MNL (Akar, 2013; Alhussein, 2011; Choo et al., 2013; Tam et al., 2008) and Mixed Logit (ML) (Birolini et al., 2019; Jou et al., 2011).====Jou et al. (2011) and Birolini et al. (2019) used ML to model airport access mode choice in Taipei and Milan, respectively. They both have treated travel time variables (both in-vehicle and out-of-vehicle) as random. However, Jou et al. (2011) assumed those cost variables were individual-specific. Birolini et al. (2019) added trip cost as a variable with random parameters. Hess and Polak (2005) used ML in airport choice, rather than access mode choice, nevertheless, they showed the application of this technique in air travel demand. They found access time to the airport was an important factor in airport choice, an explanatory variable that is frequently used in airport access mode choice studies.====As explained later, this work makes use of market segmentation. Therefore, it is worth explaining some research about different travel markets and their effects on air travel behavior. Brons, Pels, Nijkamp and Rietveld (2002) revealed that passengers from different cultures may have different perceptions of the price of air travel. Elasticities for travel distance also varied between different markets in a study made in the U. S (Bhadra and Kee, 2008). Air travel behavior differences were also observed between passengers with unique characteristics related to trips (Cha et al., 1995; Wen et al., 2008).====Also, discrete choice models were previously used in air travel to model the passenger itinerary choices in different markets. Coldren, Koppelman, Kasturirangan and Mukherjee (2003) used Multinomial Logit (MNL) to model the passengers' itinerary choice based on the airline's service characteristics for different city pairs; hence, markets. Similar work was also made by Lurkin et al. (2017, 2018) and extended using Nested Logit (NL) and Ordered Generalized Extreme Value (OGEV) models. Further, Birolini et al. (2020) developed two NL models for the passenger's itinerary choice for the long-haul and medium-haul travel markets.====In this paper, we aimed to answer the following questions:====Even though ISL is now closed for domestic and international flights, the results will be useful for understanding the existing preferences of passengers; and developing policies regarding the travel between recently opened IST airport and locations in Istanbul.====This paper is organized: The second section introduces the data. The third and fourth sections explain the theory and explanatory variables in the study. They are followed by the analysis and results of the work in the fifth section.

The findings indicated significant effects of predictors, including reported arrivals and departures, arrival and departure demands, capacity, efficiency, and traffic volume at the origin and destination airports on the risk of flight delays. More importantly, causal interrelationships among variables in a fully structural network are presented to how these predictors interact with one another and how these interactions lead to delay incidents. Finally, sensitivity analysis and causal inference can be performed to evaluate various what-if scenarios and form effective strategies to mitigate the risk of delays.","Flight delays have become a chronic and critical issue for the economy. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) reported an on-time airline arrival rate of 79.6 percent in January 2018; JetBlue Airways has the lowest on-time arrival rate of 65.8 percent (BTS, 2008). Flight delays have negative impacts on the economy. It was estimated that the per-minute-cost of delays to U.S. airlines was $68.48 per minute in 2017, 7.4 percent more than in 2016 (A4A, 2017). Additionally, the delays also affect the market shares and reputation of airlines and airports (Peterson et al., 2013).====The frequency of flight delays and delay time have negative impacts on the aviation industry, airlines reputation, and airport operations. Understanding and mitigating the risk of flight delays in the National Airspace System (NAS) is a primary long-term objective of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The NAS is one of the largest and most complex stochastic systems in the world, which consists of a number of people, procedures, infrastructure, and equipment needed to facilitate safe and on-time air travel in the U.S. and over the world. The complexity of the NAS and changing environment existing in its components create significant difficulties in predicting the risk of delays in the system.====The purpose of this paper is to use causal machine learning to construct a structural causal network from data to examine causal interrelationships among airport variables and delay incidents in a complex system. The causal network is also used to build a predictive model that predicts the risk of flight delays. While existing literature shows many attempts in predicting flight delays, the application of data mining in detecting unknown patterns among variables, especially the causal relationships among variables in a complex network, is relatively limited. Existing studies focus primarily on either examining direct, linear correlations between predictors and the risk of delays using traditional statistical methods with small sample size or finding the best model to predict the risk of delays by comparing multiple machine learning algorithms without investigating the interrelationships among variables (Lorentson, 2011; Parker et al., 2010; Dhal et al., 2013; Avery and Balakrishman, 2015; Xu et al., 2008; Zhang and Nayak, 2012; Truong et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2012; Wang, 2011; Kulkarni et al., 2013; Nugroho and Fahmi, 2017; Kalliguddi and Leboulluec, 2017). Few studies that examined the causal interrelationships among variables tend to be theory-driven; i.e., they theorized the causality among selected variables in a small-scaled network based on expert opinions and/or literature instead of learning the causal structure from data (Liu and Ma, 2008; Cheng at al., 2019; Laskey et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2007). Given the complexity and dynamism of NAS, in order to better mitigate the risk of flight delays in the system, it is essential to examine causal interrelationships among variables and the delay incidents in a large structural network. However, given the large number of variables in NAS, it is not practical to construct such a large network based on literature or expert opinions since this approach does not allow to include a large number of variables in the model and is unable to capture the dynamism of the system. It also does not take advantage of the large amount of data collected in NAS. This paper contributes to the flight delay literature by using causal machine learning to learn and construct a large structural network from data to examine the causal patterns among predictors and how they can predict the risk of flight delays. As components in NAS change, the model can be updated to reflect the dynamism of the system. The FAA, airports, and airlines can use the findings of this research to predict the risk of delays and establish necessary mitigation strategies.====This paper proposes a six-step causal data mining process, USELEI (====), that enables researchers to build a valid and accurate full causal network. The network is used to predict the probability of a delay incident and to identify significant predictors and their effects on the target variable, the risk of arrival delay. Specific causal learning algorithms are recommended for supervised learning and the construct of a full causal network from data. Additionally, sensitivity analysis and causal inference in this process allow decision makers to develop various what-if scenarios, which will help them form effective strategies to manage and mitigate the risk. The USELEI process differs from the current data mining processes in the literature in two specific steps, learning, and Inferring, which are unique to causal machine learning. These steps provide detailed guidance in constructing a valid causal network and conducting causal inference. Causal machine learning is a unique method compared to other machine learning algorithms, and it requires more specific steps in the supervised learning step to find the best causal network. Additionally, it also has specific requirements in the causal inference step to understand the relationships among predictors and the target variable. This process can be applied for predicting the risk of delays in many different areas, including aviation, transportation, disaster management and recovery, finance, insurance, and healthcare.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a review of the relevant literature review in flight delay prediction and causal machine algorithms. Then, research methodology is discussed, including data sources, sampling, algorithms, and the USELEI process. In the next section, the detailed results are presented and explained, along with the validation step.

In line with this aim, a pool of senior executives were interviewed through semi-structured interviews drawing on the new institutional theory assumptions. The data obtained from the participants were supplemented with a set of secondary data from many other sources. The MAXQDA program was used to analyze the data obtained. The findings revealed that the business model of Turkish Airlines has evolved over time, and this evolution can be explained by the new institutional theory assumptions.","Though the subject of business model is one of the most frequently researched topics in the literature, it has been criticized for its lack of theoretical foundations (Foss and Saebi, 2017). Although researchers frequently study the conceptualization of business models (Massa et al., 2017) business model change (Cozzolino et al., 2017; Sund et al., 2014) performance relationship (Zott and Amit, 2007; Sohl and Vroom, 2014; Aversa and Haefliger, 2015), very few studies (Laïfi and Josserand, 2016; Vaskelainen and Münzel, 2017; Laasch, 2018) examine the change of business models at the macro level, as stated by (Foss and Saebi, 2017). Especially considering the research on the business models of airlines (Wensveen and Leick, 2009; Daft and Albers, 2013; Lohmann and Koo, 2013), very few studies have attempted to offer theory-driven explanations for the business model change. Therefore, this study is aimed at making a contribution to the literature by addressing this empirical indifference.====In the organizational field of air passenger transportation, business models have been observed to change over time; the current study focuses on the way this change takes place, the factors causing it, and whether it can be explained from the perspective of the new institutional theory. The question of whether the change by airlines in their business models is driven by the institutions, institutional logic and/or their motivation to gain legitimacy has necessitated an analysis within the framework of the new institutional theory.

Although the number of air passengers has continuously increased, the flight delay rate has fluctuated from year to year. In this study, a ====.","Since the 2000s, the entry of several low-cost carriers into the South Korean air transport industry has led to a significant industrial growth. As of 2020, compared with past years when Korean Air and Asiana Airlines competed only with each other, nine South Korean national airlines are participating in the South Korean air transport business. Passenger demand and flight operations have increased; however, major airports, including Incheon (ICN====), Gimpo (GMP), Gimhae (PUS), and Jeju (CJU) international airports, can no longer fully meet this demand. This has caused more short-to-medium air routes to connect other South Korean local airports with airports in China, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries. International airports, such as Daegu (TAE), Muan (MWX), Cheongju (CJJ), and Yangyang (YNY), are local airports where international flights were rarely offered in the past.====Passengers and airlines prefer local international airports for the following reasons. Since the commencement of ICN in 2001, the South Korean government has been controlling flights to and from GMP, enforcing a strict policy that restricts international flights to only Osaka (Kansai airport, KIX), Tokyo (Haneda airport, HND), Beijing (Shoudu airport, PEK), Shanghai (Hongqiao airport, SHA), and Taipei (Songshan airport, TSA). GMP is located inside the city to carry business travelers and retains night curfews, which has resulted in the stabilization of the line since 2012 (Fig. 1 (b)). CJU is the only airport located on Jeju Island, which has observed a constant inflow of domestic tourists annually (Fig. 1 (a)). Fig. 1 (c) shows large fluctuations in the total number of passengers that occurred because of diplomatic disputes with the Chinese government related to THAAD deployment in 2017. Meanwhile, domestic flights from inland areas overwhelmed the airport capacity of CJU. PUS has attracted passengers, especially for Southeast Asian countries, since 2010 (Fig. 1 (d)) and has nearly reached its maximum capacity for the last few years. Consequently, these restrictions induced more international flights to be offered at TAE, MWX, and CJJ since 2016.====The need to resolve problems relating to flight delays and cancellations typically increases with air transportation demand. However, the flight delay rate is apparently not proportionate to the demand. The recent 5-year trend of delays and cancellations has shown no particular pattern between the number of flights and the delay/cancellation rates (see Fig. 2). Other transportation means, such as trains and road vehicles, usually follow the pattern of an increased travel time corresponding to an increased number of passengers. For air transportation, however, external factors, including airport structural characteristics, internal airline problems, weather restrictions maintenance issues, and hectic flight schedules, are the main causes of delays and cancellations, not congestion in airports or air routes.====Flight delays are caused by various factors. In this study, we examined how flight delays (delay time) are influenced by various factors, such as airports, airlines, time slots, and flight schedules. Variables derived from the flight operation raw data were utilized to determine the extent of each delay time using survival analysis. This study particularly focused on examining the influence of the flight schedule buffer on the flight delay and whether the presence of the buffer mitigates the flight delay. We analyzed the flights departing from South Korea and applied the turnaround buffer reflecting the actual arrival time of the previous flight.====In South Korea, flights are regarded as delayed at takeoff/landing after 30 min and 60 min from STD/STA==== for domestic flights and international flights, respectively. Therefore, flights that are delayed by less than 30 or 60 min are not considered. In this study, we analyzed the “delay time” of each flight without any exception of a delay rate. Flight delay is one of the factors that significantly affect the airport or airline choices of the users and is perceived as a more direct indicator than the delay rate by the users (Kurtulmuşoğlu et al., 2016; Lee and Yip, 2017).====This paper is structured in seven sections, beginning with the context and the research problem definition (section 1) followed by the theoretical and analytical background (section 2).

It is the first paper that documents LCC contributions to the passenger traffic and cheaper fares in Northeast Asia (NEA)'s intra-markets. We argue that a single aviation market can facilitate the growth of the LCC sector, which in turn will make a significant contribution to the NEA connectivity, mobility, and integration. In addition, with a single aviation market, NEA countries can adopt a proactive, unified approach in negotiating air transport agreements with the major aviation partners to maximize the interests of this region as a whole, which will further provide valuable growth opportunities for the LCCs.","Air transport is a significant sector in China, Japan and South Korea: in 2017 the three countries ranked the 2nd, 6th and 8th, respectively in the world in terms of total ton-kilometers performed.==== The size of the aviation market of the three countries in total is comparable with that of the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). However, the overall market share of the low-cost carrier (LCC) sector in this region is well below the world's average.==== In 2018, the domestic LCC penetration rates measured by the number of seats in China, Japan and Korea were 10%, 17%, and 53%, respectively. These three figures for the international services were 14%, 26% and 35% (CAPA, 2019). Although LCCs are a relatively new phenomenon in Northeast Asia (NEA),==== there have been a growing body of literature examining the development and influence of the LCCs in this region. However, most of the studies only examine a single country's LCCs with a focus on the domestic market. For example, Zhang and Lu (2013) explored the impact of China's LCC on the passenger traffic flow. Fu et al. (2015) considered LCC's entry decision and competition strategies in China and claimed that LCC is still not a game changer due to their limited presence in the domestic market. Studies on Korean LCCs concentrate on their impact on the tourism industry. Chung and Whang (2011) found that Korean LCCs generate new travel demand to Jeju Island. Research on the Japanese LCCs emphasizes that the well-developed high-speed rail (HSR) system does not give much survival space to LCCs in the domestic market (Hanaoka, 2018).==== However, studies on the NEA LCCs' international services are rare. In particular, research into the impacts of LCCs on the international routes linking China, Japan, and Korea is lacking. This research aims to fill this gap by examining the impacts of LCCs on the airfares and traffic flows between these three countries.

Brazil is currently with another 22 airports “in the oven”, with the new concession round expected in 2021. So, one might think, everything is jolly, right? It's a mixed answer, as many of the airports are underperforming against expectation and, Viracopos, one of the crown jewels, is nearly bankrupt. Now how did that happen?====Demand forecasting is one of the pillars of any transportation study. From the demand and, above all, from the future demand, we may calculate fare revenue and size infrastructure requirements (derived from peak hour passenger and aircraft movements). In the technical feasibility studies of the aforementioned Brazilian airports, we observed the predominant use of ordinary least squares models for forecasting demand, but with considerable heterogeneity regarding model specification and specification tests. In general, we note a low scientific rigor in these analyzes, exemplified by the absence and/or failure of specification tests.====The problem is that depending on the specification and fit of the econometric models, demand forecast could vary considerably, with potentially large implications – affecting infrastructure requirement triggers, grant values and even the feasibility of the concession itself.====The purpose of this paper is to elaborate a detailed analysis of the challenges found in developing and using econometric models to project future transportation demand.

Both networks change with time, indicating that evolving external economic factors influence the network. This study is the pioneer in using Bayesian network analysis to analyze aviation networks. We identify how airport passenger and cargo volumes change with respect to different degrees of economic factors change. In addition, the Bayesian network exhibits the output in a probabilistic way to fully address the uncertainty worldwide. The findings could potentially facilitate policymakers’ decisions to improve global aviation network development.","The airline industry has grown steadily for decades. Global air traffic is expected to maintain an annual growth rate of 4.6–4.9% over the next 20 years (Airbus, 2015, p. 14; Boeing, 2015, p. 23), which means traffic volume is expected to double in 15 years. The development of aviation businesses and the accessibility to these air travel services have long been known to contribute to regional economies, and vice versa the economic growth also boosts the airline industry (Baker et al., 2015; Hakim and Merkert, 2016; Tolcha et al., 2020).====It is of particular interest to study which factors affect passenger and cargo volumes at different airports. The literature has acknowledged that economic factors are the most important contributors to the volume of air transportation. While it is generally recognized that deregulation boosts demand in the aviation market (Kasarda and Green, 2005; Micco and Serebrisky, 2006; Hwang and Shiao, 2011), many other factors influence air travel. Some researchers separate these factors into geo-economic and service-related groups (Grosche et al., 2007). Among the geo-economic factors, distance, fare and population size (Alexander and Merkert, 2017; Suryani et al., 2010; Hwang and Shiao, 2011; Chi and Baek, 2012a) are commonly believed to be the main factors affecting air traffic. GDP and income are also considered to have positive impacts on air traffic (Suryani et al., 2010; Kopsch, 2012; Lo et al., 2015; Wadud, 2014; Fernandes et al., 2019). Hakim and Merkert (2019) found that fuel prices, FDI, industrialization degree are also a significant factor influencing air demand in South Asian countries. Among service-related factors, time is always an important variable impacting air travel, as aviation is a time-sensitive industry. According to Hsiao and Hansen (2011), flight frequency and direct routing greatly influenced air transport, as these two factors increased the convenience of travel. In addition to these frequently discussed issues, factors that are hard to classify, like economic shocks, transportation cost, competition from sea freight (Alexander and Merkert, 2020) and safety (Tacker et al., 2013), are also believed to affect air demand. Some studies of the factors affecting air demand are summarized in Table 1.====Most studies use statistical techniques such as regressions, correlation analysis, and logit models. They identify the significant factors affecting aviation networks and quantify the positive or negative relationship between the factors and aviation passenger volume. Another stream of research methodology applies network theory to model air transportation. Each airport is represented as a node, and direct flights between airports are represented by edges. Each edge is weighted according to the number of seats available on the corresponding flight. For example, Guimera et al. (2005) analyzed the degree and node strength distributions, degree-degree correlations, and density of triangles in the world airport network. Barrat et al. (2004) found non-linear correlations between network topology and the volume of passengers. Sales-Pardo et al. (2007) used graph clustering techniques to analyze the world airport network. They classified airports according to world airport network connectivity patterns. Gautreau et al. (2009) investigated the seasonal effects in the dynamics of the US airport network. Wang et al. (2011) studied China's airport network using complex networks, network structure, and the nodal centrality of individual cities. This stream of research is essentially a deterministic approach that is more suitable for studying the physical connections of world airports. In summary, it is difficult to use existing methods to envisage how the factors affect aviation passenger and cargo volume in a finer setting using these tools. For example, the GDP growth rate is believed to positively affect the aviation network. But low, medium, and high GDP growth rates may have totally different effects on the growth of aviation passenger volume. Previous studies fall short of providing insight into this possibility.====This paper fills this research gap by investigating how the degree of changes of each factor affects passenger and cargo volumes. We make the following contributions to aviation network analysis. First, we identify the strength with which each factor affects world aviation volume by synchronizing data from various resources. Major economics-related factors, i.e., GDP, population, jet fuel price, inflation and exchange rate, of 45 Alpha cities over ten years were collected. They were further discretized to reflect the degree of changes using domain knowledge in economics. Second, we recast the aviation network analysis from a probabilistic perspective to better reflect the uncertain nature of economics and industry. The rationale for this is that even for the same changes in the significant factors, the world aviation network may change differently due to uncertainty. For example, if GDP grows by 4%, total cargo volume will increase by 8–10% with a probability of 0.7, by 5–8% with a probability of 0.2, and below 5% with a probability of 0.1. To realize this goal, Bayesian networks are trained on the data to quantify the relationship between important factors and volumes. Bayesian networks consist of arcs connecting nodes representing potentially significant factors, and a conditional probability table associated with each arc. The results tell us which factors directly impact passenger and cargo volumes, while the probability tables address how the factors affect passenger and cargo volumes. Finally, we have some new findings which are useful for industrial practitioners or policymakers to make decisions. For example, GDP and inflation directly influence passenger and cargo volume, but the cargo network is less sensitive to GDP and inflation changes than the passenger network. Equipped with this tool and data on a large scale, we believe more insights can be found to facilitate policymakers’ decisions to improve global aviation network development.",How influential factors affect aviation networks: A Bayesian network analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305779,1 December 2020,2020,Research Article,254.0

However, there is still much concern about consumer willingness to fly in these vehicles, particularly because they are fully autonomous. The general public has traditionally been reluctant to engage with autonomous flights in commercial or private aviation, and trusts autonomous aircraft less (Hughes et al., 2009; Mehta et al., 2017; Rice et al., 2014; Rice and Winter 2015). If UAM businesses wish to be successful in this emerging market, they need to understand their customers’ concerns and tailor their marketing strategy to this end.====While comfort and convenience are of some importance to consumers, prior research has shown that potential passengers are mostly concerned about their personal safety and how an autonomous aircraft would respond to system failures (Vance and Malik, 2015). The concern for personal safety was echoed in studies of autonomous ground vehicles in which people were less willing to ride in autonomous vehicles than human-controlled vehicles (Anania et al., 2018b; Winter et al., 2018a, Winter et al., 2018b).====Knowing this concern grounded in prior studies, businesses should consider investigating how safety systems in their aircraft might address passenger concerns. Early research in this field has found that passengers are more willing to fly in an autonomous aircraft if it has safety features such as airframe parachutes or an emergency remote pilot system (Ward et al., 2019). Both of these additions address concerns about surviving an incident where the autonomous system fails completely, and a crash is imminent. The purpose of the current study is to take these findings one step further by examining how the presence of airframe parachutes and remote pilot systems can mitigate consumer fear and increase willingness to fly in autonomous UAM aircraft, as well as to investigate the reasons why consumer willingness differs between nationalities.","Safety systems, culture, and willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis: A multi-study and mediation analysis",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305585,30 November 2020,2020,Research Article,255.0

These external factors may impose operational constraints and generate demand-capacity imbalances, leading to reduced on-time performance, additional airline costs and inconveniences to passengers. Efficient management of such disruptions requires an understanding of the main causes of flight delays towards increasing their predictability. In this study, we investigate the impacts of airport surface weather conditions on the likelihood of flight delays for the Brazilian domestic air transportation system. We use historical flight schedule, on-time performance and weather data and estimate a logit model to analyze how different meteorological variables at the airport of destination affect the probability of a delayed arrival. We obtain empirical evidence for the impacts of low ceiling and visibility conditions, precipitation and wind gusts on the likelihood of arrival delays for the set of Brazilian airports analyzed.","On-time performance (OTP) is a relevant output in transportation. Not only does it influence the costs and environmental impacts of the transportation sector, but also consumer choice among available travel options (Gayle and Yimga, 2018). Several structural and operational factors affect the on-time performance of transportation. Weather is one of these major factors. Chen and Wang (2019) point out the weather impact on high-speed rail and air transportation for main city pairs in China. The study reveals that the OTP of high-speed rail and aviation operations varies substantially both spatially and temporally, and is significantly impacted by meteorological conditions.====In the aviation sector, weather is a key determinant of the capacity of airport and airspace resources, affecting airline, airport and air traffic operations. It influences the selection of airport runway and airspace configurations and directly impacts their throughput performance. Rainfalls, for instance, can result in reduced visibility, potentially restricting the use of runways and causing additional safety separations that reduce airport throughput. Therefore, adverse weather conditions often contribute to demand-capacity mismatches, which may generate flight delays and cancellations, reducing the OTP (FAA and Eurocontrol, 2019). In the U.S., for example, weather accounted for 57% of the National Aviation System (NAS) delays in 2019 (U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2020). This share becomes even higher if delays propagated in the network are considered. Due to the interdependencies between flight, aircraft and crew schedules in airline operations, weather impacts may spill over, as pointed by Feng et al. (2017) in their study about the delay cascade effects in complex networks.====As flight delays result in several costs for airlines, passengers and society (Britto et al., 2012; Serhan et al., 2018), there has been substantial research dedicated to flight delay analysis and to the development of strategies that can help mitigating them. A portion of these studies has focused on analyzing the particular relation between weather and operations towards better understanding its impacts on on-time performance. Such knowledge can be used to predict weather impacts for improved decision support in airline, airport and air traffic management.

With 200 questionnaires analyzed, the results suggest that service quality and price have a positive significant impact on passenger satisfaction, and as a result lead to passengers’ loyalty. Besides, the findings of this research also confirm the mediating role of customer satisfaction between service quality and loyalty, price and loyalty separately, which implies that customer satisfaction is a vital factor for an LCCs to survive in such a highly competitive aviation market.","Due to the epidemic spread in Southeast Asia, the business environment has changed rapidly and greatly. Service-providing companies, especially the airlines, are bleeding and facing great challenges that they have never faced before as their flights have been cancelled and their aircrafts have been grounded for months to tackle with the COVID-19 pandemic. At such a critical time, making airlines survive is a big issue and priority task to be considered seriously by management of airlines as well as government. Therefore, the question on how to retain the customers and satisfy their expectations is a crucial factor to be explored in order to ensure the survival of airlines. According to Kotler et al. (1996), it is much easier to obtain purchases from old passengers compared to new passengers, which indicates those old passengers are more loyal than the new passengers. In other words, it is vital for airline companies to retain their current customers from switching to any other airlines (Calisir et al., 2016). Thus, it can be seen that passengers' loyalty is one of the competitive strengths that need to be cultivated for airlines (Akamavi et al., 2015) because it is related to passengers' repurchase intentions (Dolnicar et al., 2011), which in return helps airlines to build a corporate advantage to earn above-normal returns. Therefore, developing and adopting the right policy and strategies to enhance passengers’ loyalty is an important and significant strategy in such a rapidly changed and competitive environment (Vlachos and Lin, 2014).====Measuring customer loyalty in the aviation industry is becoming ever more frequent and relevant due to the fact that the delivery of high-quality service is essential for airlines' survival and crucial to the competitive strengths of the airlines (Tsafarakis et al., 2018). As a result, providing high-quality service has become a requirement in the market among air carriers. Even if airline companies might have a good willingness to provide superior services to all their customers, they often failed to fulfill the needs of their customers because they cannot satisfy the expectations of different range of customers, which is impractical and non-profitable. In addition, service quality provided by airlines does positively affect passengers' satisfaction (Hussain et al., 2015; Saha and Theingi, 2009; Singh, 2015), enhances passengers’ loyalty (Akamavi et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2001; Mikulić and Prebežac, 2011; Saha and Theingi, 2009). As a result, studying service quality can provide airlines with a powerful instrument to obtain their business strategic goals (Wu and Cheng, 2013).====Compared with full-service airlines, low cost carriers (LCCs) focus only on the most basic transportation function. Other elements of the product are either not offered separately, or not offered at all, i.e. additional charges for luggage, food and beverage, hot seats (Schlumberger and Nora, 2014) and etc. The LCCs aims at saving operational cost and then translates the cost into lower, more affordable airfares for the traveling public, thus, attract more passengers to travel by their flights (Schlumberger and Nora, 2014). However, the previous studies exclude the element of price when studying passengers’ behavioral intentions (Ali et al., 2015; Farooq et al., 2018) as these two past studies aim at full-service airlines, and the passengers who take full-service airlines are less price sensitive. Based on the research conducted by Curry and Gao (2012), the price has a large relationship with customer loyalty among leisure travelers, thus, it can be seen that the impact of airfares should be taken into account when conducting research to explore passengers' loyalty, especially in the LCCs industry.====In order to fill-up these research gaps, this paper proposed and tested a conceptual framework engaging both service quality (as AIRQUAL model was the first model studied from the context of LCCs in Southeast Asia) and price in order to gain a better understanding of the impacts of these two attributes on customer loyalty. Furthermore, this study also extends previous literature by examine the mediation effect of satisfaction in explaining passengers’ loyalty in Southeast Asian aviation market, a topic that has been rarely studied in previous literature altogether. Against this background, the main research objectives of this study are to examine service quality based on AIRQUAL model and price affecting customer loyalty among LCCs passengers and to examine mediating effects (satisfaction) on the relationship of services quality, price and loyalty.====Specifically, this study make contributions as follows: First, it adds to the very limited research on Southeast Asia aviation market in terms of airline service quality, the importance of appropriate air tickets pricing, satisfactions and loyalty. Besides, it provides empirical evidence for the relationship between passengers' satisfaction and passengers’ loyalty in the Southeast Asia.====Second, the findings of this research will not only provide the policymaker and the management of LCCs with useful information on how to develop competitive strategies to retain customers after the ease of Covid-19, but also reveal what are the important items or factors appreciated most by passengers, which will help LCCs management in deciding on how to allocate their tangible resources effectively. The faster LCCs recap their old passengers, the easier for those LCCs to survive and to get recovery from the pandemic outbreak in the Southeast Asia. Therefore, this paper is practical and realistic to reflect current economic situations.====Third, from the perspective of conceptual framework, this paper provides evidence to the influence of service quality and price on passengers' loyalty through passengers' satisfaction. Besides that, this study is the first study adopts the AIRQUAL model as five dimensions of service quality to explore its impact on passengers' loyalty in the context of LCCs in Southeast Asia. To our knowledge, there has been no study related to the aviation market, especially, LCCs, in which all the above mentioned factors are being modelled together. Therefore, this research extends the previous literature and enlighten better understanding of previous studies. Further, according to Oliver (1999), passengers is more loyal once they get satisfied, which indicates passengers' satisfaction is a big driven factor to retain customers in the aviation industry. As a result, the mediating effect of satisfaction is studied in this paper, indicating the “satisfaction-loyalty” full circle is introduced as most of the previous studies only focus on passengers' satisfaction (Farooq et al., 2018; Ali et al., 2015) and passengers’ loyalty separately (Calisir et al., 2016; Akamavi et al., 2015; Dolnicar et al., 2011; Mikulić and Prebežac, 2011).",The impact of service quality and price on passengers' loyalty towards low-cost airlines: The Southeast Asia perspective,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305494,21 November 2020,2020,Research Article,257.0

The chosen case studies regard different remote regions (ONU, 2018) of three different countries (Italy, Norway, Cyprus), considering couples of near airports (====). The paper focuses the analysis on four couples of near airports, two from the South of Italy (Bari and Brindisi in the Apulia Region; Palermo and Trapani in Sicily), one in the North of Norway (Bødo and Narvik in Hålogaland) and the last one in the Republic of Cyprus (Larnaca and Paphos).====A ==== analytic methodology has been used to describe the differences between the different couples of airports.

Those remote, but touristic, contexts allow to assess the different weight of the touristic traffic on the economic development of different couples of city-airports, and to address the evaluation on the diverse types of perspective growth.====Since in every couple there is one bigger airport, the paper considers different indicators to the different relation systems: competition and cooperation are always defined by the specific region in which every airport is placed.====The paper is structured as follows:====The overall adopted methodology is partially descriptive and partially GIS-based, since the goal of the paper is to describe the development of couples of close airports from a regional planning point of view.====The GIS database implemented refers to different population catchments areas and to a target of the different economic patterns derived.

Travel times and speed path were used to describe every route, terrestrial, maritime (coast ship) and aerial. The frequency of population transported by the different transportation modes types became the tool to understand how much catchment areas change during the year and according to the weight of tourism in different airports.

This area has been widely applied in service industries that are characterized by a fixed perishable capacity, such as airlines, cruises, hotels, etc.====It is traditionally assumed that demand is uncertain, but can be characterized as a stochastic process (See Talluri and van Ryzin (2005) for a review of the ==== models). In practice, however, airlines have limited demand information and are unable to fully characterize demand stochastic processes. Robust optimization methods have been proposed to overcome this modeling challenge. Under robust optimization framework, demand is only assumed to lie within a polyhedral uncertainty set (Lan et al. (2008); Perakis and Roels (2010)).====In this paper, we consider the multi-fare, network revenue management problem for the case demand information is limited (i.e. the only information available is lower/upper bounds on demand). Under this interval uncertainty, we characterize the robust optimal booking limit policy by use of minimax regret criterion. We present an LP (Linear Programming) solvable mathematical program for the maximum regret so our model is able to solve large-scale problems for practical use. A genetic algorithm is proposed to find the booking limit control to minimize the maximum regret. We provide computational experiments and compare our methods to existing ones. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our robust approach.","The objective of revenue management is to maximize the revenue or yield of the firm. A revenue management system will help firms decide how much of each type of capacity to allocate to different types of demand. Especially, in the airline industry, the revenue management guides the decision of how to allocate undifferentiated units of capacity to available demand in such a way as to maximize profit or revenue. The airlines would prefer filling their planes with higher-fare customers, but since demand uncertainty presents in the market, they try filling their planes with lower-fare customers to avoid opportunity costs incurred by empty seats. The airlines must decide how many lower-fares to sell while at the same time making sure they have enough seats left to sell to higher-fare passengers.====The key thing to face with such a problem is how to deal with demand uncertainty. Traditional revenue management models assume that demand is unknown but can be represented by a probability distribution. Further, several traditional analyses rely on unrealistic assumptions about demand such as independence and stationarity. Even if there are several sophisticated demand forecasting methods, demand is hard to fully characterize as a distribution especially in the airline industry which deviates by a variety of reasons (e.g., limited demand information, various customer segments, customers strategic behavior, unobservable lost sales, etc.). Robust approach which only relies on limited demand information can be an answer of this modeling challenge.====In this paper, we consider the network revenue management problem and provide alternative forms of controlling the booking limits when demand information is limited. By adopting the minimax regret criteria, we develop an optimal booking limit policy for the cases where the only information available is lower/upper bounds on demand. In many cases, lower and upper bounds on demand are easier to obtain than a probability distribution. More importantly, it is much simpler to update those bounds of information rather than distribution and probability information when we account seasonality in demand which has significant impact in service industries including airlines. Through simple modification of those bounds, our model is expected to provide optimal booking limit policies according to seasonal highs and lows.====Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We formulate the minimax regret problem which does not require the capacity constraints for booking limits so that we do not partition capacity into buckets. Through some propositions we prove, our maximum regret formulation can be transformed as an LP solvable problem. Then, by use of genetic algorithm, we provide the booking limit control to minimize the maximum regret. Numerical experiments demonstrate the solution quality of our robust control.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We provide a literature review in Section 2.

It is shown that LASSO generally outperforms the other approaches in this study. We concluded a number of findings on the oil price and other influential factors on Chinese airline profitability.","Oil prices and exchange rate fluctuations can be very large, and the performance of the air transport industry is highly sensitive to both of these. So, what is the impact of oil prices and exchange rate on Chinese airlines’ profitability? Can the characteristics of fluctuations in oil prices and exchange rate over time be combined with other influencing factors to predict the short, and medium-term, profits of airlines? Can a forecasting method be found for airline managers and institutional investors such as insurance or social security funds? In this article we use and compare some very modern statistical computational methodologies to solve the problems we describe here.====As an important branch of the transportation industry, the air transportation industry has developed rapidly in recent years. Its development reflects the level of national economic and social modernization around the world. Airline companies in China mainly provide passenger, freight and postal services to China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as well as services with partner international airlines. By the end of 2018, China's civil air transport volume had reached 612 million passengers, up 10.9% over the previous year. The total transport turnover reached 120.653 billion ton-km, up 11.4% over the previous year (data source: 2018 civil aviation industry development statistical bulletin).====With the gradual globalization of the world economy, on one hand, the improvement of the global supply chain will certainly expand the demand for air transport and drive the sustained and rapid development of the air transport industry. On the other hand, with the gradual widening of China's civil aviation transportation market, the competition among airlines in various aspects such as scale, price and service is strong, making it harder for airlines to remain profitable and survive in the market.====In recent years, the popularity of China's high-speed rail network has grown, and there have been improvements in the highway network between cities. In this way, railway and road transportation, which has a relatively lower cost advantage, has also formed a competitive pressure on the aviation transportation industry. The air transport industry itself is also greatly affected by other factors in the external environment: terrorist attacks, natural disasters, strikes and unexpected public health events will affect the normal operation of airlines, thus affecting the companies' performance and long-term development.====More accurate prediction of the airlines' performance, based on easily recorded known influential factors, is therefore potentially very important as a means to mitigate impacts from those external factors that can be predicted. Based on reliable predictions, the airlines might more effectively adjust their company's development strategy, use pricing contracts such as fuel hedging as part of their risk management plans, and adjust fares and purchasing plans, among other things. For investors, more insights into the airlines' performance might impact on investment choices in that type of business.====This paper will consider quarterly profit data collected on the three largest airlines in China as research samples, along with other external data sources, to train and test profit forecast models. These can provide practical guidance to decision-makers and investors. China's three largest carriers, usually referred to as the “big three”, are Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines.====Air China was formally established in Beijing in 1988 as the main air transport company controlled by the China national aviation corporation. Air China has the most developed route network and the largest annual passenger volume.====Founded in 1995, China Southern Airlines, headquartered in Guangzhou, is the largest carrier in China with the largest number of transport aircraft.====China Eastern Airlines is a state-owned holding airline headquartered in Shanghai, China. Based on the former China Eastern Airlines group, China Eastern Airlines merged China northwest Airlines with China Yunnan Airlines. It is the first Chinese civil aviation airline listed in Hong Kong, New York and Shanghai.====Since their inception, the “big three” airlines have continued to grow in financial and operational scale, showing great momentum to become the leading international aviation market. As of 2018, China's “big three” aircraft fleet is only second to the five big airlines in the United States in size. In recent years, it has been rising in terms of revenue, mileage and passenger volume. From the perspective of scale and influence, the three major airlines are taken as samples, which we expect provide a good indicator of the current trends in the overall air transportation market in China.====The existing research on airline performance is generally limited to looking for the operating and macro reasons that affect performance; this is also the case in the mainstream forecasting literature in general, see e.g. Li (2014) and Verstraete and Aghezzaf (2020). This article differs from the majority of the mainstream literature in that we establish a multi-factor prediction model based on multiple external influencing factors.====Because we can form the airline profit modelling problem as the solution to a statistical model that involves the traditional time series autoregressive distributed lag model with a large number of predictors, we propose that the LASSO is one of the most suitable approaches for this problem. The LASSO of Tibshirani (1996) is a modern alternative to the ordinary least squares regression approach (Birkes and Dodge, 1993). The LASSO approach is preferable when there are a large number of predictors which also might be highly correlated with one another; ordinary least squares approaches can be unreliable in such settings.====The remainder of this article is organised as follows.

Due to their flexible mobility patterns and automated operational characteristics, flying taxi and shared flying car services are expected to expand the existing shared mobility services (such as Uber, Lyft, and similar services) of the urban transportation network. Despite their forthcoming introduction in the shared mobility market, public perceptions and expectations about these services have not been investigated in travel demand literature. This study aims to provide an ==== of public willingness to hire and pay for flying taxis and shared flying car services, and to identify the determinants of the willingness to hire and pay for such services. Using data collected from an online survey, individuals' willingness to hire and to pay for flying taxi and shared flying car services are statistically modeled within a correlated grouped random parameters bivariate probit framework. The analysis shows that various socio-demographic characteristics and individuals’ opinions towards the perceived benefits and challenges of flying cars affect public willingness to hire and pay for flying taxi and shared flying car services. Even though the awareness about the operation of flying taxis and shared flying car services is possibly limited in the public sphere, the findings of this study can provide insights into the challenges that policymakers, manufacturing companies, and shared mobility providers will face with the introduction of such flying car services in the transportation networks.","Over the last decades, the worldwide demand for automobiles has risen steadily, either for passenger or goods transportation. Despite their growing capacities, the transportation infrastructure systems remain in constant need for expansion in order to accommodate increasing traffic volumes as well as to address passengers' demand for low and reliable travel times, enhanced safety and security and straightforward access to different transportation modes. To that end, recent technological advancements have paved the way for the introduction of innovative transportation technologies and systems such as electric vehicles, carpooling systems and autonomous or intelligent transportation systems. Earlier research has attempted to identify the consumers' perception patterns towards the acceptance of electric vehicles and possible benefits and infrastructure requirements (Egbue and Long, 2012; Tamor et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2015; Rezvani et al., 2018). Carsharing schemes provide flexible and accessible mobility patterns and have significant potential in alleviating urban traffic congestion (Shaheen et al., 2006; Habib et al., 2012; Budd, 2016). In the last decade, automotive industry has been leaning towards the introduction of autonomous vehicles, which, in turn, led to an abundance of studies exploring public perceptions, opinions and possible transformations of travel behavior (Rödel et al., 2014; Choi and Ji, 2015; Kyriakidis et al., 2015; Bansal et al., 2016; Ellis et al., 2016; Nordhoff et al., 2016; Fu and Kim, 2016; Becker and Axhausen, 2017; Xu et al., 2018). Special consideration has been also given to the joint implementation of carsharing schemes and autonomous technologies through the operation of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Previous studies (Zhang et al., 2015; Krueger et al., 2016) have investigated individuals’ expectations regarding the travel time, waiting time, travel cost characteristics of the shared autonomous vehicles.====As a result of the recent technological advancements, a newly emerging transportation mode, namely the flying cars, are expected to join the traffic fleet. Based on recent developments and announcements, availability of flying cars in the automotive market is expected to take place between 2020 and 2025 (Becker, 2017; Oppitz and Tomsu, 2018). Several start-up companies, which have developed flying car prototypes, currently focus on accelerating the introduction of flying cars into the traffic fleet (to name a few, Terrafugia, AeroMobil, Kitty Hawk and Opener). Opener, one of the latest contenders in flying car development, has recently demonstrated their prototype, which combines near-vertical take-off and landing capabilities. In a collaborative effort, Audi and Airbus have developed and presented a modular flying taxi concept named “Pop.Up Next”, which consists of a flight module, a passenger capsule and an autonomous ground module (Audi and Italdesign, 2018). NASA is collaborating with Uber to establish a new ridership framework (referred to as “urban air mobility”) for densely populated metropolitan areas, assess possible impacts of small aircrafts on such areas as well as identify challenges and appropriate countermeasures related to air traffic control system (NASA, 2018a; NASA, 2018b). Several other companies have announced their willingness to invest in designing and manufacturing flying cars, such as, Airbus, Volocopter and EHang (Shamiyeh et al., 2017). Despite the growing interest in this emerging technology, the adoption of flying cars by the commuting population, in terms of the anticipated level of ownership or use, remains uncertain. Even though the expected acquaintance cost of flying cars may constitute a possible adoption barrier, their flexible operation as well as their multiple-passenger capacity (they can accommodate two to four passengers) pave the way for flying taxis or new shared mobility services based on flying cars.====The aim of this study is to identify the key factors that may affect individuals' willingness to hire and willingness to pay for flying taxis and shared flying car services. In line with previous studies focusing on travelers' perceptions (Greghi et al., 2013; Molin et al., 2017; Zimmermann et al., 2018) a survey is designed and distributed in order to extract opinions and preferences pertaining to flying cars and flying taxis along with the socio-demographic and behavioral background of the respondents. Survey data are used for the joint statistical analysis of individuals' willingness to hire and willingness to pay for flying taxi and shared services. To account for significant modeling issues arising from possible systematic unobserved variations among the survey responses (specifically, unobserved heterogeneity, unbalanced panel effects, cross-equation error term correlation and correlation among the unobserved effects), the correlated grouped random parameters bivariate probit modeling framework is employed. The results of the analysis show that individuals' willingness to hire and willingness to pay for flying taxi services are affected by various socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics as well as individuals’ perceptions regarding the perceived concerns and benefits of flying cars.",An exploratory empirical analysis of willingness to hire and pay for flying taxis and shared flying car services,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305469,12 November 2020,2020,Research Article,264.0

It was the first time ever that the industry generated a return on investment greater than the cost of capital (IATA, 2017). In real terms, airlines made $35.3 billion net profit on revenues of $718 billion or a return of 4.8%. These two developments highlight the growing importance of ancillary revenues for airlines worldwide. With base fares in free fall in real terms, the industry increasingly has had to rely on the sale of supplementary services to compensate.

The SEAM has led to benefits for passengers and for many local economies. However, the claim that liberalisation has also been good for labour is one that is contradicted by the deterioration of aircrews' terms and conditions of employment and the erosion of workers’ ability to defend contractual terms and professional standards.","Liberalisation of civil aviation in Europe – the creation of a Single European Aviation Market (SEAM) – opened the market to new (low cost) aviation businesses. It generated a new passenger market with more people flying to more destinations at much lower ticket prices. European airline traffic grew by 3 per cent per annum between 1995 and 2013 (Juul, 2016: 2) with 918 million passengers flying in 2015 compared to 360 million 1993.==== Whereas the lowest cost of a flight between Paris and Milan was €400 in 1992, the price had fallen to just €25 in 2017.==== Liberalisation also created greater employment opportunities and one might expect competition for labour in a service-oriented industry to create pressure on employers to treat employees well in order to attract and retain staff. Contrariwise, it is well established in airline economics that labour is a crucial ‘factor of production’, commonly representing around one third of total operating costs for airlines and sometimes as much as two thirds for ground handling services providers (GSPs). Consequently, labour is the key to ‘cost effective’ operations (Doganis 2006) and, in the face of more intense competition in the product market, the terms and conditions of most aircrew in the labour market are now very different from those that existed prior to liberalisation. Simply put, liberalisation has sharpened (cost) competition between airlines to the benefit of passengers and local economies whereas any benefits for the workforce, such as the quantity of new opportunities, are outweighed by a deterioration in the terms and conditions of many aircrew.====In this paper we challenge the claims of the European Commission (Directorate General for Mobility and Transport) and other organisations (e.g. the UK's Civil Aviation Authority CAA) that liberalisation has brought ‘benefits for all’. In the following section we briefly summarise some of the key changes to aviation workers' terms and conditions of employment, initiated primarily by the low-cost airlines and increasingly emulated by several legacy airlines. Our examples focus specifically on British and Irish airlines, the home of Europe's leading low-cost airlines (easyJet and Ryanair respectively). The fact that these airlines are licenced in liberal market economies is no coincidence, as there are fewer constraints on strategic managerial choice in the UK and Ireland (Hall and Soskice, 2001). As a result, the impact of liberalisation on aviation workers has been more keenly felt, although the strategic actions of these airlines extends right across Europe, not only in terms of their own operational and employment policies but the impact on rival airlines, many of whom have ‘followed suit’. British Airways (BA), now a profitable member of International Airline Group, is arguably a case in point, having pioneered a series of labour cost-cutting responses to liberalisation.====The idea that liberalisation has been good for civil aviation workers is based on the premise of a tighter labour market that ‘empowers’ workers, both as individuals with more choice and via collective action. The fallacy of this argument is demonstrated in a subsequent section where we consider the structural and associational power of labour. The way liberalisation has played out in the labour market has served to weaken, rather than augment, workers' bargaining power, creating seemingly irresistible downward pressure on job security and the terms and conditions of aircrew. A pattern has emerged of constant (labour) cost-competition reinforced by periodic crises that have rocked the aviation industry since 2001, hastening what many regard as a ‘race-to-the-bottom’ for workers' terms and conditions of employment. In the final section we note how this pattern has been repeated during the current global pandemic.

The proposed Multiple-criteria Dynamic Stand Allocation (MDSA) method uses fuzzy logic to support decision-making under uncertainty. The MDSA method provides effective solutions in a short time, necessary for traffic management in case of delays, emergency, and untypical cases. It considers partially conflicting points of view of different airport users (airport managers, air traffic controllers, airlines, handling agents, and passengers) and may significantly support managers on the SA problem. The approach proposed can also be used for creating an initial SA plan for a considerable number of aircraft.","Aircraft stand allocation (SA) is an ordinary task of air traffic management. In most cases, airport infrastructure is designed redundantly, and service capability exceeds average traffic volume, so SA is not a critical task. However, during peak hours or in case of failures or disturbances, proper SA is crucial for airport functioning. At any time, SA can impact the financial performance of an airport or an airline and on the airport perception by the users.====A stand allocation problem (SAP) can be defined formally as an optimization task. There are many papers, presented briefly in Section 1.1, where different optimization criteria were identified. Most of them are considered from the airport managers (AM) point of view as they are responsible for preparing the SA plan. However, there are many different airport users for whom SA is also essential – air traffic control services (ATC), air carriers (AC), handling agents (HA), and finally, passengers (PAX). Optimization criteria and constraints of the optimization task could be different depending on their perspective. Besides, creating optimal allocation plans is not enough to achieve satisfactory results in practice. There are numerous disruptions that prevent the realization of the assumed allocation plan. Dynamic management is required. It can be adequately supported by the proposed method.====The word “dynamic” can be understood in several ways. In our concept, “dynamic management” means finding an answer to a decision problem in conditions other than usual, dynamically changing. Additionally, the decision-maker learns of the change in these conditions late, i.e., the time to react is short. This is precisely the case when it is necessary to reallocate an aircraft to a stand after an operational disruption when the initial stand allocation plan cannot be executed.====In this paper, we have addressed the problem of multiple-criteria analysis of possible SA options, which will consider to some extent, the interests of all airport users. The idea of the paper is that we should look for solutions that maximize the overall utility of the SA for all airport users.",Dynamic management of aircraft stand allocation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305470,4 November 2020,2020,Research Article,268.0

We compared the effects of the extension of the HSR network and the entry of LCCs on the airfares of the incumbent Full Service Carriers (FSC). We conducted ==== analysis with passenger level data to evaluate these market changes, and found that the effects of the HSR extension on FSC's airfares were consistently negative and larger in the short haul markets, while the effects of the entry of LCCs were inconsistent. HSR seems to be a stronger competitor than LCC to FSC and this finding could be affected by capacity, which is large for HSR while small for the LCCs.","Both High Speed Rail (HSR) and Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) could be rivals to traditional Full Service Carriers (FSCs). Japan has a long history of competition between HSR and air transport that started in 1964 when HSR (Shinkansen) was opened on the 553 km Tokaido route between Tokyo and Osaka. Since that time, the total HSR network has been extended to 3000 km. As a result, many competitive air routes faced great losses of passengers and some of the routes were abandoned. On the other hand, the history of competition between LCC and FSC is brief as pure LCCs had not emerged into the domestic air market in Japan until 2012. As shown in Table 1, HSR on the Kyushu route and the Hokuriku route extended in 2011 and 2015, respectively, and two pure LCCs, Peach Aviation (APJ) and Jetstar Japan (JJP) entered into some domestic air routes in 2012.

It offers a systematic and interactive perspective by simultaneously providing the perspective of both airline managers and passengers by using a new hybrid method, namely Fuzzy Importance, Expected Performance, and Priority Analysis (FIEPA) with ====. This method allows the use of different perspectives of different managers in the analysis, which can be prioritized with different weights. According to the results of the study, in which 449 passengers participated on Twitter, the attributes on which airline managers should focus were determined, having three distinctive characteristics of being important for customers, having high priority according managers, and having low expected performance according customers. Twenty-two attributes related to the service quality of airlines during outbreak periods were classified into three main dimensions as “social distance and hygiene during flight”, “information awareness and concern”, and “infection alert procedure”.","In service industries, the improvement of service quality constitutes the most important element for a competitive advantage in the global market (Harrington and Akehurst, 1996). Accurate and timely measurement of customer needs and expectations is very critical for identification of the most important and crucial service dimensions, the improvement of service quality, and the establishment of a strong competitive advantage on the market and efficient and effective distribution of resources (Lin et al., 2011; Pakdil et al., 2012). Similarly, in the airline industry, where there is intense and tough competition, airline companies accurately determine and focus on the most important needs and expectations of their customers and continuously improve service quality and customer satisfaction so that they can gain new customers without losing their current ones (Ali et al., 2015; Boetsch et al., 2011; Butler and Keller, 1992; Chow, 2015; Mousavi and Bossink, 2020). Airline managers are also expected to maintain optimal resource allocation so that they can control their costs and meet the customer's most important needs accurately and punctually (Tahanisaz and Shokuhyar, 2020). As customers are the sole judges of service quality, the quality of service is basically measured from the customer's point of view (de Oña et al., 2012; Zeithaml et al., 1990). However, the conceptualization of service quality will create a more realistic, effective, and efficient method, taking into account both the customer's voice and the organizational capacities and priorities of the business at the same time.====In the literature, studies on measuring airline service quality by evaluating the expectations and perceptions of passengers are frequently encountered (Chou et al., 2011; Farooq et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2020). However, with the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seen in more than 209 countries and overseas territories or communities since December 2019, the airline sector has suffered its heaviest blow ever with parked aircraft as the pandemic has left its mark on the airline service quality cycle (Harrell, 2020; OECD, 2020). In this context, there is no study assessing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on passengers' perceptions of service quality during the outbreak. In the related literature on the airline sector, only one study has been found measuring passengers’ perceptions of preventive measures against influenza (H1N1) (Chou and Lu, 2011).====This study aims to reveal how to improve and define the issues of service quality in the airline sector after the COVID-19 outbreak, to what extent customer needs (important issues) and expectations (expected performances) will differ, and the priorities of airline sector managers in terms of resource allocation, costs, planned strategies, and operational efficiency and effectiveness. It offers a systematic and interactive perspective by simultaneously providing the perspectives of both airline managers and passengers.====In this study, a new method has been developed by improving the Fuzzy Importance- Performance-Impact Analysis (FIPIA) hybrid method developed by Atalay et al. (2019). With this method, using a fuzzy scale helps combatting the nature of fuzzy and abstract (de Oña et al., 2013), the uncertainty, ambiguity, vagueness, impreciseness, and subjectivity in service activities are reduced. Perceived performance defines the actual performance according to customers' perceptions, while expected performance expresses the customers’ expectations for the performance of the business (Kang, 2006; Lu et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2000). In this study, due to the nature of the outbreak, expected performance has been preferred instead of perceived performance. The relative priority dimension is defined instead of the impact dimension in the IPIA method, unlike FIPIA, and the weighted views of multiple decision makers are included in the service quality components. Thus, because of the priorities of the managers of different units that may change, decision-maker bias can also be prevented.====In the present paper, Section 2 addresses service quality in the airline sector after COVID-19, while Section 3 explains Fuzzy Importance, Expected Performance, and Priority Analysis (FIEPA) with VIKOR. Section 4 presents the hybrid method of FIEPA with VIKOR. Section 5 provides a case study and Section 6 consists of a discussion of the findings and conclusions.

Our model extends the conventional bilateral customer-supplier relationship perspective of customer portfolio management to include competition effects for more comprehensive (trilateral) strategic decision making. Based on this unified framework, our a survey of 180 customers of air cargo express carriers identifies three distinctive groups of preferred customers. In addition to the effect of competitors on air express carriers’ prioritization of customers, which is further complicated by a satisfaction paradox and spurious loyalty, we further establish classification indicators for differentiating preferred from non-preferred customers. Notably, although commonly used in practice, we find ==== to be ineffective for that purpose.","As competition becomes increasingly fierce, businesses gradually shift their focus from market share to customer share to attain sustainable competitiveness (Johnson and Selnes 2004). Customer portfolio management (CPM) entails segmenting customers into portfolios to derive a relatively clear understanding of the importance constituted by each customer relative to total profits and sales. This process assists companies in determining preferred customers to extend their customer bases through relationship development (Ross et al., 2010). As such, CPM is an important tool used for business (Zolkiewski and Turnbull 2002) and has long drawn practitioners' and academics' attention (Corsaro et al., 2013). However, despite researchers and practitioners paying considerable attention to customer portfolio models, the performance levels of such models remain disputed (Homburg et al., 2009). The criticism for the majority of CPM models is that they approach value from a financial perspective only rather than broadly considering customer value/behavior (Thakur and Workman 2016). In addition, as a business relationship involves a buyer and seller, portfolio approaches are argued to not combine these two perspectives (Ritter and Andersen 2014). A portfolio model typically incorporates supplier viewpoints but does not account for customer perspectives. Conversely, research executed on relationship marketing or supplier management only considers customer perspectives and involves the assumption that suppliers possess the willingness to conform to the requirements of customers (Ramsay and Wagner 2009). A research gap, therefore, exists in between CPM and relationship marketing. More importantly, in the absence of customer perspectives, competitor effects are often neglected in customer portfolios. We argue that competition is prevalent in the air cargo industry which severely moderates suppliers’ relational effects. Although Porter suggested that a portfolio model should include supplier, customers, as well as competitors (Olsen and Ellram 1997), such practices are still underdeveloped in academic work.====Empirically, a customer portfolio is often explored in manufacturing contexts and is suggested to extend to service sectors (Hüttinger et al., 2012). Services are different from manufacturing in terms of property. Service products involve customers and are inherently flexible, invisible, perishable, and inseparable. In service classifications, transportation is categorized as a service factory that produces tangible outcome, termed as number of passengers’ trips or tonnages carried (Verma 2000). Transportation is vital for businesses as well as private individuals. Since transportation usually involves a considerable number of customers, it requires customer insights for effective resource allocations, which is even more relevant in Business to Business (B2B) markets suppliers rely on fewer but larger and hence more important industrial customers. However, as per our review of the extant literature, no such CPM practice exists for mass service markets, and relevant analytical models are still lacking.====Thus, the current study draws on social exchange theory (SET) and push–pull–mooring (PPM) theory—conceived for explaining people's migration—to develop a taxonomy-based preferred-customer model for suppliers in B2B air express service markets. SET is based on supplier/customer bilateral perspectives to justify relationship in a designated cycle that first involves perceiving, then assessing, and finally comparing the attractiveness of mutual and alternative parties. In SET, attractiveness is a future-oriented concept that can be employed to measure the potential value of a relationship in the portfolio approach (Ritter and Andersen 2014). Nonetheless, supply chain management and industrial marketing systems have yet to simultaneously incorporate into their analyses customers', suppliers', and competitors' attractiveness (Hüttinger et al., 2012).====In essence, transportation services require heavy investment in facilities and equipment that generate a considerably large service capacity, engendering a scale economy but also expose them to significant financial risks due to the inherent volatilities of this industry (e.g. Merkert and Swidan, 2019). As a result, service usage must be considered to ensure economic efficiency and commercial viability for transportation systems. That is, from a transportation supplier viewpoint, customers exhibiting long-lasting repetitive usage contributing to the supplier's profit function; therefore, repetitive usage may serve as a determinant of customer attractiveness to the supplier. Customers' repetitive usage is termed as behavioral loyalty that is often regarded as a firm's key asset. To structure the extent to which transportation customers are loyal to a supplier, we apply PPM theory that considers both customer and supplier perspectives under the influences of competitors. A preferred-customer model is accordingly developed as a key aim of this paper using a taxonomy-based approach to express the distributions of classified customers.====CPM applications are scarce (Cui 2013), and portfolio models lack empirical evidence in B2B service markets. As such, the second key aim of this paper is to deploy our taxonomy-based CPM approach to a transportation B2B context involving air express services provided to manufacturer customers. This context is chosen because in our view, compared to other markets, competition effects can be more effectively examined in the oligopolistic market constituted by the four well-known air express companies, namely FedEx, DHL, UPS, and TNT (please note that FedEx and TNT have merged since then).====While identifying preferred customers has become a must issue for transport practitioners, the academic literature in this field is still sparse. This study bridges the theoretical gap by developing a unified quantitative framework that integrates SET and PPM to include competition effects. The issue of preferred customer status is thus extended to calibrate trilateral effects rather than conventional bilateral effects to obtain more comprehensive recommendation for strategic management. In addition, as studies on suppliers’ preferred customers are still sparse in the service sector, we contribute by providing evidence from the air transport express industry. While our focus is on air cargo express services and B2B relationships, our findings may change the mindset of managers in transport and other service industries more generally as they provide guidance on how to better identify preferred customers and safeguard precious company resources.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the findings of our literature review and develop our taxonomy-based model. In Section 3, we describe the context and method of our B2B air express customer survey. Section 4 provides an analysis of the obtained customer data and a detailed examination of the variables that allowed us to classify customer groups and ultimately identify preferred customers of air express companies. In Section 5, we discuss the findings, draw relevant conclusions including limitations of our analysis and provide recommendations for further research.",Towards a taxonomy-based preferred-customer model for suppliers in air cargo express service markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305457,28 October 2020,2020,Research Article,271.0

Nonhub airports surrounding large hub airports with higher passenger enplanements and higher average yields also have higher yields than other nonhub airports. In addition, this study finds the effect of Allegiant Airlines in lowering the average passenger yield of the nonhub airports served directly by the airline, which can be termed as ‘Allegiant Effect’. Findings of this study could provide valuable guidance for airlines to analyze network planning strategies and to identify future markets for growth and for policymakers when allocating resources to communities relying on these nonhub airports.","Passenger yield, or simply yield, is a frequently used metric in the airline industry. Calculated by dividing passenger revenue with revenue passenger miles (RPMs), yield measures the unit airfare paid by each passenger for each mile of flying. Simply put, yield is average airfare standardized by route length.====Yield can be reported for a specific route, airport, airline, or the entire air transportation network of a region. For airlines, yield is a useful indicator of how profitable a market is when coupled with other measures such as load factors. For travelers, yield fairly reflects how expensive, or inexpensive air travel actually is when itineraries of different route lengths are being compared. And for airports, yield determines the attractiveness of different connecting options to passengers and airlines.====In a deregulated aviation market, airlines in theory have the ultimate authority to price their own airfares. However, given the dynamic and oligopolistic nature of the industry and routes, an airline's pricing power is bounded by multiple exogenous factors such as competition and network structure (Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, a thorough understanding of these external factors and their effects is of great interest to both airlines and researchers, and can provide guidance for airlines to efficiently deploy resources and to optimally price airfares.====When average passenger yield is organized by origin airports for different routes, the pattern is apparent. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 illustrate the pattern of yield variation across hub categories, passenger enplanements, and geographic locations. It is evident that larger airports tend to have lower average passenger yields than smaller airports and passenger yields of smaller airports display a certain spatial pattern. Existing studies have addressed the impact of these factors on passenger yield or cost of air travel from different perspectives, but they disproportionally focus on either large hub airports or routes connecting such airports. Very few studies have been done to smaller airports which are vital to regional towns and communities. To fill the gap in the known research, this study is motivated to explore passenger yield variations of nonhub airports and, more importantly, to identify factors causing such variations.====The structure of the remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant literature that addresses airfare, cost of air travel, or passenger yield variations at different levels. Section 3 provides an overview of the research setting and then focuses on model specification. Results of key diagnostic tests, model estimation and comparisons are presented in Section 4.

The paper formally defines an abstract model of ontology-based information filtering and the structure of semantic containers, their composition, versioning, discovery, and replicated physical allocation. The paper further discusses different usage scenarios, the role of semantic containers in SWIM, an architecture for a semantic container management system, as well as a proof-of-concept prototype. Finally the paper discusses a blockchain-based notary service to realize tamper-proof version histories for semantic containers.","Providers of air traffic management (ATM) information increasingly employ standardized information exchange models for the publication of ATM information. The Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) (Aeronautical Information, 2016), the Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) (Flight Information, 2017), and the ICAO Weather Information Exchange Model (IWXXM) (Weather Information, 2017) are the most common examples of exchange models in ATM. Different information providers publish different types of information items, e.g., Digital NOTAMs, flight plans, or weather reports, on the SWIM network, which relies on the standardized exchange models. The SWIM network provides information consumers with a uniform technical basis for accessing the various types of ATM information published by a multitude of information providers.====A consumer of ATM information, e.g., an aircraft pilot or an air traffic controller, typically requires only a small fraction of the available information in order to prepare for a task. Providing ATM information packages, i.e., collections of relevant ATM information, encompasses retrieving all the required information by making calls to various services offered by different information providers. In order to reduce the information load, filter conditions may be sent along with the requests for information directly to the service providers. Alternatively, dedicated filtering services or end-user applications may assume the filtering task. The complexity of the filtering task, in turn, may vary, from rather simple to more complex; Digital NOTAM (DNOTAM) filtering (Burgstaller et al., 2016) is a prime example of a complex and computationally expensive filtering task.====The overall goal of the research presented in this paper is to facilitate the provisioning and management of ATM information packages. The challenges we tackle are the following. (i) Dealing with many different service interfaces from different information providers without standardized means to specify filter criteria makes the collection of relevant information cumbersome. (ii) Information filtering is often computationally expensive and conducting the information filtering from scratch for every information need is highly inefficient. (iii) New information items must be integrated over time to keep ATM information packages up-to-date. For later auditability it is necessary to keep track of every update and its provenance. (iv) Network or service outages may hamper availability.====Solving these challenges is necessary for the scalable provision of ATM information packages which we believe will play a central and ubiquitous role in the future SWIM network where ATM information will be provided and filtered at large-scale.====The ==== presented in this paper is a platform-independent, ontology-based approach for the provision and management of ATM information packages – the Semantic Container approach developed in project BEST (Vennesland and Gorman, 2018). A semantic container, the central construct of the approach, represents an information need or information package, and is described by type and origin of information together with filter criteria.====The Semantic Container approach tackles the aforementioned challenges as follows (using the same numbering as above): (i) Information needs and information packages are uniformly represented by semantic containers with filter criteria defined in shared ontologies to ensure a common understanding between ATM stakeholders and allowing to abstract away from particular service calls. (ii) Pre-filtered information packages can be re-used for the derivation of task-specific information packages. The description of semantic containers facilitates automated discovery of pre-filtered information packages as well as the dynamic addition and removal from a derivation chain of semantic containers. (iii) A semantic container maintains a version history to verify which information was available to the user at a particular point of time and to track the provenance of each update. (iv) Replication of information packages increases availability in case of network or service outages.====This paper is a revised and extended version of a conference paper (Gringinger et al., 2018). The main additional contributions of this paper are ==== of an abstract model of ATM information, of ontology-aware information filtering, and of the main constructs of the Semantic Container approach. The formal definitions precisely describe the Semantic Container approach and the basics upon which it builds, avoiding the ambiguities of the previously mainly textual presentation of the approach. Additionally we describe a notary service that provides trusted timestamps, thus enabling trusted version histories of semantic containers, allowing, especially in case of incidents, to verify ==== the contents of a semantic container at a particular location at a certain point of time in the past.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sect. 2 explains the development of OWL ontologies from widely-used, standardized ATM information exchange models which serve as basis for ontology-based ATM information filtering. Sect. 3 introduces an abstract and formal model of ATM information and of ontology-based ATM information filtering which underly the Semantic Container approach. Sect. 4 introduces a formal model of the Semantic Container approach, describing the core constructs of the approach in a precise and implementation-independent manner.

We employ flexible parametric choice methods (mixed logit) in order to test the effect of standard attributes on the choice probability. In addition we extend existing literature with the introduction of parking charges in the choice experiment. Our results show a significant and negative impact of parking charges on airport choice probability. Thus, we can compute high elasticities of parking charges for tourists. These results suggest, that airport managers have in form of parking policies a powerful policy instrument as they can directly affect the size of the airport catchment area.","In past years, non-aeronautical revenues advanced to an important source of income for airports. According to Graham (2009) the share of non-aeronautical revenues is estimated to around 50 percent of total revenues. One significant part of airport commercial revenues comes from parking charges. For 2006 Graham (2009) reports that around one fifth of airport commercial revenues are coming from parking space management. In North America, this share amounts to almost one third. In addition, according to unofficial statements by German airport officials and following the long-term trend these figures have become, most likely, higher in the meanwhile. Nowadays, airport revenues out of parking charges account (for a medium size airport in Germany) for around one quarter of the total commercial airport revenues. As a result, airports currently invest a lot in their parking spaces and employ extensively parking management systems. Usually airports differentiate their parking charges according to the parking time (short vs. long-termed passengers) with the aim of segmenting the market between business and leisure passengers.====Charging for parking spaces may (however) have multiple effects. First, parking charges may influence the drivers' choice of parking location (Tsamboulas, 2001; Hensher and King, 2001; Gillen, 1978; Madsen et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2017). Higher parking charges at airports may therefore lead passengers to park their cars far away from the airport. Second, parking charges may affect the individual mode choice (Willson, 1992; Albert and Mahalel, 2006; Simicevic et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2017; Evangelinos et al., 2018). Higher airport parking charges may thus lead passengers to use another transport mode to the airport. Third, parking charges at airports may affect the overall passengers' choice of the airport. This may be of particular interest for multi-airport areas. However, since passengers do not only choose the airport but also the airline, parking charges might influence the combined airline-airport choice. Thus, airports and airlines compete for passengers in multi-airport areas ==== when setting parking charges. Analyzing the impact of parking charges on the passenger's individual airline/airport choice behavior is in particular interesting for tourists. Tourists in many cases have limited opportunities to choose a remote parking location, since they may carry a lot of luggage with them, which makes the last part of the trip (after parking) very inconvenient. The same reasoning also holds for mode choices. Tourists travel in many cases not alone to the airport but rather with their family (including children), which makes the use of public transit systems to reach the airport very difficult.==== In multi-airport areas, however, pricing for parking spaces at airports will possibly also affect passengers' airport choice. Since tourists park their cars at airports for longer periods than business passengers, parking costs represent, in many cases, a significant part of their budget and thus they may consider this in their decision, when scheduling their holidays.====Airport choice depends also on other characteristics, such as: access distance to the airport, flight costs, direct fly, duration, etc., which considered together from a traveler's perspective determine the attractiveness of each airport within a given multi-airport region. In other words, one can say that there is a strong relationship between airport characteristics, its relative attractiveness and, ultimately, its catchment areas.====This paper investigates the third effect. We study the impact of airport parking fees on the individual airline/airport choice of tourists. Existing research has already addressed the general topic of airline/airport choices, using choice modelling approaches (Harvey, 1987; Hess and Polak, 2005, 2006; Hess et al., 2007; Ischii et al., 2009; Young and Yoo, 2014; Lieshout, 2012; Yang et al., 2014; Suzuki, 2007; Pels et al. 2001, 2003). In general, these studies show that fares, flight frequency, departure time, inertia and direct flights are important factors affecting the passenger's airline/airport choice decision. However, parking fees at airports have not been explicitly analyzed in such approaches up to now, where costs for parking are rather parts of the generalized trip cost of passengers, with the only exception being Qin et al. (2017). This last paper analyzes travelers' parking choice preferences for the off-site airport parking activities at Beijing Capital International Airport whereas in our case the focus is linked to the implications this might have on overall airport attractiveness, thus on airport choice in a multi-airport region which, at the end of the day, translates into the catchment area dimension.====In particular, this paper tests explicitly the effect of parking charges on the airline/airport choice behavior of tourists. That is, we apply our models for cases where passengers park their cars at airports for longer time periods. Since tourists represent a considerable part of air traffic demand, they represent an interesting source of additional revenues for airports.====Using orthogonal design surveying methods, we develop a choice experiment and collect data for summer tourists in Saxony, Germany. In addition, we employ flexible modelling approaches (mixed logit). Such approaches have rarely been used up to now in literature.====All our modeling efforts are aimed to provide relevant and robust information to the airport managers who are capable of modifying any of the attributes/levels characterizing a given airport.====The paper is structured as follows: After the introduction, section two provides a short literature review and gives the main modeling approaches. Section three describes the modelling approach, the used data and presents the modeling results. Section four uses the results to construct utility based airport catchment areas and show the impact of parking charges on them.

To attract potential passengers, airline company advertisements are embedded with relevant information for the right customers. Specifically, service-focused advertisements emphasize the comfort of air travel (Curtis et al., 2017; Hu and Luo, 2016) and draw passengers’ attention to in-flight services, such as entertainment, meals, and physical environment (Kim et al., 2016a; Park, 2007). Destination-focused advertisements, however, highlight the attractiveness of tourist destinations the airlines fly to (Curtis et al., 2017; Hu and Luo, 2016). Finally, price-focused advertisements attract price-sensitive passengers by emphasizing the availability of low-price tickets.====Low-cost carriers (LCCs) also invest heavily in advertisements to compete with other LCCs and full-service carriers (FSCs). Since LCCs' emphasis is on the low price rather than the complimentary in-flight services (Lin and Huang, 2015; Loh et al., 2020), service-focused advertisements are rather uncommon for these companies, while price-focused advertisements are quite common. Despite price having been consistently identified as a key determinant for passengers’ choice of LCCs (Buaphiban and Truong, 2017; Chang and Sun, 2012; Pan and Truong, 2018), some LCC advertisements are destination focused. Hence, it is interesting and useful to understand the effectiveness of LCC destination-vis-à-vis price-focused advertisements. This study considers this issue through the combined lenses of the information values provided by advertisements and construal level theory (CLT).====Information has a critical role in tourism, since “information is the blood vessel of the travel industry” (Jung et al., 2018, pp. 86). According to Vogt and Fesenmaier (1998), tourism information offers hedonic and sign values. The hedonic value is the ability of information to create relevant feelings, experiences, and emotions (Kah et al., 2010; Tang and Jang, 2014), while the sign value refers to the information's ability to enhance an individual's self-image or role position towards group members or external audiences (Kah et al., 2010). Since advertisement effectiveness depends on the elements of the message communicated to consumers (Curtis et al., 2017) and information value contributes to consumers' decision making (Vogt and Fesenmaier, 1998), this study suggests that the hedonic and sign values provided by LCCs' destination- and price-focused advertisements can influence passengers' behaviors.====CLT argues that how people react to an event is dependent on their mental representation of that event, and mental construal levels are related to psychological distance (He et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Lee, 2019; Trope and Liberman, 2010). When psychological distance is high, individuals adopt high construal levels to interpret the event, focusing on the main reason (why), desirability, and primary features; for a low psychological distance, they adopt low construal levels, focusing on how to achieve something (how), feasibility, and secondary features (Janakiraman and Ordonez, 2012; Kim et al., 2020; Liberman and Trope, 2008; Stephan et al., 2010). CLT suggests various types of psychological distance, such as social, temporal, spatial, and uncertainty distance (Chen, 2020; Kim et al., 2019; Liberman and Trope, 2008).====Given that overseas leisure trips are often planned well before departure, pre-trip planning involves temporal distance, the perceived proximity of the event in time (Kim et al., 2008). Since the intention as well as the inherent value of a leisure trip is to visit tourist destinations (Fiedler, 2007) with flying an LCC as a mean to achieve it, and pre-trip planning moves from fantasy to reality (Decrop and Snelders, 2004), tourists will likely focus on the destination (why and desirability) for a high temporal distance, and on price (how and feasibility) for a low temporal distance. Therefore, when a leisure trip includes flying an LCC, and when the leisure trip is considered as a whole with flying LCC being a component to realize the trip, the LCC's destination-rather than price-focused advertisements should be more effective at a high temporal distance. However, CLT also suggests that a shift in consideration from primary to secondary features could occur as the temporal distance decreases (Chou and Lien, 2012; Trautmann and Van de Kuilen, 2012). Since LCC passengers are often price-sensitive (Lin and Huang, 2015; Lu, 2017) and price is the main reason why they fly LCCs rather than FSCs (Jung and Yoo, 2014), a counter-argument is price should be a primary feature for tourists in their capacity as LCC passengers when viewing LCC advertisements. Hence, price-focused advertisements should also be effective for a high temporal distance. Given these contradictory projections, analyzing this issue can indicate whether individuals see themselves as tourists or passengers when viewing LCC advertisements.====Consequently, by considering the effectiveness of LCC advertisements through the combined lenses of tourism information values (hedonic and sign values) and CLT (temporal distance), this study investigates:====This study thus adds to advertising effectiveness literature, being one of the few empirical studies that consider the under-researched sign value and apply CLT to consider the impact of the hedonic and sign values offered by the information (Jung et al., 2018; Kah et al., 2010) embedded within an advertisement on advertisement effectiveness. This approach is also important for practical reasons for the LCC advertising marketing, since “understanding vacation-related information value in the tourism situation is also crucial to efficiently delivering relevant information to potential tourists” (Cho and Jang, 2008, pp. 72).",The application of information values and construal level theory for examining low cost carrier advertisements,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305408,15 October 2020,2020,Research Article,276.0

We found that the 7 most representative criteria were able to deal with approximately 80% of the perceived risk by the experts, indicating that a considerable part of the resources of the Brazilian airport infrastructure operations could be being redirected towards a more rational application. Finally, we applied the method in a real scenario situation by analyzing real data from the 29 the busiest Brazilian airports. Data showed objectively that 18 airports presented scores that clearly indicated being in a favorable (safer) or unfavorable (risky) condition regarding the criteria analyzed, guiding where the state can spend the resources with the best benefit.","The Standard and Recommended Practices (SARPs), issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), are standards and best practices for global civil aviation. They are intended to ensure uniformity, efficiency and safety of aviation among all signatory States of the Convention on International Civil Aviation.====The ICAO published in 2016 an Annex containing standards and recommendations for operational safety management within the Member States and their respective Civil Aviation Service Providers (ICAO, 2016). This document, Annex 19 - Safety Management, complemented the guidelines from DOC 9859 - Safety Management Manual (ICAO, 2013). This Annex supports the continuous evolution of proactive strategies aiming the improvement of safety. The set of these strategies was then called the State Safety Programme (SSP), which focused in the systematic treatment of the inherent risks to States' actions when supervising and regulating the civil aviation industry. SSP is a management system to improve the States' regulatory and administrative capacity of providing safety through the operators. Additionally, DOC 9734 - State's Safety Oversight Manual presents the key elements for structuring the States' technical regulations to satisfactorily perform safety oversight functions (ICAO, 2011, 2006). These guidelines specify that each State member must establish its SSP aiming to achieve an Acceptable Level of Safety Performance (ALoSP). In addition, each SSP should have specific goals related to the achievement of the As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) for air transport activities, as stated in States' policies. In this context, the States need to monitor the safety results of their civil aviation systems. This monitoring should be performed considering safety indicators and targets. This action is also foreseen in Annex 19 (ICAO, 2016).====In line with these guidelines, the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) published in 2015 its Specific Operational Safety Program (PSOE-ANAC), that establishes the country's approach to operational safety management (ANAC, 2015). It highlights that civil aviation activities under the supervision of the Agency shall be subject to a performance monitoring process based on acceptable indicators, targets and acceptable levels of safety performance. Thus, civil aviation risks can be properly managed. This monitoring process must be applied to supervise the activities under the ANAC's jurisdiction, i.e. the technical activities regulated by ICAO Annexes, including Annex 14 -Aerodromes Volume 1 - Design and Operation (ICAO, 2014).====These activities are conducted based on two different approaches: (1) the assessment of real/statistical risk and (2) the estimation/prediction of the risk. The real/statistical risk is related to monitoring statistical recurrence of significant data from undesired events after their occurrence. The estimation/prediction of the risk is based on the perception of individuals or in structured models before the actual realization of the risk, i.e. perceived and predictive risk monitoring (Janic, 2000).====This paper aims to propose a multicriteria methodology to predict risk monitoring by experts’ perception at airports. To achieve this objective, a MCDA-C (Methodology Multicriteria Decision Aid – Constructivist) methodology was tested with the aspects of maintenance of airport runways. If proved feasible, the technique may be replicated to other safety aspects of an airport.",RISK assessment in airport maintenance runway condition using MCDA-C,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305317,12 October 2020,2020,Research Article,277.0

This paper adds to the literature by presenting a comprehensive study of the predictive performance of connectivity indices in estimating aggregate itinerary market shares. Our empirical analysis encompasses both nonstop and connecting itineraries that originated or destined in Europe during 2018. The predictive accuracies of the respective measures are assessed against actual market shares and an ad-hoc benchmark derived from a logit-based calibrated index and evaluated in terms of their prediction-error distributions. Our results suggest that the use of connectivity indices can significantly improve the assessment of itinerary market shares relative to conventional size-based measures (up to 16.9% gain in accuracy over itinerary frequency). These improvements, along with their use of standard formulations and lack of a calibration requirement, make connectivity models a valuable tool for practitioners to use in allocating aggregate air travel flows. An examination of different scenarios—short-/medium (SH/MH)-vs. long-haul (LH) and sizeable vs. thin markets—reveals that determination of the best index is not a straightforward task and provides guidance to selecting the best connectivity measure.","Connectivity models have been subject of a great number of scientific works. Studies in the transport industry conventionally employ connectivity indices to evaluate the level and quality of transport alternatives provided in a given region or related to transport infrastructures such as ports, train stations, and airports (e.g., Burghouwt and Redondi, 2013; Tovar et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018). In the air transport context, the literature has primarily focused on connectivity models that assign a quantifiable value to individual itineraries—direct flights or sequences of connecting flights between pairs of airports—and specifically capture the burden associated with longer waiting times and detours. To this end, air connectivity indices consider specific major routing-related features of flight alternatives, such as flying and connecting times and the number of stops, that eventually underpin the level of service provided to passengers.====Air connectivity models are employed for a number of purposes ranging from determining the influence of air transport on the local economy (Percoco, 2010) to more practical goals such as making investments choices or strategical decisions (Allroggen et al., 2015; Burghouwt and Redondi, 2013; Zhu et al., 2018). The widespread use of connectivity models follows from the fact that they consistently evaluate main itinerary attributes affecting passenger demand (Birolini et al., 2020; Coldren et al., 2003). Additionally, compared to the development of ad-hoc models, they are characterized by standard formulas and do not require calibration.====In this study, we explored the extent to which conventional connectivity indices are good predictors of itinerary market shares and can accordingly assist practitioners in allocating air traffic flows. To test the prediction accuracy of conventional connectivity models, we used an extensive dataset covering all flights from/to Europe during 2018 and compared the estimated market shares obtained under different models with both the actual itinerary market shares and a reasonable benchmark derived from an ad-hoc calibrated index.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we outline the contribution of our work, describing the different usages of connectivity models and their potential employment in forecasting itinerary market shares. Section 3 summarizes previously developed connectivity models and their most important features.

In order to achieve this, a two-step quantitative-qualitative research approach was conducted. In the first step, a two-stage ","In a highly globalized world, transporting people and products efficiently is becoming increasingly more essential. Among the various modes of transportation that are available to make this displacement as fast and economical as possible, the aerial approach deserves attention.====Although it has a high relative cost, it is the fastest form of transport, and it can be used when traveling for any distance, if the destinations are connected. Such connections are made through airports, which is the name given to public access spaces with structures for takeoffs and landings (runways) and for aircraft movement as well as support structures for operations.====Airports are among the most important infrastructure elements for a nation's development. They connect not only people but also economies, which is critical for job creation and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. (Olfat et al., 2016).====To Mayer (2016), airports play a vital role in providing infrastructure for the industry, because they represent the fastest way to transport products. This is especially beneficial for high added value or highly perishable products.====Jiang et al. (2019), argues that the air transport industry has developed rapidly since the 1980s, increasing competition among the actors involved and operating costs. In this sense, Bottasso et al. (2013) highlights that the current scenario, with rapid growth and increasing demand as well as the growing presence of low-cost airlines, creates an environment of pressure on airport management to increase their efficiency.====According to Zhang et al. (2012), the increase in air demand has two immediate effects: pressure on infrastructure to increase installed capacity and urgency to efficiently use available resources to ease pressure in the short term.====From an academic perspective, the interest in airport efficiency analysis is notorious. In recent years there have been an increasing number of studies on the subject such as Gillen et al. (2016), Fernandes and Pacheco (2002), Yoshida and Fujimoto (2004), Fung et al. (2008), Curi et al. (2010), Wanke (2013), Ahn and Min (2014), Keskin and Köksal (2019), and others.====In this regard, Lai et al. (2015) highlight that airport efficiency assessment has been a research area of great interest in recent years. According to the authors, these analyses are important for a wide range of stakeholders such as airports, regulatory agencies, governments, passengers, and airlines.====To Baltazar et al. (2018), the proliferation of empirical studies about efficiency assessment in airport infrastructure is such that it is currently considered a key theme regarding the economic and managerial aspects of airports and has become a focus of interest in the scientific literature in recent years.====Barros et al. (2017), argue that airport efficiency studies are important because they produce relevant competitiveness insights and reveal inherent capabilities (i.e., practices, tools, and other factors) that are present in airports with better performance. These capabilities can be considered efficiency drivers that have great importance for the managers’ decision making process.====In addition, Bezzerra and Gomes (2016) states that, airports worldwide have been no longer considered solely as huge facilities and public utilities, but complex service organizations operated in a commercial-like way and consequently, a broader perspective of airport performance is needed, as well as the development of reliable performance measurement practices.====Another important contribution to understanding the importance of studies about this theme is proposed by Fasone and Zapata-Aguirre (2016). After a critical review of the literature they stated that the proliferation of empirical studies assessing the efficiency at the level of airports is such that today it is one of the key research issues within airport economics and management and has been the focus of intense research in recent years. The authors also argue that the drivers of efficiency of airports are an important issue that should be addressed by the researchers of this field.====Considering the above arguments, two important research questions emerge. First, in a global scenario, which airports can be considered efficient? Second, what are the operational efficiency drivers of these airports?====To answer these questions, this study proposes to use a two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) based methodology with airports around the world. The study aims to evaluate their technical efficiency and to conduct a multiple case study to identify the elements that can be considered efficiency drivers.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents a review of the literature on efficiency driving practices, section 3 describes the methodological framework used in the study.

Specifically, indicators of PCS jointly enhance safety motivation. In turn, safety motivation reduces safety violations, while enhancing SCP. Theoretical and practical implications evoked from the results advance existing knowledge of organizationally social interactions in promoting safety and the motivational mechanism through which PCS predicts employees' safety performance outcomes.","Air transportation is constantly growing with 4 billion passengers and 64 million tonnes of cargo being transported in 2018 (International air transportation association annual report, 2019). This massive increase in supply and demand for air transportation services might result in higher accident probability (Hsu et al., 2010). Even though air transportation has been found as the safest mode of transportation for long distance travel (IATA annual report, 2019), any low-probability accident in aviation industry could result in tremendous costs in terms of loss of life (Chen et al., 2017). Accordingly, international civil aviation organization (ICAO) (2013) in its Air Navigation Plan referred to air safety as the highest priority for the aviation industry. In fact, flight safety is the most significant concern in the aviation industry which can be neither underestimated nor compromised (Bandeira et al., 2018; Barak and Dahooei, 2018; Chen et al., 2017; Chen and Vincent, 2018). Under this circumstance, airline managers are advised to extensively develop strategies to promote safety performance outcomes among employees. Flight attendants are boundary spanning front line employees in the airline industry who are responsible for inflight service provision while providing and maintaining cabin safety (Kao et al., 2009). According to Ji et al. (2019), flight attendants are playing a vital role in the overall safety of the airline industry and the quality and relevance of their performance would directly affect air travel safety. With this stated, airline managers should develop a situation that positively manipulates flight attendants' motivation for safety. In line with social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) and the norm of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960), psychological contract of safety (PCS) which “is defined as the beliefs of individuals about reciprocal safety obligations inferred from implicit and explicit promises” (Walker, 2010, p. 315) occurs when employees perceive that their employer is providing them with safety concerns and services and they tend to reciprocate such input by showing positive safety performance outcomes. PCS is an emerging concept in safety literature that deals with an extremely neglected area of concern, namely organizationally based social exchanges between employees and the employer on safety (Newaz et al., 2019a, b). It is assumed that PSC would enhance employees' motivation for safety. In turn, such employees are inclined towards positive safety performance outcomes (i.e. safety creative performance) while demonstrating lower propensity to engage in negative safety performance outcomes (i.e. safety violations). Safety creative performance (SCP) deals with employees' willingness and ability to generate novel ideas regarding safety. Moreover, safety violations such as failing to adhere to briefed instructions, violating training rules, not being properly prepared for the flight or intentionally ignore safety commands is a form of intentional unsafe behavior that willfully disregard safety rules and regulations (Wiegmann and Shappell, 2001). In light of the discussion provided above, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that investigates the mediating effect of safety motivation in the relationship between PCS and flight attendants' SCP and safety violations. Particularly, this conceptual model has been empirically tested in the airline industry for the importance of safety as the main objective of air transportation (Barak & Dahooei,2018; Chen et al., 2017).",Dose safety motivation mediate the effect of psychological contract of safety on flight attendants' safety performance outcomes?: A social exchange perspective,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305287,10 October 2020,2020,Research Article,281.0

In the commercial air sector, and in this same period, the flag airline was privatized and new air operators, including low cost airlines (LCC), entered the market. Since 2012, air fares are completely deregulated. Consequently, in the last two and a half decades, passenger transport in Colombia grew by 863%. This important growth rate has been driven and led by the country's main airport, the Bogotá-El Dorado International Airport (BOG), in the capital of Colombia. But some technical reports consider the airport will reach its maximum capacity in the short term mainly because of its inability to expand its airfield (runway system). Due to this circumstance, the aeronautical public authority of Colombia gave course to the planning, design and construction of a new airport (complementary) on the outskirts of the city of Bogotá, which will enter the design phase in 2026/2027. Therefore, it is considered suitable the development of a traffic forecast for BOG in the medium term and to evaluate the impact of future demand on the runway capacity of the airport. Then, and due to the complexity of the air transport forecast, the use of System Dynamics (SD), is considered to be appropriate as an analysis approach. System Dynamics is based on feedback control theory and it is equipped with mathematical computer simulation models, which uses linear and non-linear differential equations. The results suggests a need to expand the airport case study (runway system) after mid-2019, where the current capacity utilization factor is around 100% and two to three runways will be required for the normal operation; after October 2022 the number runways required is set to three until the last period simulated (2023).","The uninterrupted growth of air traffic in Colombia has been reinforced since the 1990s by a public policy of liberalization of airspace, and by redirecting public and private investment towards the modernization of airport infrastructures (Díaz Olariaga, 2016, 2017).

Due to the complexity of the forecast of air transport, the use of the System Dynamics (hereinafter SD) approach is founded appropriate for the present investigation, since with SD it is possible to develop a model to forecast the demand of operations on runway and evaluate its impact over the capacity of the BOG runway system. Basically, once a set of variables of level, flow and parameters that must be included in the model are defined, the limits of the model, the subsystems, the causality structures and the level flows will be established, and then we proceed to quantify the model and run the simulation referred to the airport object of the case study.

Maintenance at airports includes a set of activities that undergo continuous innovation to ensure safety, provide quality construction and avoid excessive air traffic delays, all of which entails a complex system.====One of the characteristics of this complex system is the high number of interfaces and agents involved. For each runway construction project, a network of collaborations is established and subsequently dismantled at the end of the project. The number of specialized nodes in such a network (the number of companies involved) is large, and the exchange of information is more frequent and relevant than ever. To experience failures or breakdowns in information exchange means exposure to relevant risks, such as delays due to a lack of synchronization in resources or tasks.====The basic functions of airfield pavement are to provide adequate bearing capacity, good rolling qualities and satisfactory surface friction characteristics. Ease of maintenance, durability and sustainability are other requirements that have become more relevant over time. Since the decision to resurface or rehabilitate should not be taken lightly, sufficient data for the decision-making process from a number of sources should be obtained well in advance. This data can include those specific to the pavement conditions, as well as others, such as the traffic forecast, weather forecast, budget and consultation with stakeholders, amongst others (Tighe and Covalt, 2008).====As in the general construction field, the construction industry has faced a significant crisis due to the economic downturn. Accordingly, network collaboration has become essential. Generally speaking, the market is highly fragmented. The same occurs with different services, such as with the role of communications, document management and interoperability, amongst others. Additionally, proper skills to integrate diverse software and hardware and systems to manage and communicate digitally are also required.====During the past ten years until the present time, some of the limitations have been addressed. For example, several open standards for managing data have been adopted, as well as a methodology for managing the information assets of construction projects. Indeed, various developments have had an impact on the field, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which allows creating a scenario for detecting different parameters and establishing a connection between the physical and digital worlds from where the paradigm of cyber-physical equivalence or digital twin emerges. The digital twin concept envisages a comprehensive physical and functional description of a component, product or system, which includes information that could be useful in all lifecycle phases (Glaessgen and Stargel, 2012).====Still several problems remain because tools for project planning and business management have not been sufficiently developed, but an integrated and scalable solution for all necessary functionalities and the different types of projects, is not available (Shen et al., 2008). The ability to assess uncertainties, risks and the impact of failures has not been developed due to the limitations of the available tools.====An automated project and maintenance management environment, integrated among all phases of the lifecycle, will enable all project partners and project functions to interconnect their systems, processes and equipment. This in turn will drastically reduce the time and cost of planning, design and construction. Smart construction involves different aspects, including productivity (Kuenzel et al., 2016), but also safety (Li, 2017) and site control (Pradhananga and Teizer, 2013), which can benefit from the adoption of advanced technology.====For construction projects and in particular, airport pavement maintenance, due to the impact of the out-of-service periods, the efficient and effective management of operations is critical. For example, the implementation phase in a fully operational runway, requires a longer duration than a construction phase, while in the last phase decisions are taken almost in “continuous real time” (Paris Loreiro et al., 2019). Therefore, it is relevant to promote the collaboration of stakeholders throughout the value chain because it enables accurate, well-informed decisions to be made throughout the lifecycle. To this end, tools created to manage digital information provide the opportunity for integration of all those flows of digital information. Therefore, such a digital fostered management approach, such as Building Information Management (BIM), can provide opportunities for digitalization in construction, which can improve pavement management.====This paper seeks to identify opportunities that digitalization in the construction field provides the airport transport system, by adding additional reliability to the relevant subsystems. In particular, the objective is to promote more effective cooperation between stakeholders as well as a more efficient management of the processes. It can be illustrated through the optimization of data storage, use and transformation of the pavement maintenance program (Mäki and Kerosuo, 2015). Section 2 presents a short review of the enabling technologies involved. Section 3 is devoted to current specific activities related to the airport pavement management, including the entire life cycle, insofar as the objective is to utilize such a use case as a reference for analysis, comparison and discussion. Section 4 proposes a BIM execution plan guideline for the integration between the Airport Pavement Management System (APMS) and BIM model. Section 5 presents the proposed framework enabled to use Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) as a technological layer thereby enabling the integration of different sources, including object disposal (by means of BIM), referenced documents, IoT based sensor data streams, etc. Finally, the last Section draws conclusions and addresses the limitations and managerial implications.","Opportunities in airport pavement management: Integration of BIM, the IoT and DLT",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972030524X,7 October 2020,2020,Research Article,284.0

For some, change is now being driven by current or emerging technologies such as augmented reality (Eschen, 2018), Big Data Analytics (Mullan, 2019), blockchain (Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020), cloud computing (Amadeus, 2014), cognitive computing (Herrema et al., 2019; Sadjadi and Jarrah, 2011), cybersecurity (ACI, 2020), systems integration (Stocking et al., 2009), the Internet of Things (Mariani et al., 2019; Zmud et al., 2018) and virtual modelling and simulation (Ørsted, 2019). These technologies allow airports to develop systems that monitor, visualise and respond to digital processes and functions in real-time, and as part of a wider ecosystem that connects all stakeholders (Halpern et al., 2021). They therefore enable airports to implement ecosystem-level changes that are needed for digital transformation (ACI, 2017; Pell and Blondel, 2018).====However, digital change does not occur by accident. Instead, it requires strong investment across the organisation because the disruptive potential of change, especially for more mature stages of digital transformation, extends beyond technologies. It describes a paradigmatic shift in the way that technologies are adopted and used, and at an organisational level. The extent to which airports address organisational challenges associated with transforming their business is therefore expected go some way to determining digital change (Halpern et al., 2021). Despite this, organisational challenges associated with digital change have been overlooked in transportation literature where instead, the focus tends to be on technologies, for instance in terms of the use of them at airports or use cases for the future (Adey, 2004; Bouma et al., 2016; Chiti et al., 2018; del Rio, 2016; Eschen et al., 2018; Haas, 2004; Halpern and Regmi, 2013; Lee et al., 2014; Martin-Domingo and Martín, 2016; Straker and Wrigley, 2018; Wattanacharoensil and Schuckert, 2015); issues associated with passenger acceptance of them (Gures et al., 2018; Morosan, 2016; Negri et al., 2019; Wittmer, 2011); or their impact on passenger behaviour (Castillo-Manzano and López-Valpuesta, 2013), airport service quality (Brida et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2015; Pitt et al., 2002) or airport capacity (Kalakou et al., 2015). Knowledge of the organisational challenges remains largely anecdotal – described in the reports of industry associations or consulting firms advising airports how to prepare for digital transformation (ACI, 2017; Boutin et al., 2016; Pell and Blondel, 2018). There is therefore a lack of empirical evidence on what the challenges are and how they affect change.====Addressing the gap in literature, this study investigates organisational challenges associated with digital change at airports. The main focus is on the effect of organisational readiness. However, the effects of innovation and airport size and ownership are also examined. The findings are based on a survey of managers at 94 airports worldwide with data analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Section 2 of this paper provides study context with a closer look at digital change at airports and the organisational challenges associated with it. Hypotheses to be tested in the analysis are also provided in Section 2. Section 3 describes the methodology in terms of the constructs and indicators used, sample characteristics, and the analytical approach. Section 4 presents findings of the analysis. Section 5 provides a discussion and conclusion that highlights main contributions, study limitations and recommendations for future research.","Ready for digital transformation?

Therefore, predicting customer behavior allows travel companies to maximize their profits, minimize their loss of revenue by balancing supply and demand (e.g., determining an overbooking level), and wisely respond to pressures from the government and customer groups to lessen cancellation penalties. For this reason, it is important to investigate what cause people to cancel their travel plans after reservations have been made. Based on construal level theory (CLT), this study tries to identify the reasons for the cancellation behavior of customers in accordance with different types of psychological distance between travelers and their travel or reservation behavior. Moreover, it examines the moderating role of tourists’ dependence on a travel agency in these relationships for predicting tourist cancellation patterns in a more specific manner.","Recently, a video of a passenger getting dragged out of the overbooked United Airlines flight after refusing to give up his seat received considerable attention in social media (CNN, 2017). The airline became the focus of criticism, with some people declaring a boycott against it (New York Times, 2017). This case shows how important it is for airlines to determine overbooking levels as well as to communicate with their customers.====This failure of determining an overbooking level was caused by the failure to predict customer behavior. In fact, predicting customer behavior is considered one of the most important tasks in the tourism industry (Upchurch et al., 2002), as travel products such as package tours, air and hotel packages (hereafter Airtels), hotel rooms, and airline seats have the characteristics that they lose their value as soon as the reserved date passes or the airplane takes off (i.e., the feature of perishability) (Sahay, 2007). Balancing supply and demand in order to maximize revenue per customer, an activity known as yield management thus plays an important role in the tourism industry (Dunn and Brooks, 1990; Upchurch et al., 2002). One of the main objectives of this field is to better understand the patterns of customer behavior in order to maximize profits. For instance, airlines have determined an overbooking level by forecasting the probability of booking survivals in order to reduce the costs incurred by empty seats on a flight (Iliescu, Garrow & Parker, 2006, 2008). Another example of this attempt to maximize profits is American Airlines’ DINAMO, a program developed in 1988 to help price airline seats based on demand and cancellation probability forecasts (Höpken et al., 2015; Smith et al., 1992). As shown in these examples, data on customer cancellation behavior has been used mainly to forecast demand or price products and services for yield management.====Predicting customer behavior also helps airlines respond wisely to pressures from the government and customer groups to revise their cancellation policies or lessen their cancellation penalties. Cancellation fees represent the strongest conflict between tourism companies and their customers. In the case of South Korea, a majority of complaints regarding airline services (766 out of 900 cases) concerned cancellation fees levied by airlines (The Korea Times, 2016). In Australia, there has been long-standing customer complaints against airlines’ refund and cancellation policies (Herald Sun, 2016). In the United States, the amount of registration cancellation fees levied by airlines increased from 0.71 billion U.S. dollars (USD) in 2004 to 3.01 billion USD in 2015 (Statista, 2016). Governments and consumer groups have responded to this situation by pressing travel companies to revise their cancellation policies or lessen their cancellation penalties. Due to the perishability of travel products, however, travel companies are unable to avoid losses of revenue without levying cancellation fees to their customers (Ivanov et al., 2015); in the case of cancellation, they have to have a clearance sale for unsold products and services just before the reserved date passes or the airplane takes off (Sahay, 2007). Therefore, investigating what make people cancel their travel plans could help better determine overbooking levels, which would lead to minimizing losses to travel agencies and other stakeholders.====For this purpose, we employ construal level theory (CLT) proposed by Trope et al. (2007), which is a prominent theory that explains changing reactions of individuals with some important dimensions of psychological distance and has been actively adopted in investigations into the changing behaviors of travelers (e.g., Kah et al., 2016; Massara and Severino, 2013). Accordingly, in our paper, we regard cancellation behavior as a potential tourist's changing reaction to travel after making the reservation and investigate the impacts of psychological distance on a tourist's cancellation behavior based on CLT. To be more specific, we attempt to identify the reasons for customer cancellation behavior in relation to five different types of psychological distance between customers and their travel or reservation behavior. Moreover, we use the premise of Thomas and Tsai (2011), which postulated the existence of a bidirectional relationship between a doer's perceived task difficulty and psychological distance, to assume that the difficulties of handling travel plans are differently perceived based on psychological distance and thus posit that the impacts of psychological distance on cancellation behavior are different in accordance with the tourists' dependence on a travel agency. Therefore, the purposes of this study are as follows: (1) to identify several important types of psychological distance potential tourists might perceive when reacting to travel after the reservation (i.e., spatial, temporal, experiential, arbitrary, and economic distances) based on CLT, (2) to examine the impacts of these types of psychological distance on tourist cancellation behavior, and (3) further to examine the moderating role of tourists' dependence on travel agencies in these relationships in order to predict tourists' cancellation patterns in a more specific manner. With the results of this study, we provide some implications for both practitioners and researchers who wish to better understand travelers' cancellation behavior.","Out of sight, out of cancellation: The impact of psychological distance on the cancellation behavior of tourists",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305251,4 October 2020,2020,Research Article,286.0

We study a flight rescheduling problem to react to cargo demand disruptions in the short run. To increase flexibility, we consider two different cargo assignment policies. We propose a matheuristic approach to solve the problem that provides high-quality solutions in a short computational time, based on column generation in which each subproblem is solved using an ad-hoc heuristic. The approach is tested on demand disruption instances containing up to 75 air cargo orders with different penalty levels. The results show that the proposed method improves profit by 54% over the solution generated by a commercial MIP solver within a 1-h time limit, and by 15% over the solution with the routes fixed as in the original flight planning that only allows cargo to be re-routed. We also show that there exist incremental benefits in the range of 3–5% by allowing cargo for a given order to be transported by various aircraft.","Air cargo can be carried either in dedicated freighters, that is, aircraft designed exclusively for cargo transport, or in the spare capacity in passenger aircraft bellies after baggage has been loaded. Although in recent years the annual added payload capacity in bellies has surpassed that of freighters by ever increasing margins (in 2018 it was almost 4 times greater) (====), freighters have certain advantages that continue to make them indispensable to any air cargo operation. They can, for example, carry types of loads that passenger aircraft cannot, such as oversize items or dangerous cargo. Furthermore, the supply characteristics of bellies on passenger flights, either because of their schedules, markets served or spare capacity, do not necessarily coordinate well with the characteristics of air cargo demand (====One of the principal factors differentiating air cargo transport from air passenger transport is the high level of uncertainty in demand for the former. The sources of this uncertainty are the very short time windows in which cargo bookings are made (====) and the frequent occurrence of cargo no-shows or only partial show-ups (====). The problem typically arises just hours before a departure, causing an imbalance between planned supply and real demand.====To deal with these demand disruptions, which are difficult to anticipate, cargo airlines first intensify their sales-efforts and make focussed, last-minute adjustments to their schedule planning based on the experience of decision-makers charged with modifying schedules manually. A range of measures are employed, alone or in combination, such as adjust fleet allocation, flight cancellations, aircraft rerouting (e.g. triangle flights) and flying aircraft empty to reallocate cargo (where doing makes economic sense). These operational actions are challenging since they have to comply with the bilateral agreements between countries, frequency restrictions and must be adopted within short time frames.==== were the first to review the state of the art in airline scheduling. Since that time, numerous works have been published on airline schedule planning, covering topics such as incremental design of passenger schedules (====; ====), the simultaneous schedule design and fleet assignment problem (====; ====; ====) and disturbances or unexpected events. The latter have been studied from two different perspectives, the first one based on the development of robust schedule planning models (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) and the second one on operational schedule recovery models. In this group we find the aircraft recovery problem (====; ====; ====), the integrated aircraft and passenger recovery problem (====; ====; ====) and the integrated aircraft and crew schedule recovery problem (====; ====).====Although schedule recovery models have been analyzed in depth for passenger air transport, little work has yet been done on the recovery problem in the air cargo business. Disturbances in the passenger industry are of a different nature from those arising in the cargo market and are due mainly to weather or the propagation of delays caused by late or cancelled flights rather than demand fluctuations. Unexpected changes in demand are frequent, affecting the supply chain due to deviations in production, transportation, and storage costs, among others. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused an explosive increase in the demand for products such as masks and respirators. The literature has studied demand disruptions with a focus on supply chain coordination. ==== consider one supplier - one retailer and propose a two-period model. In the first period, before the demand is known, a production plan is decided, which suffers modifications in the second once the actual demand is revealed. The authors study how changes to the original plan produce significant deviation costs to the system and derive conditions under which the supply chain can be coordinated. ====, study this coordination problem considering two competing retailers where the decision of one retailer affects the other since some customers may switch between them. ==== extend it to the case of one dominant retailer and multiple fringe retailers.====Another major difference between passenger and air cargo transport lies in the type of corrective actions taken when disturbances occur. For passenger transport, the legs of a route cannot be changed in the short run due to passenger preferences for certain itineraries, but with air freight, there is greater flexibility in the legs actually flown since what counts is that the cargo arrive at its destination by the stipulated deadline regardless of the route actually taken.====One of the first published studies in a cargo context is that of ==== develop an embedded multi-commodity minimum cost flow problem (MCFP) that chooses transit (stopover) airports for the design of a cargo network linking China and Taiwan using belly space on passenger flights.==== present a model that integrates the strategic processes of cargo airline route design and fleet assignment. By using a weekly planning horizon, the solutions can be applied in short-term operations. The authors formulate the problem as an MCFP assuming a single fleet. The idea is to integrate a flight network with a cargo network (O-D pairs) and design a route starting from zero independent of any base plan that considers all possible flight legs and incurs no flight cancellation penalties. The solution employs various heuristics based on the number of stops that must be made to pick up and deliver cargo to its destination. ==== extend this model to scenarios where there are alliances between airlines that require coordinated scheduling. ==== devise a model that integrates route design for passenger, cargo and combi flights. The problem is formulated as an integer MCFP and a series of heuristics are proposed for solving it.==== address freighter route planning using a formulation that simultaneously optimizes flight choice, aircraft rotations and cargo routing. The emphasis in the authors’ approach is on incrementally improving schedules through flight choice changes. Continuing in this vein, ====, after surveying the general problem of cargo flight planning and its subproblems, then turn their attention to the air cargo scheduling problem. They present a model that integrates several stages including itinerary design, fleet assignment, and aircraft and cargo routing. However, the planning generated by the model is confined to an externally predefined list of mandatory and optional flights, the latter incorporated only to the extent they generate profits. To the best of our knowledge, the only paper that deals with air cargo schedule recovery is ====. In their work, they propose a mixed integer programming model to redesign an operational schedule in an air cargo network and introduced three comparison schemes to estimate the cost of rescheduling. For a recent review for the literature regarding air cargo operations, please refer to ====.====What emerges from the above review is that the problem of cargo route adjustment in response to last-minute demand disruptions has been given little attention in the literature at the operational level. This problem has a number of special characteristics: time is a limited resource, there is no predefined flight list and minor adjustments to the base planning scheme must be doable. The principal contributions of the present article that distinguish it from prior studies may be summed up as follows:====The remainder of this paper is organized into four sections. Section ==== models the problem to be solved, setting out the notation, the main assumptions and the cargo assignment policies. Section ==== describes the proposed solution method, including the column generation technique and the heuristic developed to solve each subproblem. Section ==== reports the computational results for a set of air cargo instances with demand disruption used to test the model. Finally, Section ==== presents our conclusions.====Under policy P1 the proposed model allows aircraft to pick up part of an order from a node and the nodes can be visited by more than one aircraft. The cargo assignment (CA) method must assign an amount of cargo (====) to each node ==== on each route ==== generated by the operators while satisfying the load capacity restrictions (8)–(11) in the original problem. It does this by greedily assigning each of the nodes its full demand sequentially, in the order in which the aircraft visits them. If this results in the aircraft's load capacity being exceeded, the cargo reassignment (CR) linear optimization problem shown below is executed to redistribute the cargo among the nodes. The method thus has a hybrid function. This sequential approach, first applying the greedy algorithm and then the CR program only if capacity constraints are violated, is much faster than simply applying the LP to every case.====(CR)====subject to:====where ==== is the set of orders that correspond to the nodes visited on route ====. The objective of this problem is to maximize profit on the transport of the set of orders associated with the route. Constraint (A2) prevents any cargo from being assigned to the initial and final nodes on the route associated with the start and end of the planning horizon. Constraint (A3) ensures that the cargo at the pickup and delivery nodes for each order is the same. Constraints (A4) and (A5) impose that the cargo associated with a pickup be non-negative and less than the order's total demand. Constraints (A6) and (A7) restrict the continuity of the cargo. Constraint (A8) is the aircraft load capacity restriction.

The passengers' flow is simulated to obtain queue lengths at one busy European airport between 2014 and 2016, supported by real flight data.

Aircraft ground operations are impacted significantly by the current pandemic situation so that standard operating procedures need a redesign to incorporate the upcoming sanitation requirements. In particular, the passenger boarding process is challenged with requirements for physical distances between passengers, while in addition to standard cleaning, the cabin has to be disinfected after each flight. We evaluate potential alterations of these two aircraft cabin processes with respect to a pre-pandemic reference aircraft turnaround. The implementation of microscopic approaches allows to consider individual interactions and a step-wise process adaptation aiming for an efficient operational design. We find a significant extension of boarding times (more than doubled) if the physical distance rule is applied. The new disinfection process further extends the critical path of the turnaround, so we see a high impact on airport and airline operations. To compensate for the increased workload and process times, we provide an integrated cleaning and disinfection procedure with additional personnel. Our results indicate that the pre-pandemic turnaround times cannot be maintained for the same seat load, even if the process adaptations are being implemented. However, a seat allocation scheme with empty middle-seats (seat load of 67%) and the use of an apron position (additional use of rear aircraft door for boarding) enable pre-pandemic turnaround times without additional cleaning personnel. Aircraft turnarounds at terminal positions require between 10% (with additional personnel) and 20% (without additional personnel) more ground time.","Air transportation offers mobility at national/international levels and faces numerous challenges ranging from safety, security, and operational efficiency to the call for zero ====The processes of aircraft ground handling at the airport apron are summarized as aircraft turnaround. For years, airlines have pursued to enhance the efficiency of their turnaround operations to increase flight times of their aircraft and thereby resource utilization. Pushed by the groundbreaking innovations of low-cost carriers, turnaround processes across the entire industry have been shortened, redesigned, or rationalized in the course of the last three decades. Especially cleaning and catering processes have seen the most substantial cut-backs, either being reduced to every second or third turnaround over the day or being operated cursory by cabin crew personnel, leaving full and thorough executions to overnight periods.====The current pandemic situation demands specific changes to the standard operating procedures for several turnaround sub-processes: (a) during aircraft deboarding and boarding, passengers have to comply to a minimum physical distance and (b) in addition to the standard cleaning, the cabin has to be disinfected.

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been recognized as one of the most popular methods for assessing the efficiency scores of the Decision Making Units (DMUs). DEA introduced by Charnes et al. (1978) as a non-parametric approach to measure the efficiency with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. DEA uses the observed values on inputs and outputs to estimate the efficient frontier and identify efficient and inefficient DMUs (Lim and Zhu, 2015). In the real world, DMU's structure may contain several connected processes. DEA considers DMUs as black boxes so that their inputs and outputs are considered in the evaluation, which ignores internal relations of processes (Omrani and Soltanzadeh, 2016). Network DEA (NDEA) models have been proposed as one of the most important approaches for evaluating the system with several processes. Several researches has been carried out on the DEA network in recent years such as the DEA-RAM model (Cooper et al., 1999), producing the relational network DEA approach (Kao and Hwang, 2010), the dynamic network DEA approach (Tone and Tsutsui, 2010), the weighted additive efficiency decomposition approach (Chen et al., 2009), the SBM - NDEA approach (Tone and Tsutsui, 2014) and the Network Slacks-Based Inefficiency (NSBI) approach (Fukuyama and Weber, 2010). The DEA- Range Adjusted Measure model (RAM) is a non-radial model which could demonstrate the slacks of the inputs and outputs (Cui and Li, 2018). Aida et al. (1998) and Cooper et al. (1999) have proposed the RAM model and then, it has been widely used to assess efficiency such as the RAM in Network model (Avkiran and MCRSystal, 2012) and RAM in Dynamic model (Li et al., 2016).====On the other hand, in the real world, data are uncertain in many cases because of the complexity of the system. Some efficient frontiers in DEA are sensitive to uncertainty in data. The unaccountable or inaccessible data can change the efficient frontier (Soltanzadeh and Omrani, 2018). The fuzzy approach has been presented as one of the methods to deal with uncertainties in DEA models. In fuzzy models, the efficiency scores of DMUs are an interval of efficiencies or fuzzy efficiency values (Soltanzadeh and Omrani, 2018). Generally, the fuzzy DEA method is employed when the inputs and outputs have vagueness or uncertainty. Several methods have been developed to solve fuzzy DEA models such as tolerance method (Sengupta, 1992), defuzzification, α-cut, ranking, possibility and credibility approach.====This paper proposes the network DEA-RAM model in the fully fuzzy framework for the first time. In this model, in addition to input and output data, all the variables are considered fuzzy, including the efficiency scores. The proposed model shows uncertainty in real evaluation problems due to the generating efficiency scores as fuzzy numbers. In fact, presenting the fully fuzzy RAM model for the first time is novel in comparison with other researches on DEA-RAM. Unlike α-cut, ranking, credibility and other fuzzy approaches, the proposed model estimates the efficiency scores as a fuzzy numbers without changing any parameters. To solve the proposed fully fuzzy DEA-RAM model, it is converted to a three objective linear programming model. Then, a lexicographic multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) approach is applied to evaluate the efficiency membership of DMUs. This paper uses the lexicographic technique to solve final fully fuzzy linear DEA-RAM model.

While this is sometimes easy for airline planners, sometimes many criteria need to be taken into account to make optimal decisions. Many methods are used in the evaluation process and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been provided satisfactory solutions to airlines in selecting aircraft (====). Airlines have different operational requirements according to their network structures and destinations. Airlines gain flexibility in fleet planning and operations by choosing the most appropriate aircraft for both themselves and passengers. In aircraft selection and fleet planning, aircraft are evaluated based on some their criteria. These criteria are; It can be listed as cost and operation-based criteria. In the selection of aircraft, many different criteria are taken into consideration and the most appropriate aircraft is selected for the fleet structure, planned schedule and company interests and, therefore, a holistic approach is needed for the most appropriate aircraft selection. We propose a novel model for aircraft evaluation and selection based on the interests of both the airlines and passengers. This model evaluates the planes in multiple dimensions (technical aspects, economic aspects and environmental aspects) to help airline planners when choosing appropriate aircraft type.====MCDM methods are important as the structure of the problem is evaluated by various perspectives based on a holistic approach (====). In type-1 fuzzy sets, each element has a degree of membership function in the interval [0, 1]. Even though type-1 fuzzy sets can overcome uncertainty, some imperfections are described in literature. ==== defined the imperfections which are the usage of words, the group of experts, and the noisy data. Therefore, ==== proposed type-2 fuzzy sets having a fuzzy membership function in order to overcome these problems. In contrast to a type-1 fuzzy set, which has the membership grade as a crisp number, an interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2Fs) has membership functions which are also fuzzy numbers. Whilst type-1 fuzzy sets have membership function which are two-dimensional, type-2 fuzzy are three-dimensional. The third dimension provides additional degrees of freedom for possibility in models of uncertainty (====).====In the study, firstly, previous studies on aircraft selection were examined. The criteria and the sub-criteria used in the studies were collected into a pool. 3 main criteria groups were then determined by taking these criteria into consideration; technical criteria, economic criteria, and ==== criteria. Then 7 sub-criteria for technical criteria, 4 sub-criteria for economic criteria, and 2 sub-criteria for environmental effects criteria were defined. Since it is not possible to use all these sub-criteria in aircraft selection, the sub-criteria which were to be used were determined by taking expert opinions into account. The technical criteria and the economic criteria were separately evaluated by the IT2FAHP method. As a result, the highest-weight sub-criteria determined by decision-makers through the IT2FAHP method were used for aircraft selection. In the next stage, the model of aircraft selection was applied with a total of 8 criteria consisting of 4 technical criteria, 2 economic criteria and 2 environmental effects criteria. After this stage, the weights of these 8 criteria were calculated by using IT2FAHP on the equal comparisons. The weight of these criteria indicates which criteria have the most importance or weight in aircraft selection. In the last stage, the solution was reached by ranking the aircraft to be selected with the IT2FTOPSIS method.====In the literature, many studies have been carried out on aircraft selection using MCDM methods. ==== classified the studies in the field of aviation using MCDM methods, however, it is seen that the number of aviation studies using IT2Fs MCDM methods is low. The studies conducted in the field of aviation using type-2 Fuzzy methods are as follows: ==== IT2Fs examined route choice using the FTOPSIS method. ==== addressed the issue of supplier performance evaluation using IT2FFAHP and IT2FTOPSIS. ====, improving service quality using MCDM methods was examined. However, no studies have been conducted to investigate aircraft performance using IT2Fs MCDM methods. Although there are studies conducted by using MCDM methods in the aviation literature, it is not seen that the studies used by IT2FAHP and IT2FTOPSIS methods together. Therefore, this study is expected to contribute to the literature by using IT2Fs MCDM methods and focusing on aircraft performance.",Aircraft selection by applying AHP and TOPSIS in interval type-2 fuzzy sets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972030507X,23 September 2020,2020,Research Article,300.0

It is now over 30 years since the first airport privatisation occurred with BAA in the UK in 1987. Since then a significant number of other countries have adopted such policies, albeit that the scope and extent of private participation has varied considerably (====; ====; Airports Council International (====; ====The most recent global data for 2017 (====) shows that of the top 100 busiest airports for passenger traffic, 51% have some type of private sector participation. This drops to 39% for the top 500 busiest airports as it tends to be the larger airports that have experienced such changes. This also means that only around 14% of scheduled commercial airports of all size have some private participation - 614 of around 4300 airports in the world – but this represents 41% of all passengers. Substantial differences exist for world regions. Leading the way is Europe with 43% airports having some private sector involvement (representing 75% of the passenger volume) followed by Asia-Pacific (26% airports; 45% passengers) and Latin America-Caribbean (25% airports; 60% passengers). The share of airports in Africa is only 3% (11% passengers) and is similarly very low in North America (2% airports; 1% passengers) and the Middle East (1% airports; 13% passengers) (====).====While it is widely acknowledged that greater public sector involvement in airports is an important ==== trend, it is not always clear what is mean by terms such as ‘privatisation’ and ‘private sector participation’.

The parameters of our model are estimated by means of a data-driven analysis of two years of radar tracks and flight plans for arrival flights at Tokyo International Airport from 2016 to 2017. Our results show that increasing the capacity with one or two more aircraft in the airspace up to 60 NM around the airport significantly mitigates arrival delays, even when assuming future, increased arrival traffic volumes. The outcomes of this study provide insights into the effectiveness of arrival control strategies and are seen as a means to recommend scenarios to be further analyzed with human-in-the-loop simulations.","The management of aircraft arrivals at airports is central to airport operations. In the United States, Traffic Management Advisory (TMA) (Erzberger and Itoh, 2014) was deployed in air traffic control centers in the 1990's, while its enhanced version, Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) (Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), 2017) and Terminal Sequencing and Spacing (TSAS) (Jane et al., 2013), takes into account future airborne-based operations (Van Tulder, 2017). These systems contribute to sequencing and time-spacing of the arrival traffic consistently in the en-route and terminal airspace areas. In Europe, the on-going SESAR project has facilitated collaboration among European countries and contributed to the development of “Enhanced” Arrival Management (AMAN), which coordinates the arrival time-schedules covering wider ranges of airspace than in the case of conventional operations (European Commission, 2017). In Asia-pacific, targeting strategic air traffic flow management, Long Range Air Traffic Flow Management (LRATFM) has been devised to provide a basis for research into applications beyond current system time-frames (International Civil Aviation Organization, 2018). On-going Japanese research and development on the “Extended” AMAN (E-AMAN) aims to ensure efficient arrival traffic flow at Tokyo International Airport (Itoh et al., 2017). In the E-AMAN scheme, arrival traffic flow control, which coordinates traffic volume under limited airspace capacity and runway throughput, shifts to time-based operations close to the destination airports, which ensures minimum time-spacing between arrivals. An efficient transition from flow control to time-based operations depends on the characteristics of the arrival air traffic flow and its surrounding environment, such as, the runway and airspace capacity, weather conditions, air routes or geographical constraints. One of the most important requirements for the design of future Air Traffic Management (ATM) system is to accommodate an increase of ==== in the global air traffic in the next 20 years, while reducing airport arrival delay (International Civil Aviation Organization, 2016).====Several studies have analyzed the aircraft arrival process at airports by means of queuing theory. The aircraft arrival delay is analyzed in (Bäuerle et al., 2007; DouJohnson et al., 1999; Rue and Rosenshine, 1985; Bolender and Slater, 2000) by employing queuing models focused especially on runway-related delay and capacity constraints. In (Bäuerle et al., 2007), the expected waiting time for aircraft arriving in a single runway is determined using an ==== queuing model. Simple bounds for the expected waiting time are determined by comparison to ==== and ==== models. However, in their case study, the authors do not make use of operational data or compare their results against actual data. In (Rue and Rosenshine, 1985), the arrival of aircraft at Pittsburgh International Airport is modelled as an ==== and ==== queue. The authors determined, using Semi-Markov decision processes, the maximum number of aircraft allowed to land at the airport during peak hours. In (Bolender and Slater, 2000), the expected aircraft arrival delay was estimated by means of ==== queues, which yielded reasonable results when compared with numerical simulation data. Again, no comparative analysis with actual flight data was conducted. In (DouJohnson et al., 1999), the National Airspace System in USA is modelled as a network of aircraft arriving, taxiing and departing queues, where the TRACON sectors are modelled as an ==== queue. A macroscopic view of the impact of ATM technologies and costs is provided. A microscopic analysis of traffic using queuing theory is provided in (Guerouahane et al., 2017; Rahman et al., 133229), where flows of pedestrians are modelled. In (Guerouahane et al., 2017), an ==== queue is proposed to model road traffic. The results show that the model captures well the characteristics of the road traffic. In (Itoh and Mitici, 2019) an ==== queuing model is proposed to analyze air traffic in an airspace around an airport. In (Itoh and Mitici, 2020), a discussion on future air traffic control strategies is provided. In (Rahman et al., 133229), a state dependent ==== queuing model is applied to control the pedestrian flows and the capacity of pedestrian facilities in open outdoor walking environments.====In this study we propose to analyze arrival air traffic under current and novel traffic control strategies using a classical queuing model. In particular, we conduct a macroscopic analysis of the aircraft arrival traffic at an airport using a classical ==== queuing model. We determine the model parameters using 2 years of flight plans and track data at Tokyo International Airport. We first estimate the expected arrival delay under the current tactical arrival management strategy, for increasing aircraft arrival rates. Second, we analyze additional tactical arrival strategies, such as increasing the airspace capacity closer to the airport or adjusting the flight time in specific airspace areas. Our results show that a slight increase in the airspace capacity results in much lower arrival delays than when adjusting the flight times. The outcomes of this study contribute to the design of arrival management systems and control strategies to be used by air traffic controllers at an airport. Equally important, our approach provides insights into the effectiveness of arrival control strategies and is seen as a means to recommend scenarios to be further analyzed with human-in-the-loop simulations.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces air traffic operations at Tokyo International Airport, and characterizes the arrival traffic data recorded in 2016 and 2017. This data analysis supports the models presented in this paper. Section 3 proposes a queue-based modeling approach where the aircraft arrival process is formulated as a ==== queuing model. Based on the data-driven analysis, probability distributions of the inter-arrival time and service time, and the number of service counters are estimated. In Section 4, the ==== queuing model is applied to estimate the aircraft arrival delay time as a function of the distance away from the airport. The estimation results allow us to analyze the relation among arrival rate, airspace capacity, and aircraft waiting time (arrival delay time). Section 5 clarifies efficient arrival control strategies based on the estimation results of arrival traffic delay while increasing arrival ratio and airspace capacity, and adjusting means of service times using the ==== queuing model. Section 6 discusses how this proposed queue-based approach contributes to the design of future operational procedures and technologies, combined with the results of the ==== queuing approach. Additionally, authors’ future works on mathematical modeling of the aircraft arrival process are discussed, as well as further extensions of the study. Finally, Section 7 presents the conclusions of this study and outlines our plans for future work.",Analyzing tactical control strategies for aircraft arrivals at an airport using a queuing model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305214,18 September 2020,2020,Research Article,303.0

One of the most important elements of these courses is a pseudo-pilot (PP) who has active tasks during simulator training. At Eskisehir Technical University (ESTU) PP assignments are made manually to meet the demand of related courses by considering the availability of PP. Even where it is attempted to assign each PP equally in terms of period, personal workloads differ due to the different psychological (mental) and physiological requirements of the simulator tasks. In this study, the PP assignment problem is investigated using mixed-integer programming (MIP). For this purpose, firstly, an equal period assignment to pilots was attempted with a mathematical model, called the Equality of Periods Model (EPM). Then, simulator tasks were weighted using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and an Equality of Workload Model (EWLM) was created based on these weights. Finally, these models were combined to make fair assignments with the Fair Model (FM). The results indicate that the proposed models significantly reduce the differences of workload and working period compared to manual assignment (MA).","Education in the department of air traffic control (ATC) at Eskisehir Technical University (ESTU) has the two aspects of theory and practice. Theory courses are carried out traditionally in classrooms with one lecturer and a group of students while practical courses are carried out using a one-to-one method and consist of an instructor, a real-time simulation environment and pseudo-pilots (PPs). These courses are performed using exercises which are created in a real-time simulation environment, and the duration of each exercise varies between 20 min and 60 min. In all simulator courses, a student needs to communicate with the PP to command all the aircraft which s/he is responsible for controlling. PPs use the same system as the students; they also have an interface for data entry. Fig. 1 shows a simplified diagram of the simulator environment that includes interactions between ATCO trainees, PPs and Instructors.====The PPs give inputs to the simulator via its interface. These inputs are commands given by the ATCO student to separate aircraft safely. There are wide variety of commands such as climb, descend, turn, change of heading, decrease or increase speed, take-off, clearance to land, vacate the runway, handover, pushback, taxi, hold position, join traffic pattern. Normally, the PP is supposed to perform them all with zero mistakes, on time, and neither perform more nor less action than the student commands. It is understandable that more or less action by the PPs during simulator training may affect evaluation negatively, and this puts pressure on the PP to do all commands immediately. This increases the stress level and the workload of the PPs during training and this pressure adversely affects the PPs ability to carry out the tasks.====Since the PP is one of the most important elements of these courses as along with the instructors, the assignment of the PP becomes significant to provide better training during the semester. Hence, it is valuable to investigate the assignment of PPs in terms of workload and working period to maintain the quality of simulator training. PP assignments are made manually at the beginning of the semester. Since the PPs are also research assistants, whose postgraduate education continues, the graduate course schedules of these individuals are taken into consideration when making these assignments. Currently, it is only attempted to assign each PP an equal working period. The distribution of simulator tasks in an equal period cannot mean that they are always distributed fairly due to the different psychological (mental) and physiological requirements of the simulator tasks. Hence, it is important to assign PPs to simulator courses by considering both working period and workload to ensure an equitable division of the duty.",Handling the pseudo pilot assignment problem in air traffic control training by using NASA TLX,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305172,16 September 2020,2020,Research Article,304.0

This flexibility can be exploited to reduce maintenance costs and improve fleet utilisation of an airline. In this paper we introduce and study the Line Maintenance Scheduling Problem (LMSP). The LMSP assigns jobs to available maintenance opportunities, defined by aircraft routes, and sets the starting time for each job. Its objective is to minimise the deviation from this schedule with respect to given due dates for each task, without exceeding resource capacity at the airports at any moment. We formulate the LMSP as a mixed ","Since the rise of commercial aviation in the years following World War II, safety in air travel has undergone an impressive evolution. For instance, the rate of yearly fatal accidents per million flights has dropped from around 10, in the sixties, to 0.05 in the present date (Airbus, 2020). This remarkable achievement would not have been reached without a collective effort and the implementation of very rigorous safety norms regarding aircraft maintenance.====Aircraft maintenance, as essential as it is, represents a big challenge for airlines in terms of costs and planning. Typically, aircraft maintenance costs make up about 10–20% of the costs associated with the operation of fleets of a typical airline (PeriyarSelvam et al., 2013). According to IATA (2019), global maintenance, repair and overhaul expenses in 2018 amounted to $69 billion, with an annual growth rate of 4.1%. Hence, airlines are continually searching for ways to reduce this huge expense, while guaranteeing the airworthiness of their aircraft, and the safety of their passengers.====There are two main types of aircraft maintenance jobs: jobs that must be carried out in scheduled maintenance checks, and jobs that are relatively simpler and can be performed routinely during the ground time of an aircraft. Maintenance jobs of the first type are bundled together in block checks, according to their periodicity and time requirements. For instance, an ‘A’ check is performed every two to three months, and takes the aircraft out of circulation for around six to 24 h, while on the other end of the spectrum ‘D’ checks are carried out every six to ten years, and require grounding an aircraft for several weeks (Deng et al., 2020).====‘‘Line maintenance”, on the other hand, encompasses the execution of any minor maintenance activity on an aircraft right before a scheduled flight to ensure that it is airworthy for the intended flight operation. This may include defect rectification, troubleshooting, aircraft component replacement, general inspections, minor repairs and modifications. Aircraft line maintenance does not require extensive in-depth inspection, dis-assembly and rectification of aircraft and does not generally require hangar space unless weather and other special circumstances dictate. As more maintenance jobs now fall out of notional work blocks for modern aircraft, a better utilisation of the capacity in the line maintenance environment can help improve the efficiency of aircraft maintenance, and help balancing the workload at maintenance bases throughout the peak and trough periods (Hughes, 2006).====Although aircraft line maintenance generally requires neither an extensive investment of elapsed time or manpower for individual maintenance jobs, it contributes significantly to the maintenance cost due to its high frequency of occurrence with associated aircraft down time, skilled labour, materials and spare parts usage (Gupta et al., 2003). What makes line maintenance scheduling different from heavier maintenance scheduling is that the frequent job service requirements must be scheduled in the windows given by aircraft ground time intervals, which may overlap, and which compete for the resources available in the different airports where maintenance jobs are executed. This means that the job assignment to maintenance slots is not enough to determine if a schedule is feasible in terms of resource availability. The stochastic nature of ad hoc aircraft rectifications, the heterogeneity of aircraft fleets, and various cyclic maintenance constraints can make line maintenance scheduling even harder.====Line maintenance schedules are usually designed with the objective of maximising the maintenance yields while satisfying compliance deadlines and resource constraints. Technically, the term task yield refers to the ratio between the average interval of repetition versus the maximum allowed interval for a given task. So, if the objective of an airline was exclusively to save on maintenance costs, a myopic strategy would be to maximise yields and spread maintenance jobs apart in time as much as possible, i.e., to try to program jobs as close to their deadlines as possible. However, this approach would be extremely risky, because it leaves no room for recovering from last-minute disruptions. Although compliance extensions can be obtained in exceptional cases, they come with a compromised airworthiness situation, which may require special considerations, concessions and specific approvals from the airline's quality assurance department and the relevant civil aviation authority of the country. Non-compliance may involve contravention of the Civil Aviation Act or the relevant regulations of a country, and may involve a breach of the condition attached to an airline operating licence or certificate. Moreover, timely maintenance helps preventing aircraft systems to acquire a maintenance condition, similar to the way a human body can acquire a medical condition, which translates into higher maintenance costs in the long run.====To deal with these uncertainties airlines work with safety buffers, defined by a due time associated with each job. The ideal size of these buffers can be determined with the usual techniques used for defining safety stocks in the inventory management literature, and depends on the variability of the operation and the desired level of service to achieve. This way, the objective of the line maintenance problem can be reformulated as scheduling jobs as close to their due times as possible, which translates into minimising the total deviation from the ‘‘ideal” schedule defined by the due dates (or, the total earliness plus tardiness of the scheduled jobs).====Motivated by the importance and the challenging nature of line maintenance planning, we introduce a formal definition and mathematical formulation for the Line Maintenance Scheduling Problem (or just LMSP). Given a flight plan (or, directly, the set of available maintenance opportunities per aircraft), a fleet of aircraft, and a list of maintenance jobs to be carried out for each individual aircraft of this fleet, the objective of the LMSP is to determine when and where each maintenance job should be carried out within a planning horizon in order to minimise total deviation from due dates. The decisions involved in a solution of the LMSP can be classified in two levels: job assignment, and timetabling. On the top level, the job assignment stage decides which jobs are assigned to which available slot (or eventually postponed, if we allow jobs to be non-mandatory). In the timetabling phase, the objective is to set the specific starting times of jobs within their slots. Under this framework, the total deviation of a solution is determined by the job assignment, while the feasibility in terms of resource consumption and availability depends on the timetable, which ties the two decision stages together. Our formulation of the LMSP also considers that certain jobs can be postponed for execution beyond the planning horizon.====To solve the LMSP, we propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation of the problem, and devise and test two different solution algorithms. The first one tackles both levels of the problem in an integrated fashion, while the second one solves the problem sequentially: first it assigns jobs to available maintenance slots, and then it deals with the timetabling decisions. These two approaches pose a trade-off between the quality of the solution they reach (i.e., the total deviation from the ideal schedule) and the time they take to reach a solution. However, as we show later, for real-sized instances the integrated approach is able to find optimal solutions in about ten minutes of execution, which is very reasonable for a tool aimed at aiding a day-to-day decision making process.====This paper is organised as follows. §2 presents a literature review covering maintenance scheduling on different levels. In §3, a mixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed, which solves the complete problem to optimality. Then, §4 describes two solution approaches that are developed to solve the LMSP with short computation time. §5 presents the numerical experiments and benchmark policies used to compare the performance of two proposed solution methods. Results in terms of solution quality and execution times are discussed in §5 as well. Conclusions are then summarised in §6.",Aircraft line maintenance scheduling and optimisation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972030497X,15 September 2020,2020,Research Article,305.0

Our review of current regulatory approaches shows a need for further policy and management response to both manage rapid and efficient drone usage growth, and facilitate innovation (e.g. intraurban package delivery), with one promising strategic response being low altitude airspace management (LAAM) systems for all drone use cases.","Remote technology and automation have been present for centuries, giving human operators safety from harm and enabling new task functionality (increasing capability of individual operations and capacity of the system). Early examples include fireships, a maritime drone, which were used in navies to destroy other ships remotely. In World Wars 1 and 2, airborne drones were used to disrupt airspace above cities, drop ordinance on enemy ==== and as target practice for pilots. Railways have for some time used drone (non-crewed) locomotives to support driver occupied locomotives.====). Though current usage is limited whilst the technology is in the development phase, as they possess significant potential versatility drones may transform the way that logistics services are provided. Their use no doubt will lead to the achievement of new business, social, environmental and other goals (====). However, it also creates a potentially disruptive scenario as their usage expands out of control and causing problems for other parts of the economic system, as illustrated in the rapidly growing literature presented in this paper.====Interestingly, during the COVID-19 crisis drone potential has been further harnessed, using the people free nature of the technology to modify current service delivery to improve safety and capacity levels, including the delivery of face masks to remote islands in Korea and prescription medicines from pharmacies to retirement villages in Florida. It could be argued that COVID-19 has increased technological advancement in many areas and that perhaps drones represent a revolution in how we transport goods and potentially even ourselves (however that is analysis for a future paper).====In that sense, it is important to note that the use of drones in larger commercial applications is also growing (see, e.g. ====), with their deployment in remote work leading to significant cost reductions and capability enhancements (such as in mining, engineering and transport network management contexts and agricultural scanning). Their ability to view large areas at a low cost from altitude provides new viewing aspects and new data acquisition ability (or existing data can be sourced at a large scale at a lower cost) to make decisions and manage operations more effectively. Similarly, airborne photography has entered a new stage of development with operators, both large and small, able to give consumers new imagery that had previously been in the domain of birds only. Besides, the recent spurt of the retail sale of drones for recreational and small-scale commercial purposes has pushed airborne drones into the entertainment space.====However, there is a range of other potential uses. Experience in delivering medical supplies in remote African areas gives a potential preview of their role in urban parcel/package delivery, radically changing the way small deliveries are made in urban areas. Commercial and policymaking efforts are turning to contemplate this future and how airborne drones may need control in such uses. This may have significant impacts, not only on delivery cost but on urban congestion and traffic management issues – should they replace land-based journeys. Being in urban areas, implementation issues will arise that require consideration, given the greater risks involved.====While there have been earlier reviews (e.g. a techno-ethical one, ====This paper reviews the extant literature on the potential implementation of drones into the economic system and specifically how the implementation and ongoing use may be managed. Section ==== then presents our bibliometric results and discusses the issues being reported in the literature and highlights the four main use cases for drones (based on a content analysis of the reviewed papers) that we see being discussed.

Apart from the obvious direct impact on health and mortality, the measures applied to control the spread of the disease caused major disruptions in economic activity that will probably be followed by a long recovery period.

Second, the paper analyses the implications of government support in three dimensions relevant to air ====: competition and liberalisation, airline ownership and control, and environmental sustainability.====Even though the aviation sector is gradually becoming a more competitive and market-driven industry, the role of governments in promoting national interests through interventions in air transport at both national and international levels has not diminished. Aviation is seen by most governments as a strategic sector closely linked with economic development (====), and as a result is directly or indirectly supported across several parts of its value chain. Aviation policies, like other economic policies, reflect a balance between the interests of consumers and the aviation and tourism industries (====). Support can be in the form of selective subsidies to operators, manufacturers, or service providers (====), or of interventions that restrict market access to potential competitors (====) and create monopolistic bottlenecks (====).====The issue of climate change is another area where the Governments' role in the industry has been increasing in recent years. So much so that COVID-19 prompted airline supports in France and Austria contain environmental conditionalities as discussed in Section ==== below. Even if the aviation sector's contribution to the global greenhouse gas emission is rather limited, the sector growth is strong (====; ====). Since 2012, CO====An expression of the importance of connectivity for reasons of national interest as opposed to free market conditions is the widely used public service obligation scheme, which subsidises airline connections to non-profitable destinations (====). The definitions and impacts of subsidies and other forms of support vary considerably depending on the context.

In the crisis, airports need to achieve viability, in the short run through sufficient liquidity, and in the long run, by covering costs. From a public policy viewpoint, price increases in a crisis are argued to be undesirable, as they would further jeopardise the viability of airlines and tourism as well as the wider ==== benefits such as connectivity. The institutional environment of airports differs from airport to airport; some are publicly owned, others are private but regulated, and others face competition. The price response of each (of 6) types of airport is considered, and how policy could respond to keep prices low in the crisis while ensuring longer term viability. Regulated airports could defer price increases until demand had recovered, if regulators insisted they do so. Publicly-owned airports could be directed by governments to keep charges low. Governments might also state that unregulated airports that raised charges could be made subject to price regulation in the future. Competitive airports would be unable to raise charges but this could jeopardise their viability. In this case and others where airports might need financial assistance, assistance could be made conditional on keeping charges low in the crisis.","The institutional environment of airports differs from airport to airport; some are publicly owned, others are private but regulated, and others face competition. The crisis has changed the tasks for the airports. In addition to the efficiency and environmental objectives, they now have the problem of long-term viability. Ideally, they need to achieve these while keeping prices low, avoiding the situation which occurred during the Global Financial Crisis, when many European airports put prices up (====), at the expense of the airlines and passengers, and hindering the recovery. There is also the issue of who is best placed to bear the risks-airports or airlines.====First, though, we summarise the impact of Covid-19 on passenger demand and provide some basic information on airport cost shares.====The data on passenger numbers (see ====) show that the COVID crisis led to unprecedented reductions in passenger numbers, implying a dramatic reduction in revenues not only for airlines but also for airports. The length and impact of the crisis on airports will depend on the containment of the virus and on the effectiveness of the monetary and fiscal stimulus programs.====Demand for air transport services depends on GDP – a five per cent fall in GDP could be expected to result in a 5–10% fall in demand.==== However, Covid-19 has demonstrated the importance of other factors like health and safety, which can affect demand even more dramatically. Most of the fall in air transport which is shown in ==== stems from cross-border travel restrictions imposed by governments to limit the transmission of the virus.==== In the medium term new health and safety requirements at airports will increase costs in the recovery phase.====Airport cost shares depend upon the tasks which the airport handles. In many cases, an airport will contract out the tasks, and an airport which is the workplace for around 20,000 employees may have less than 500 direct employees (this is so for Australian and many US airports). For such an airport, fixed capital costs will be a large proportion of the total. In Europe many airports prefer in-house production. For such airports, ==== will be a smaller proportion of the total. Ceteris paribus, these airports will have higher costs and more commitments (even though they will have some flexibility in the amount of labour they hire).====Aggregating across all member airports (900), ====) elaborated on these data: “Operating expenses comprise about 65 percent of total costs and include staff costs (30–40 percent), contracted services (20–25 percent), utilities (about 7 percent), and rent or concession fees (about 7 percent). Capital costs (on average, 35 percent) mainly comprise depreciation (about 65 percent) and interest payments (about 32 percent).”====The ACI World report (2018) also found for 2016 that 56% of airport revenues derive from aeronautical charges with nearly all the remainder (40%) from non-aeronautical charges.====Insofar as both types of revenue derive from passenger use of an airport, both might be expected to move with traffic.====The following is the Supplementary data to this article:","Covid −19, the collapse in passenger demand and airport charges",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305159,12 September 2020,2020,Research Article,308.0

While air mobility has allowed more passengers to fly to more and remote destinations within a few hours at affordable prices (====; ====; ====), it has also significantly contributed to the risk of spreading diseases worldwide. It has been well known that air transportation plays a critical role in the spread of contagious diseases (====; ====; ====; ====). While all these previous diseases have had terrible and harmful effects on their own, these consequences occurred more directly at the local level. Despite of heavy travel ban restrictions as well as quarantine policies enforced by governments, the COVID-19 outbreak, which is believed to have started around January 2020, quickly spread to almost all countries worldwide. The number of infected cases reached one million in April 2020, surpassed 5.8 million in late May, and reached 23 million in August 2020, with the disease being related to more than 800,000 deaths worldwide (as of August 23rd, 2020).

The metric for this type of social distancing is how many passengers are seated so close to each other as to increase the risk of infection.

That distance influences the health risk involved in passengers and crew members walking down the aisle. Corresponding metrics for both health risks are included in the objective function. To conduct simulation experiments, we define different scenarios distinguishing between the relative level of significance of each type of social distancing. The results suggest the seating assignments that best serve the intention of the scenarios. We also reformulate the initial model to determine seat assignments that maximize the number of passengers boarding an airplane while practicing social distancing among passengers. In the last part of this study, we compare the proposed scenarios with the recommended middle-seat blocking policy presently used by some airlines to keep social distancing among passengers. The results show that the proposed scenarios can provide social distancing among seated passengers similar to the middle-seat blocking policy, while reducing the number of passengers seated close to the aisle of an airplane.","The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in unprecedented measures in terms of travel and socio-economic activities worldwide, while the estimated negative economic effects can be seen in many areas. As a result, the global economy is projected to have a gross domestic product contraction of −3%, worse than the one generated by the 2008–2009 financial crisis, a reduction of the global merchandise trade volume by 13%–32% compared to 2019 and a decline in international tourism monetized with a reduction between USD 330 billion – USD 590 billion compared to 2019, mostly due to the travel restrictions applied in almost 96% of travel destinations (ICAO, 2020).====Airplane transportation is one of the main sectors affected by the coronavirus outbreak due to the both the limitations imposed on international flights in different countries and to the reluctance of passengers to engage in air travel (Taylor, 2020). In a recent study entitled “COVID-19 Air Transport Near Term Impacts and Scenarios” by Fast Future and Future Travel Experience, based on a 16-question survey, completed by 269 industry professionals from 47 countries, supplemented by a series of research and expert interviews, it has been reported that the passengers’ reluctance to fly would be heightened in the COVID-19 period by the confusing protocols used by different countries, airlines and airports (Taylor, 2020). As airline transport is made through enclosed spaces in which a large number of people are fit in, this type of transport has been closely associated with the potential risk of spreading the virus (Vandycke, 2020), producing both social and economic effects because the consumers might be tempted to change their behavior and to seek private means of transport to the detriment of airline transportation. As Iacus et al. (2020) have shown, the air traffic industry has been closely related to the past pandemic outbreaks such as SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2015 (Iacus et al., 2020), while the effects of these pandemic periods have been visible at both regional and global scale. As a result, the airline companies have the duty of ensuring the safety and health of their passengers in these hard times by increasing their trust in this industry which is already significantly affected by the COVID-19 situation. As Vandycke (2020) recently stated, a short-term chaos could bring long-term transformation in the transportation industry (Vandycke, 2020). In this context, the author envisions the end of the “giant planes” and “first class” as airlines need more flexibility in order to provide a higher level of safety for their passengers (Vandycke, 2020). The IATA Medical Advisory Group (IATA, 2020) suggests that airlines take the following measures to ensure passenger safety: social distancing, proper management of the boarding process, limit carry-on luggage, and sequential boarding starting from passengers with seats in the rear of the airplane and window seats.====Social distancing, i.e., reducing interactions between individuals in order to slow down the spread of the virus (De Vos, 2020), has been one of the most discussed measures proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to mitigate the horrendous impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (WHO, 2020). The measures included in the term of “social distancing” feature keeping a sufficient distance among the people, avoiding mass gathering and closing public places (Nguyen et al., 2020), all of them representing an effective non-pharmaceutical approach for limiting the disease transmission (Ferguson et al., 2006). Imposing a social distance measure for airplane passengers is mentioned in a recent report of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which states that “airplane operators should ensure, to the extent possible, physical distancing among passengers” (EASA, 2020). As social distancing in airplane boarding requires both passengers' self-willingness to respect the suggested social distance and a well-designed seat assignment strategy, in this work, we focus on proposing a proper passenger seat assignment to practice social distancing, rather than offering some general safety guidelines to the passengers, as these guidelines are considered known by passengers and passengers’ compliance can be only partially supervised by the airline companies. To be more specific, we formulate a mixed integer programming (MIP) model to assign passengers to seats on an airplane to respect two types of social distancing: keeping the passengers seated far enough away from each other and providing a safe distance between seat assignments and the aisle. The primary goal of this paper is to show how the proposed model can be used to properly assign the passengers to their seats while effectively preserving the social distancing among them.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the next section provides a short literature review on both airplane boarding methods research and optimization techniques used in airplane boarding. Section 3 features the proposed method and underlines the assumptions for passenger assignment and the MIP model formulation. Section 4 provides the numerical simulation on different cases, while accounting for one or two levels of social distancing among seated passengers. An additional discussion is made in Section 4 in relationship to the airlines’ current policy for social distancing. Section 5 concludes the paper and provides some guidelines for further research directions.",Social distancing in airplane seat assignments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720304981,11 September 2020,2020,Research Article,311.0

The methodology encompasses different modules: CCO, standard departing and arriving trajectories extracted from an external database, an ad-hoc algorithm for detecting and solving conflicts, and an ATC-workload model with the inclusion of CCO-task modifications. Monte Carlo simulations evaluates different combinations of these modules. Then, a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate two parameters: the impact of the calibration of the maximum ATC workload and the percentage increase of the CCO tasks on the ATC workload. The methodology is applied to a case study at Palma airport in Spain. Extensive numerical simulations are executed based on the integration of CCOs into the system from 0% to 100%. The integration of CCOs implies the increase of the ATC workload in the Control Tower (TWR) and the reduction in the Approach Control Centre (APP). The sensitivity analysis shows that the decrease in the increase of CCO-task workload barely affects the number of CCOs that can be operated without exceeding the workload limits. Conversely, the reduction of the ATC workload calibration allows the integration of CCOs around 50% in the case of 90% TWR calibration and up to 100% in the case of 80%.","The current Air Transportation System is expected to increase seamless the number of movements throughout the following years. This increase cannot be accommodated without new research, the development and implementation of new technologies and procedures for the future Air Transportation System (Janic, 2014). These needs move forward to the development and implementation of new operational concepts. Regarding path efficiency and environmental impact, Continuous Climb Operations (CCOs), Continuous Cruise Climbs and Continuous Descent Approaches (CDAs) address crucial concepts to the evolution of air traffic. Although these approaches can provide fuel, environmental and economic benefits in specific stages of the flight (Marais et al., 2013), they usually cut off the capacity because the path uncertainty associated and the increase on Air Traffic Control (ATC) workload (Hebly and Visser, 2009; Murdoch et al., 2009; Pérez-Castán et al., 2018).====The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines CCO (ICAO, 2012) as “an aircraft operating technique enabled by airspace design, procedure design and facilitation by Air Traffic Control (ATC), allowing for the execution of a flight profile optimised to the performance of the aircraft”. The integration of CCO should avoid the coexistence with any non-optimal climbing trajectory due to aircraft segregation requirements. Thus, the CCO concept is a step forward in trajectory management since CCOs seek to operate a continuous climbing path without altitude and airspace constraints (Mitchell et al., 2012; Pradines and Pablione, 2007). IFATCA (IFATCA, 2012) presented the main summary of the potential benefits that bring the systematic introduction of CCOs in terms of delay, fuel consumption and pollutants: the average potential fuel savings from CCO range between 6 and 19 kg per departure, with annual CO2 savings around 5.000 kg per high-density airport (McConnachie et al., 2015).====Different studies (Dalmau and Prats, 2015; Ho-Huu et al., 2018; Visser and Hartjes, 2014) assessed the impact of optimised departures regarding fuel consumption, noise and emissions. All the studies shared the potential benefits in economy and environment as a result of continuous climbing at the initial phases of departure operations. However, the crucial issue arises when multiple aircraft in high-density airports climb and descend increasing the complexity of the scenario. The primary problems for the integration of new procedures are capacity and safety (Jacquillat et al., 2017; Simaiakis and Balakrishnan, 2016). Moreover, CDAs underlie the development and integration of CCOs. Previous studies showed that the integration of CDAs in high-density airports was feasible, but it led to a significant reduction in capacity (Alam et al., 2010; Weitz et al., 2005). The reason was that the uncertainties associated with CDAs were so high that the separation must be enlarged to encompass every feasible path (Dalmau and Prats, 2017). Similar results were obtained for CCOs (Pérez-Castán et al., 2019a). Ren and Clarke (2007) developed a theoretical framework to introduce RNAV procedures in Terminal Manoeuvre Areas (TMAs) based on a separation methodology. The study concluded that distance-based separation was inefficient, which is one of the major limitations that would impact on the ATC workload.====The impact on the ATC workload by the introduction of continuous procedures is far from being covered. ATC primary role is to ensure aircraft safety at the same time as an efficient air traffic flow. The ATC workload is directly related to sector capacity; therefore, the primary limitation to introduce more aircraft considering new operational concepts is the ATC workload. There have been a considerable number of investigations into modelling the ATC workload (Brooker, 2003; Corver et al., 2016; Janić, 1997; Mercado-Velasco et al., 2010). Most of them modelled the ATC workload as the sum of different tasks during a period of time. However, few of them provided the quantification of the ATC tasks, which is crucial to develop a common framework on the ATC's workload models.====In this article, the authors develop a model to assess the CCO impact on the ATC workload. The ATC workload model follows the main features of existing models, but new tasks are included to encompass CCO needs. CCO trajectories consist of fuel-optimised paths free of ATC segregation requirements with landing flows. This study aims to analyse how the integration of de-conflicted CCOs on the ground affect the ATC workload on the Control Tower (TWR) and the Approach Control Centre (APP). To ensure statistical values, Monte Carlo simulations are used to analyse random departing and landing schedules according to a complex set of operational features. The sensitivity analysis assesses this issue by modifying the calibration of the maximum TWR workload and by the percentage increase of CCO tasks. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, there is little research considering the impact of CCOs on the ATC workload available in the literature, and this work can provide added value for the future integration of CCOs in high-density scenarios.====The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the problem description, the operational concept and the methodology. Section 3 details the ATC workload model to assess the impact of CCO integration. Section 4 introduces the scenario - Palma airport (Spain) - and the main operational features. Section 5 presents the results and discussion of the ATC workload variation due to CCO integration. The sensitivity analysis that describes how the variation of two variables affecting the ATC workload is presented in section 6.

The most common these events are: bad weather, failures of components of the ATC system supportive facilities and equipment due to different internal and external causes (loss of power supply, fire,==== cyber-attacks====), the industrial actions of ATC staff, terrorist threats and attacks, etc. They all individually or in different combinations may substantively deteriorate the capacity of given ATC sectors, thus requiring application of the mitigating contingency measures. The indicators of ATC operational, economic, environmental, and social performance can be considered to be the ATC controller workload increased due to the increased complexity of air traffic to deal with, the number of aircraft/flights to be handled by the capacity of affected ATC controllers/sectors, the consequent aircraft/flight congestion and delays and related costs, the additional fuel consumption and related emissions of GHG, and eventually increased noise and risk of air traffic incidents/accidents. Comparing the values of these affected indicators of performance with their regular/nominal counterparts can be used for assessing resilience of these affected ATC sectors under given conditions.====The main potentially directly affected actors/stakeholders can be airlines with affected flights and their users - air passengers and freight/cargo shipments - experiencing an unexpected prolongation of their door-to-door trip times. In addition, these are the global and local communities exposed to the additional emissions of GHG, sometimes excessive noise and increased risk of air traffic incidents/accidents. Last, the ATC controllers may generally be exposed to an increased or lack of workload compared to that under regular/nominal operating conditions. .====Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is developing for the first time in the academic sphere a consistent theoretical framework for assessing resilience of the ATC sectors affected by the impact of a given disruptive event. The framework contains the methodology consisting of three set of models: i) generic model of resilience: ii) analytical models of the indicators of performance of the affected ATC sectors; and iii) analytical models of the resilience of affected ATC sectors based on the indicators of performance as the figures-of-merit.====In addition to this introductory section, this paper consists of four other sections. Section 2 describes characteristics of the ATC sectors and the concept of their resilience. Section 3 presents the methodology for assessing the resilience of ATC sectors affected by the impact of a given disruptive event - the large-scale failure of a component of the ATC system supportive facilities and equipment. The methodology is developed respecting the specified practice-close frequency of occurrence and nature of impact of a given disruptive event and the applied mitigation contingency measures for maintaining safety of operations during the impact and afterwards (NATS, 2015; Subotić et al., 2007).

Facilities such as airports have contributed significantly to the global spread of the COVID-19 virus. Therefore, in order to address this challenge, studies on sanitary risk management and the proper application of countermeasures should be carried out. To measure the consequences over passenger flow, simulation modelling has been set up at Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport. Several scenarios using daily traffic data were run in different circumstances. This allowed the development of some assumptions regarding the overall capacity of the airport. The proposed simulations make it possible to calculate the number of passengers to be processed in accordance with the available check-in counters based on the proposed sanitary measures.","The aviation sector has been experiencing an unprecedented crisis since March 2020. Indeed, almost all airports have been paralyzed following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Euro control had announced a significant 88% reduction in the number of flights by May 1, 2020 (====, ====). The flow of international traffic contributed significantly to the spread of the virus worldwide (====). In Europe, for example, it seems that the areas least affected by the virus are those where no international airport is located. One of the main characteristics of COVID-19 is its long incubation period, which currently averages 5.2 days (====). Contagiousness during the incubation period is one of the reasons why COVID19 spreads so widely compared to other viruses, making it extremely difficult to exclude the possibility of asymptomatic passengers passing through the airport (====; ====), international air traffic will experience a significant decline in the order of 44%–80% in the number of international passengers in 2020 compared to 2019. The Airports Council International (ACI) (====) estimates that airports will lose two fifths of their passenger traffic or more than $76 billion in revenues in 2020 compared to the status quo. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) (====), which represents the airlines, estimates that revenue passenger-kilometers will decrease by 48% in 2020 compared to 2019. Over time, economic activity will resume as governments strive to restore economic growth and recover, which will require a resumption of airport activity. However, airports need to be reopened gradually while being aware of the potential risk generated by the hyper mobility experienced so far in order to avoid a second wave of the pandemic. To date, there is no published solution for a passenger flow management system within the framework of the new health constraints. Nevertheless, certain rules and standards are defined by IATA to guarantee the quality requirements of the passenger assistance service in the terminal area, on which we have based our proposals for additional measures in line with sanitary requirements for such a pandemic. Social distancing is one of the main measures agreed, which will affect the capacity of the airport, although the distances recently adopted by some airports make this issue a subject for debate. Accordingly, this study seeks to determine the necessary parameters for passengers distancing in order to minimize the potential spread of the virus without compromising the airport's ability to manage the flow of passengers. Therefore, this study proposes simulations and discussions on the possible effects of these measures and test their applicability.====The proposed solution differs from other passenger flow management systems in that it introduces preventive measures mandated by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as health precautionary measures at airports. This has led us to study the movement of passengers in this context in order to develop a parametric model capable of adjusting the health measures to the expected flow of passengers and also of verifying its usefulness.====It has been decided to carry out the study in the country's busiest and best-equipped terminal, based on statistical data relative to the time of congestion. This is intended to evaluate the actions taken so that it is possible to determine if they have had viable results.====This document proposes a simulation tool to better manage the flow of passengers, as part of an approach that integrates quality of service standards and the new requirements of health regulations within airports.

The results are based on a ==== and support the assumption that statistically significant explanatory variables stem from gravity factors (GDP and an airport competition measure weighted by distance), hub-and-spoke variables and capacity inputs. We find that a composite variable made up by the airport capacity variables – given by the size of the terminal building and the length of runways – and its domestic connections have a positive effect on airport competitiveness. In conclusion, we find that not only well-known demand-side factors, but also supply-side variables – strategic decisions taken by airport management – matter in attracting international flights.","Agglomeration effects hold considerable influence over the location of international hub airports. This means that international flights tend to be allocated to large airports in large metropolitan areas. However, we argue that other factors also drive the decisions of airline companies, as to where to operate their overseas flights, such as competition policies (Wu et al., 2011), local destinations and the airport's infrastructure capacity (Behnen, 2004), overall quality and potential to become a hub airport (Irandu and Rhoades, 2006). This is especially truth in geographically large countries. While spreading out the demand for international flights in more airports may be effective, it also leads to higher operating costs.====This study acknowledges that airline companies’ decisions are based on both demand and supply-side variables. Regarding the latter, investments in airport infrastructure – such as terminal building and runways – are not a consequence of previous demand, but rather qualify the airport to capture a higher level of demand.====The objective of this study is to evaluate the determining factors influencing airline companies to operate international origin-destination (O-D) routes from different Brazilian airports. The scope of the explanatory variables ranges from traditional gravity factors to a hub-and-spoke variable and capacity inputs.

The indications with respect to the present situation concerning COVID-19 are very different, with predictions suggesting that it could take several years for traffic to recover to pre-crisis levels (====).====Early academic analyses of the impact of the pandemic on air travel has included considerations of the dramatic implications for global passenger traffic (====) and the ways in which future demand for air travel among particular consumer groups may be affected (====). Certainly, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the international travel restrictions and dramatic decline in consumer demand that resulted from it, have already had an unprecedented impact on passenger aviation worldwide (see ====). ====). National ‘stay at home’ restrictions combined with the shutdown of large sections of the global economy (including the manufacturing and service sectors) plus individual consumer concerns about contracting the virus, have caused passenger demand to evaporate. Airlines responded to the sudden reduction in reservations, revenues and overcapacity by rationalising their network, cutting services, furloughing staff and/or making staff redundant, placing aircraft into temporary storage, and lobbying national Governments for financial support.====By the end of March 2020, it was estimated that the world's airlines had collectively requested US$300bn in financial support in addition to US$200bn requested by IATA (====). By mid-April 2020, it was reported that, worldwide, 17,000 aircraft (accounting for approximately 64% of the world's total passenger fleet) had been inactive for at least a week and had been placed in temporary storage (====). By early May, airlines and original equipment manufacturers were announcing significant job losses. Virgin Atlantic announced it was cutting almost a third of its UK workforce while General Electric was reported to be considering cutting up to a third (or 13,000 jobs) of its global aviation workforce (====).====In Europe, as the virus began to peak and passenger demand disappeared, airlines responded to the overcapacity by quickly taking aircraft out of service. However, with aircraft parking charges at major European airports often exceeding £200 per hour for the largest airframes, less expensive storage sites were required (see ====). Some aircraft were dispatched to long-established desert storage locations in the US, while others were parked in a more ad-hoc manner wherever space permitted (see ====; ====) or ‘smart parked’ wingtip to wingtip on runways, taxiways and ramps of airports around the world (====).====Mass groundings of passenger aircraft occurred during the 2nd and 3rd week of March and, by Friday April 17, 2020, nearly 5000 passenger aircraft were being stored in 39 countries across the Eurocontrol area (====). Nearly a fifth of these (948) were in the UK with large numbers also stored in Germany (709), France (525) and Turkey (470). Three-figure numbers were also reported in Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Denmark and the Republic of Ireland (====). Interestingly, the location of these aircraft was not static and changed on an almost daily basis as airlines moved their assets between countries as the crisis developed (Ibid, 2020). The sudden need to store large numbers of aircraft for an unknown period of time posed unique and immediate challenges for airlines and airports alike.====In order to safely preserve an aircraft during an indeterminate period of inactivity, it is necessary to place them in a parked condition. This involves ensuring the aircraft is fuelled so that each tank has a minimum of 10% of its capacity (although operators may chose to uplift more to support ground engine and APU running, especially if the aircraft is stored at a location where there is no facility to refuel the aircraft or at a site where fuel hydrants have been temporarily deactivated). The weight not only acts as ballast but also ensures fuel seals and pumps remain adequately lubricated. Aircraft in a parked condition must also be powered down and engines and all external angle of attack and temperature sensors, vents, static ports and probes need to be covered to prevent contamination or ingestion of foreign objects such as dust, sand, insects or birds. Hydraulic and brake systems should also be periodically cycled to keep fluid circulating and aircraft should be secured with chocks rather than the parking brake in case the latter seizes on during long periods of inactivity (====).====Longer periods of inactivity may also require windshields, brakes and landing gear to be covered and protected in accordance with the aircraft manufacturer's recommendations and airline-specific maintenance procedures. However, despite being in a parked condition, aircraft still require a basic level of care and maintenance support. This may include towing the aircraft to rotate the tyres to prevent flat spots, periodic ground engine runs and inspections of air conditioning units, steering and electrical systems. KLM detailed the level of support required for aircraft in its ‘Active Storage Programme’ (see ====) and Virgin Atlantic reported that it was inspecting each of its grounded aircraft once every 7, 14 and 30 days (====). The process of placing an aircraft into parked condition is time consuming. It is estimated that it can take up to 60 h to place an A320 aircraft into parked condition, and a similar length of time to return it to active service (====).====Generally, the longer the period of parking (determined by the intervals stated in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual), the less periodic maintenance intervention is required. Longer term storage generally requires aircraft to be flown to remote locations where third-party MRO (Maintenance and Repair and Overhaul) companies are engaged to place aircraft into ‘deep storage’. This process may involve oil and fuel being drained from the engines and replaced with inhibiting fluids to reduce the need for periodic engine runs.====When deciding where to store their aircraft, airlines have to consider a number of factors. These include, but are not limited to:====The data on aircraft groundings shows that even airlines based largely within one country have adopted very different strategic approaches to storage. Jet2 (a UK charter/low cost carrier) placed all their fleet into storage whereas easyJet and Ryanair retained around 30% of their fleet in active mode and dispersed the rest to their multiple European bases (====). Some of the airframes that are remaining active are being used to maintain a limited degree of air service connectivity. In the UK, for example, even at the peak of the crisis, a limited number of flights continued to operate between Belfast, Dublin, London, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and Scotland. UK full service carriers, meanwhile, prioritised storing larger, older, out of production models, or aircraft which were acquired as the result of take-overs or mergers and which are not aligned with the core fleet and are more expensive to operate. All 7 of Virgin Atlantic's B747-400 fleet and 44 of British Airways ‘Very Large Aircraft’ (which includes A380, B747-400, and B777 models) were parked as of May 1, 2020 (====).====Virgin Atlantic has announced it is retiring its A340-600 and 747–400 fleet (as of mid-May 2020 the former were all at Bournemouth with a new owner while the latter were parked at Manchester). British Airways reportedly parted out one of its older B747-400 models in early May (====) and this pattern is being replicated worldwide. KLM is accelerating the retirement of its B747-400 passenger fleet while, in the US, American Airlines is retiring B767-300 ER aircraft and phasing out A330-200s and E190s while Delta are bringing forward the retirement of their MD-88s/90s (====). Although it is possible that some of these airframes may be converted into freighters (see ====), given the sudden increase in supply of suitable airframes, it is likely that many will not fly again.====The mass global grounding of aircraft not only has major and wide-ranging implications for airlines and their employees but also for airports, air navigation service providers, maintenance contractors, third party handling agents and all the other sectors of the global economy (including international business travel and tourism) which rely on the provision of quick and efficient air services. While much of the focus of the crisis on aviation to date has understandably been on the disruption to passengers, loss of employment, dislocation of tourists, and financial impact on airlines (and to a lesser extent, perhaps, airports), the aim of this paper is to investigate the extent of grounded aircraft and explore the challenges, from an airfield operations perspective, of resuming flights post-COVID.

A limiting factor toward traffic management is the roadway network and system to move individuals into, out of, and around the urbanized area. Automobiles, buses, trains and subways are some platforms that currently exist; however, some cities offer more alternatives than others. Previous research has indicated that the densely populated urban and city environment provides a higher likelihood of willingness to accept new innovative technology such as driverless cars (Liljamo et al., 2018; Rogers, 2003). A relatively underutilized aspect of urban transportation would be to use the sky, although this space is currently restricted primarily to helicopter traffic which usually is cost-prohibitive for most individuals. However, the announcement of a new form of transportation may provide a more viable alternative to those who live in urban areas.====Volocopter announced in 2018 their intention to deploy autonomous air taxis for testing in Singapore in the second half of 2019 (Holt, 2018). These aircraft would be primarily two-to-four-seat autonomous aircraft that would serve as an air taxi service in urbanized areas. This technology offers the potential to revamp the urban transportation market. However, an existing gap in the literature exists surrounding whether or not consumers would actually fly in an autonomous air taxi. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the type of passenger who may be willing to ride on an autonomous air taxi. The study was conducted in two stages. The first stage was designed to generate a prediction equation and the second to provide validation and ensure model fit. By showing model fit, we can be confident that the regression equation is not only a descriptive model of the previous data, but also a predictive model of future data.

Airport performance is evaluated from the process level (i.e. operational processes providing aeronautical service and financial processes providing commercial service) to the airport level using the Network ==== with actual and forecasted data from the grey model. Results indicate that HKG has been and will be efficient for the entire study period. There is an observed trend of an overall efficiency decrease during the forecast period of 2018–2021. This study classifies operationally efficient airports (PEK, HND, and XMN) and financially efficient airports (HAK, ICN, and DEL). Mainland Chinese airports show significantly higher operational efficiency than financial efficiency, and lower rankings in overall efficiency. It is expected that mainland Chinese airports will soon develop beyond the transportation center, possibly towards the aerotropolis, balancing economic, social, and environmental aspects for sustainable development. This study helps airport management to evaluate sustainable development strategies by assessing current and near future conditions affecting sustainability.","Rapid economic development in Asia has spurred the development of the Asian civil aviation industry. Air transport demand in Asia is expected to grow rapidly for the next 20 years, supported by the region's robust economic growth and expanding middle-class, shifting the global aviation's center to Asia (Airbus, 2018; Boeing, 2018; Embraer, 2018; IATA, 2018). In particular, China will experience a huge surge in air traffic volume, becoming the world's largest aviation market in the mid-2020s (Boeing, 2018; IATA, 2018; ACI, 2018). To meet demand, China will have more than 260 airports by 2020 according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (2018). Still, International Air Transport Association (IATA) warns of an infrastructure crisis from airports and air traffic control not being able to meet the forecasted demand and emphasizes sustainable airport development. In fact, India, whose air passenger traffic is forecasted to triple by 2037, lacks sufficient airports to keep up (IATA, 2018). Hence, it is imperative to examine airport performance forecasts to help airports improve efficiency and plan strategically for sustainability.====Airport performance evaluation has been widely studied, but a consensus on how to correctly evaluate and rank airports has not yet been reached. Iyer and Jain (2019) pointed out that evaluation results from the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) were not actively utilized in practice to improve airport performance. An airport is a system where providers and users of air transportation service meet and conduct their business. Running an airport is identical to running other companies from the perspective of a corporate ethos (Wang, 2004). The DEA tends to work like a black box (Storto, 2018), not revealing how inputs and outputs interact within the system, making it difficult for airport authorities to understand the factors leading to inefficiencies that need to be addressed (Tone and Tsutsui, 2009; Tsui et al., 2014a). With this in mind, researchers proposed the Network DEA model, which deconstructs airport efficiency into a number of subsystem efficiencies (Lozano et al., 2013; Kao and Hwang, 2014; Maghbouli et al., 2014; Yu, 2010; Liu, 2016, 2017; Olfat et al., 2016; Storto, 2018; Kalhor and Matin, 2018; Iyer and Jain, 2019). Mahmoudi et al. (2020) argued that the Network DEA was one of the most useful methods of analyzing performance and helping to enhance the sustainable development of transportation systems.====In previous airport forecast studies, researchers focused on forecasting processed passengers and cargo, two important indicators of airport operational performance (Andreoni and Postorino, 2006; Abdelghany and Guzhva, 2010; Tsui et al., 2014b; Wang and Hurr, 2017; Dantas et al., 2017; Nieto and Carmona-Benitez, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2020). They used traditional and modified forecast methods based on time series data or combination of methods. Most of the methods needed a large volume of past data to forecast with minimal errors. However, the Asian airport industry has developed quickly in recent years, so a long historical time series data will produce inaccurate forecasts. In this paper, we use the grey model because it works better with small samples. The grey model generates and develops a given limited information pool to provide a correct forecast (Deng, 1982). We believe that our choice of model is better suited for the short time series data we are interested in (as few as four years) to forecast the future state of the airport system.====Olfat et al. (2016) incorporated sustainability into analyzing airport performance in Iran applying a Fuzzy Dynamic Network DEA. They deconstructed the airport system into three nodes (i.e., airport, community, and passengers) and used the fuzzy approach to reduce the inevitable vagueness in the variables related to sustainability. They chose a dynamic approach with two six-month time scales, that they called the New Year Holiday and Normal. With scant literature connecting airport performance to sustainable development, we attempt to add to the literature by evaluating airport performance with actual and forecasted data to help plan airport sustainability and establish sustainable airport development strategies. Our paper differs from previous studies in several ways. We choose sustainability indicators from Global Reporting Initiatives (2009, 2011) as inputs and outputs. We develop our forecast by applying the grey model, which works well with limited time-series data, instead of taking a limited dynamic approach. As we deconstruct the airport system, we modify Liu (2016)'s approach instead of following Olfat et al. (2016)'s unconventional three nodes. Liu (2016) first introduced the commercial services subsystem in addition to aeronautical services in the airport Network DEA literature. We classify the two sub-processes as operational and financial. An airport provides aeronautical services in their operational processes and commercial services in their financial processes. Aeronautical services refer to all indispensable operational services and traffic processing services, including aircraft landings and take-offs. They also refer to all passenger-related services in the airport, as well as cargo processing services, ground support services, and safety/security/emergency services. Commercial services usually include franchise-based business and self-operations, including ground handling agent services provided for airlines, in-flight catering services, duty free, retail shops, restaurants, information processing services and catering services in the terminals, the leasing of airport space inside and outside the terminals, the provision of goods warehousing, and car parking services. Liu (2016) used processed passengers and processed cargo as commercial service outputs. We find this choice of operational indicators for commercial service outputs inappropriate, and we select airport total revenues and net income, sustainability indicators to assess direct economic value generated (Global Reporting Initiatives, 2011), as financial sub-process outputs.====This study evaluates the current and future airport performance of twelve representative air transport hubs in East, South-east and South Asia: Beijing Capital (PEK), Shanghai Pudong (PVG), Guangzhou Baiyun (CAN), Shenzhen Bao'an (SZX), Shanghai Hongqiao (SHA), Xiamen Gaoqi (XMN), Haikou Meilan (HAK), Hong Kong (HKG), Seoul Incheon (ICN), Singapore Changi (SIN), Indira Ghandi (DEL), and Tokyo Haneda (HND). This includes eight airports in China, one in Japan, one in South Korea, one in India and one in Singapore. We first forecast the sustainability indicators selected for the Network DEA with the grey model. We then evaluate the overall, operational (aeronautical) and financial (commercial) subsystem performance of the airports from 2014 to 2021 applying the Network DEA. Recent studies in airport performance evaluation have attended to the changes in efficiency in Asian airports (Wang and Hurr, 2017; Fung et al., 2008a, Fung et al., 2008b; Yu et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2014). However, there is no research to our knowledge that forecasts and evaluates disaggregated airport service systems to analyze the causes of inefficiencies in sub-processes for sustainable development. This study also contributes to the sustainable airport development literature by investigating Asian, particularly Chinese, airports where the need is urgent whereas most studies have focused on European airports where awareness around sustainability is high (Longhurst et al., 1996; Kaszewski and Sheate, 2004; Upham and Mills, 2005; Oto et al., 2012; Skouloudis et al., 2012; Koç and Durmaz, 2015). This study aims to provide effective information for airport management to plan competitive sustainability strategies and take countermeasures to improve inefficiencies in the subsystem.====The results suggest that airports focus on strategizing different service products based on their market characteristics and sustainability plans. Mainland Chinese airports (except HAK) show significantly higher operational efficiency than financial efficiency, and they have lower rankings in overall efficiency. This is explained via the emphasis that mainland Chinese airports place on construction hubs to improve aeronautical operation capabilities to cater to sharply increasing air transport demand. ICN, SIN, and DEL emphasize the development of commercial services by innovating service products and striving to improve the passenger service experience. It is expected that mainland Chinese airports will soon develop beyond transportation centers, possibly towards the aerotropolis, balancing economic, social, and environmental aspects for sustainable development.====The remainder of the study is structured as follows. The literature review is followed by an introduction to the methodology and dataset used in this study. The results are then discussed before we conclude and offer implications.",Sustainable airport development with performance evaluation forecasts: A case study of 12 Asian airports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305081,31 August 2020,2020,Research Article,320.0

International airports are important driving forces for Southeast Asia countries' economies. Therefore, the competitive ability of these airports is very essential in terms of development and competitiveness within the region. This paper investigates the capabilities of these airports by a two-stage approach. The strengths and weaknesses of each Southeast Asia airport are evaluated by ==== – Slack-Based Measurement (DEA-SBM) in the first stage. This is a non-parametric approach to measure the efficiency of 9 major airports in the area including Changi Airport (Singapore), Suvarnabhumi Airport (Thailand), Kuala Lumpur Airport (Malaysia), Soekarno Hatta Airport (Indonesia), Ninoy Aquino Airport (the Philippines), Noi Bai Airport, Tan Son Nhat Airport (Vietnam) and Guangzhou Baiyun Airport (China), Hong Kong Airport (Hong Kong). In the second stage, Tobit regression is used to estimate the influence of multiple factors toward the efficiency of each airport. By generalizing and comparing two stages, the analysis allows us to evaluate each airport's efficiency in seven years, as well as the impact of multiple factors in one airport's performance. The implications for improvement are also obtained and discussed.","The economy of the Asia-Pacific region, especially China and Southeast Asia, is expanding rapidly with the increasing demand for air transport services (Burghouwt et al., 2009). Multiple factors have encouraged the rising of air transport demand in the region, for example, “Open Sky” policy, privatization of the airport's governance structure, dramatic economic development. (Park, 2003; Zhang, 2003; Oum and Yu, 2004; Williams, 2006; Yang et al., 2008). IATA forecasts passenger growth for air demand will be highest in the Asia-Pacific region for the next decades, which has an average growth rate of 4.7% by 2035 with an extra 1.8 billion annual passengers and overall market size of 3.1 billion. Indonesia and Vietnam will be among the top five fastest-growing markets in terms of additional passengers per year while China ranks the first (IATA , 2016). In recent years, the airline industry is becoming more and more important driving force for the national economy in general and the logistics in particular. Among the industry, international airports contribute a significant amount to the health of a country's economy (Brueckner, 2003; Green, 2007).====The governments of Southeast Asia countries have invested tremendously in airports' infrastructures and facilities to catch up with high forecasted air transport demand (O'Connor, 1995; Karim et al., 2003). Nevertheless, they are also under pressure on the competition for air traffic demand; as the consequence, the efficiency of airports was identified as a major airport management issue (Talley, 1983; Forsyth, 2003). There also is a greater interest in improving airport's efficiency in the region, such as growing airport capacity, drawing attention to airport's profit as well as regional hub formation in anticipation of liberalization (Lin and Hong, 2006; Lam et al., 2009). That is why the competitive abilities of these airports are very essential in terms of development and competitiveness within the region. This paper shares the same interest as of papers by Lam et al. (2009), Ha et al. (2010), Yang (2010a,b) and Tsui et al. (2014b) in assessing the operational efficiency of Asia-Pacific, particularly Southeast Asia, airports and identifying the reason of variation in airport efficiencies.====This study investigates the capabilities which airports have had to gain competitive advantages, achieved by using a two-stage approach. The two-stage approach has been used to evaluate airports' performance in numerous studies, such as Gillen and Lall (1997), Pels et al. (2001, 2003), Abbott and Wu (2002), Barros and Sampaio (2004), Pathomsiri et al. (2008), Malighetti et al. (2007), Yuen and Zhang (2009), Peremal and Serebrisky (2012) and Tsui et al. (2014b). In the first stage, Data Envelopment Analysis – Slack-Based Measurement (DEA-SBM) Super Efficiency model will be chosen to evaluate the efficiency score for each Southeast Asian airport. DEA is a non-parametric approach which can handle multiple input and output and it has been widely utilized to measure airports’ efficiency by many scholars (Gillen and Lall, 1997; Abbott and Wu, 2002; Fernandes and Pacheco, 2002; Bazargan and Vasigh, 2003; Pels et al., 2003; Barros and Dieke, 2007; De Nicola et al., 2013; Ahn and Min, 2014). The SBM model was also used by Tsui et al. (2014a) to investigate productivity changes and efficiency of 11 New Zealand airports from 2010 to 2012. By applying DEA-SBM Super Efficiency on the panel data collected through seven years, the analysis enables us to assess not only the productivity of each airport in the period, but also input excesses and output shortfalls of the inefficient airport compared to the best practices in the region. It also ranks the best practice among sample airports by assigning the efficiency score over unity.====In the second stage, Tobit regression analysis will be implemented to measure the effects of multiple factors on airport efficiency. These are managerial and operational factors such as governance structure (privatized or government-owned), airport characteristics (capabilities and outcomes), user impact, and competition. A better knowledge of the variables impacting airport efficiency can provide airport operators and decision-makers with insights into how to enhance airport efficiency by benchmarking; that is, this would help to compare airport efficiency with its peers in the same area and enhance its operations. The combination of a first-stage DEA analysis and a second-stage Tobit regression has been a common approach of defining such relevant determinants. This two-stage approach has been used by many scholars in airport efficiency studies, for example, Gillen and Lall (1997), Pels et al. (2001), Abbott and Wu (2002), Pels et al. (2003), Barros and Sampaio (2004), Yuen and Zhang (2009), and Ha et al. (2013).====The sample airports are seven major Southeast Asian airports and two East Asian airports including Changi Airport (Singapore), Suvarnabhumi Airport (Thailand), Kuala Lumpur Airport (Malaysia), Soekarno Hatta Airport (Indonesia), Ninoy Aquino Airport (the Philippines), Noi Bai Airport, Tan Son Nhat Airport (Vietnam) and Guangzhou Baiyun Airport (China), Hong Kong Airport (Hong Kong). They are direct competitors in the area who all have their catchment area of over 10 million inhabitants within a 3-h-flight radius. There were only a few papers investigated the performance of Southeast Asian airports, especially in the regional context. Besides the biggest hubs commonly being the subjects to study that are Singapore's Changi, Thailand's Suvarnabhumi, and Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur, the other airports in the area are often omitted in other studies. We could only assume that it is because of the data unavailability and lack of information. Indeed, the data for some airports in several countries, e.g. Vietnam and the Philippines, is really difficult to get. Hence, this is one of only a few papers investigating Southeast Asian airports' efficiency, so we think it could have a good benchmarking significance to include other widely recognized airports. The two airports of China, especially Hong Kong, are closely related to the South East Asia aviation market and they are direct international rivals to some extent. Therefore, we think the inclusion of those two is worth the comparison and benchmarking. The implication for improvements to inefficient airports is also obtained and discussed.====Firstly, the paper aims to provide a broad overview of the approaches that airports have embraced to gain competitive advantages. This purpose can be done by performing the competitive analysis of an airport and assessing the level of impact that the factors have on an airport's efficiency.====After determining the relevance of these factors, then we consider which strategy airports have chosen to pursue and what factors among these stated above have the most impact on creating the competitive advantages of the region's leading airports.====Lastly, the implications will be drawn from the result obtained from the analysis and suggest some efficient governance mechanism for the decision-maker to improve the efficiency of the airport and policies to make it becomes one of the international hubs in the years to come.====This research's target will be the analysis of the competitive factors of the most successful international airport within the Southeast Asia area and will give the implication to enhance airport performance.",Comparative analysis of efficiency for major Southeast Asia airports: A two-stage approach,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720304828,30 August 2020,2020,Research Article,321.0

As such, the industry kept growing and operated as many as 38 million scheduled commercial flights and carried 4.3 billion passengers in 2018 (====), supporting 65.5 million jobs globally, including 10.5 million airport and airline staff, and $2.7 trillion in world economic activity in 2019 (====). However, since early 2020, the aviation industry is facing its perhaps greatest challenge ever as it is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic (====Similar to SARS, COVID-19 is an airborne disease that can be transmitted rapidly among people (====). As of July 30, 2020, the number of reported cases has exceeded 18 million with approximately 694,715 deaths announced (====). The experience with previous outbreaks tells us, that they usually have direct and serious negative effects on both human health and national economies (====; ====) with the air transport industry at the center of the storm (e.g. ====), as it derives from human and freight mobility, thus not only depending on such but potentially also causing the disease to spread regionally including to remote areas (====). It is hence no surprise that the early evidence suggests significant impact of COVID-19 on the aviation sector, with ==== reporting that the number of flights decreased by 87% in April compared to the same period of the previous year and our own analysis of OAG and CAPA data showing that some large airports and routes have come to a near standstill in May 2020. On that basis, ==== predicts that the global air transport industry could lose $ 314 billion in passenger income in 2020 pointing to the impact of COVID-19 being much more severe than the SARS epidemic that caused an 8% annual decrease in Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPKs) (====). Before that background, in this paper we aim to review the extant literature to see what lessons have been learned from previous pandemics and crises as we argue that the industry will need any advice it can to survive the impact of COVID-19 however long it may last.====Significant events such as COVID-19 has been used in the past for special issues and bibliometric review analysis in the tourism context (====) but not for aviation. In this paper we aim to retrospectively evaluate the evolution of the air transport discipline right up to the COVID-19 outbreak through the ==== (JATM), the main scholarly air transportation journal globally. The main motivation behind performing this bibliometric analysis on JATM is to understand the evolution of the journal, its importance in the field of air transport management, any lessons that can be learned from its papers in terms of strategies for handling pandemics in the aviation context and finally any guidance based on history on who might likely be the institutions and authors that we will look for in terms of reference to strategies for the post-COVID-19 era. As bibliometric review analysis has not yet been widely published and generally accepted in JATM, COVID-19 as a great motivation and theme for finally reviewing the JATM literature in such an innovative manner. ==== state that scholarly journals contain clues to reflect the development of a field or industry. In this sense, we regard JATM as an important scholarly resource that reflects the development of the air transport industry. When we did a quick search with the keyword “Air Transport” in the Web of Science (WOS) database we found that most of the results were originated from and associated with JATM which provides additional support for this notion. Considering this, our study seeks an answer to the following research question: What can we in a systematic manner learn from the extant JATM literature in terms of the future of aviation management transitioning out of and post-COVID-19 or perhaps for preparing and managing potential future pandemics (e.g. COVID-21)?====In light of this question, the following sub-questions are also being inquired in this study:====To answer these questions, the entirety of JATM literature pre COVID-19 is analyzed covering the 2001–2019 period.

The rapidly growing industry has made fundamental changes in the study of accidents in the airports, creating more potential risk and complex safety issues. The ground handling of an aircraft during a turnaround time on the ramp is a complex and busy activity. It deals with diversity of tasks and equipment which are performed simultaneously to reduce ground time and thus to increase productivity. Several types of hazards found in various settings today are dependent on the working conditions. Ground handling workers could be out in the heat for too long or could be exposed to significant levels of noise at the airside or could be lifting and moving heavy bags and equipment all day. Frequent hazards or other potential risks contributed to the increase of ground-related occurrences in Malaysia's international airports in the past few years. These accidents or near misses still occur, even though work settings can be manipulated to control hazards and avoid unnecessary human suffering or death.

Several governments issued restrictions on inbound flights to mitigate such risk. But with the pandemic controlled in many countries, some decide to reopen the economy by relaxing the international air travel bans. As the virus has still been prevailing in many regions, this relaxation raises the alarm to import overseas cases and results in the revival of local pandemic. This study proposes a risk index to measure one country's imported case risk from inbound international flights. The index combines both daily dynamic international air connectivity data and the updated global COVID-19 data. It can measure the risk at the country, province and even specific route level. The proposed index was applied to China, which is the first country to experience and control COVID-19 pandemic while later becoming exposed to high imported case risk after the epidemic centers switched to Europe and the US afterward. The calculated risk indexes for each Chinese province or region show both spatial and temporal patterns from January to April 2020. It is found that China's strict restriction on inbound flights since March 26 was very effective to cut the imported case risk by half than doing nothing. But the overall index level kept rising because of the deteriorating pandemic conditions around the world. Hong Kong and Taiwan are the regions facing the highest imported case risk due to their superior international air connectivity and looser restriction on inbound flights. Shandong Province had the highest risk in February and early March due to its well-developed air connectivity with South Korea and Japan when the pandemic peaked in these two countries. Since mid-March, the imported case risk from Europe and the US dramatically increased. Last, we discuss policy implications for the relevant stakeholders to use our index to dynamically adjust the international air travel restrictions. This risk index can also be applied to other contexts and countries to relax restrictions on particular low-risk routes while still restricting the high-risk ones. This would balance the essential air travels need and the requirement to minimize the imported case risk.","With the improvement of transportation infrastructure and the reduction in travel cost around the world, international travels, especially by air, have dramatically increased. In 2018, the global air passenger travel has reached 8.3 trillion revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) (====). The global RPKs have kept an average annual 6% growth since 2010. Thanks to the globalization and increasing liberalization of bilateral air service agreements (ASAs), the international airline network and air passenger have been expanded dramatically (====; ====). China has been the world's second largest airline market since 2005 (====). In 2018, the market served 1.27 billion passenger travels, with 60 airlines, 3639 transport aircraft, 4945 regular flight routes, 230 domestic cities with regular flights (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan), operating flights to 165 cities in 65 countries (Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), 2018). Such domestic and international air connectivity allows people to travel around the world easily, stimulating trade and people-to-people exchanges. But it may also facilitate infectious disease to spread rapidly around the world. International air travel has acted as important media to contribute to fast spread of several pandemics in the past, for example the SARS in 2013 and H1N1 in 2009 (====; ====; ====).====The first COVID-19 case was recorded in Wuhan China on December 9, 2019 (====) . The virus then quickly spread to the rest of China in January, and then the rest of world has started to report an increasing number of cases. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a Public Emergency of International Concern (PEIC). On March 11, 2020, Dr. Ghebreyesus, the Director of WHO, announced that the COVID-19 has constituted a global pandemic. As of July 20, 2020, there were over 14.5 million confirmed cases in 188 countries and regions (====).====Since there have been no effective drugs or vaccines available, restricting cross-border people flow and imposing strict social distance requirement or quarantine rules are the only ways to contain COVID-19 spread domestically and globally (====). For example, China has quickly locked down Wuhan and the surrounding regions since January 23, suspending all intra-city public transit, and blocked all inter-city and international travels between Wuhan and other regions. Other Chinese cities also responded actively, banning inter-provincial travels and cutting inbound flights. With many earliest overseas confirmed cases reporting Wuhan travel history, China and other countries greatly reduced international flights to China and imposed strict inspections on Chinese flights. Many airlines also voluntarily canceled most of their flights with China even before their governments formally responded to mitigate virus spread risk, including British Airways, Lufthansa, Air Canada, etc.====Thanks to the government's strict quarantine and case tracing measures, the pandemic in China has been controlled since early March. The hospitalized cases have dropped from 58,090 in mid-February to less than 20,000 at the end of March. On April 8, 2020, Wuhan reopened after more than 10 weeks in lockdown. Air and train services have resumed. However, COVID-19 has quickly spread globally, leading to a serious pandemic in Europe and then North America. The epidemic centers are thus switched from China to these two regions, which in turn makes China to be exposed to high imported case risk via its international air connectivity. In particular, China reported more than 300 imported cases from other countries, with about 100 cases confirmed at Beijing airport, where the largest amount of direct overseas flights operated. Thus, to minimize such imported case risk, since March 29, CAAC has promulgated the “one-airline, one-country, one-flight-per-week policy” (CAAC, 2020). That is, only one airline from China or the foreign country is allowed to operate the route between two countries; One route can only have only one flight per week; China only maintains direct flights to one destination of each foreign country. In addition, CAAC launched a comprehensive inspection and quarantine procedure for the inbound airline passengers.====Now, many countries consider reopening the economy and relaxing the international travel ban. For example, more than forty states in the US decided to open up in May and several European countries designed multiple-phase reopening plans, which have been implemented since early May. However, the pandemic has not been well controlled in many countries, such that the aggressive relaxation of international air travels restrictions would inevitably bring about high imported case risk to other countries. This could result in a revival of pandemic in many places where the COVID-19 spread has been initially controlled. Thus, before fully removing the international air travel ban, it is important for the government to comprehensively evaluate the imported case risk, and design corresponding control measures on inbound flights.====This study thus aims to propose an index to evaluate the imported case risk of COVID-19 through international air travel. Specifically, we use the Chinese data to construct such an index in order to measure the imported case risk faced by each Chinese province. The index explicitly accounts for the international air connectivity between China and the foreign countries, and also the detailed pandemic data in each foreign country. The risk index is calculated for each Chinese province on a daily basis from January 1 to April 16, 2020. Both the spatial and temporal patterns of the imported case risk can be examined in detail. Moreover, we can also evaluate how such risk is affected by the government's restriction on international air travel and the dynamic change in global pandemic development in each foreign country.====Such a risk index has important policy implications. The policymaker can apply this index to dynamically monitor and adjust its air travel restrictions with each foreign country. For example, they can consider relaxing the air travel restriction and resuming air connectivity with those low imported risk regions, but probably further tightening or lengthening the duration of the restrictions with those high imported risk regions. With more and more countries succeeding in controlling the domestic pandemic, such imported case risk index can be applied in more contexts to provide in-advance alert and also suggest a more effective strategy to gradually lift international air travel bans, while minimizing the imported case risk and resultant pandemic revival.====The paper is organized as follows. Section ==== reviews the related recent studies on the interrelationship between international air travel and COVID-19 global spread. In Section ====, we combine the real-time data of global flights with the dynamic global COVID-19 pandemic data to construct an index measuring imported case risk for each country with which China has air connection. Section ==== discusses the results of the index calculation and tries to distinguish the patterns from temporal, spatial, source, and route distribution perspectives, respectively. The policy implications are also discussed in this section.

The results demonstrate that airline stock returns decline more significantly than the market returns after three major COVID-19 announcements were made. Overall, investors react differently during the three selected events. The strongest overreaction is noted in the post-event period of the World Health Organization's and President Trump's official announcements. Moreover, the findings confirm that traders in Western countries are more responsive to recent information than the rest of the world. The findings call for immediate policy designs in order to alleviate the impact of the pandemic in the airline ==== around the globe.","The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as the newest global risk has disrupted business operations in all ====. The airline industry is one of the first industries that was affected from the event because the disease is easily passed among people. To date, there is no official medical treatment for the disease, causing a tremendous panic for world citizens. Thus, governments around the world have prohibited cross-country transportation. The market value of the airline business has shrunk since then. Ultimately, this incident motivates us to study the impact of COVID-19 on the performance of the airline industry around the world.====Similar events can be seen in the catastrophic shocks from airline disasters (====), the September 11, 2001 attacks (====), and the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on airline stocks (====). A recent study documents the impact of COVID-19 on employment in the airline industry (====), but the impact of the COVID-19 on airline stock prices has not yet been investigated. In order to fill this gap, we aim to examine the airline stock returns during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.====Although the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first COVID-19 infected case in China on December 31, 2019 (====), we consider three major dates related to COVID-19: (1) the first infected case outside China reported in Thailand (January 13, 2020); (2) the outbreak in Italy (February 21, 2020); and (3) the declaration by WHO on the global pandemic outbreak and the announcement of the U.S. ban on travelers from 26 European countries (March 11, 2020) (====). We select these three dates because they demonstrate important steps regarding the uncontrolled COVID-19 infection.====We employ event study methodology in order to investigate the impact of COVID-19 official press releases on airline stock returns. Fifty-two listed airline stocks covering all continents are included in the study. The first event does not show a significant drop in cumulative abnormal returns, reflecting an underreaction to the severity of COVID-19. However, the situation is reversed in the subsequent two events, showing a huge decline in global airline stock prices. This in turn indicates the overreaction of stock market investors. Our findings support ==== and ====, who document that the COVID-19 outbreak economically affects stock returns. Moreover, traders in Western countries seem to absorb information faster than those in the other regions.====This study contributes to prior literature on catastrophes in the airline business. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to explore the impact of this unprecedented event on this sector.

This concern is exacerbated during times of immense stress brought about by exogenous shocks. In this paper, we analyze the preparedness of U.S. commercial airline management teams to the largest systematic exogenous shock to date, namely the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 and 2020. We do this by underpinning the paper with theory on environmental scanning and managerial dysfunction and then documenting the signals and actions of management around multiple public health scares. These include the SARS outbreak, the ==== outbreak and the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results, based off of corporate filings with the SEC, is that airline management had multiple “dry runs” before the COVID-19 outbreak that should have lead them to prepare for financially catastrophic scenarios such as the one observed in 2020. Instead, management teams failed to learn from these, and other, prior shocks. Instead, they focused on other, less serious threats while diffusing their financial buffers through dividends and share buybacks.","It could be argued that management's top priority is to monitor the firm's external environment to gather information for its next round of strategic decision-making. This concept, known as environmental scanning (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1990), separates the top management team (TMT) from less senior leaders, who may be working within narrower division parameters (i.e. siloes). A difficult part of the scanning function is in picking external information that signals relevant data to act on, while avoiding noisy information that may not be germane to corporate strategy (Jeng, 2016). This information comes from different contexts that can be decompartmentalized in alternate ways. In a dichotomous view of these contexts, one could label the information macro-external or micro-external.====Macro-external information is broad in nature and, therefore, less idiosyncratic to either the focal firm or its primary market. Micro-external information is more specific in nature and, therefore, more directly affects the firm and/or its primary market (Brown, 2017). For example, macro-external information includes economic factors at the national or international level, whereas micro-external information includes factors closer to the industry in which the firm competes. Another factor that distinguishes these two environments is the ease or cost of obtaining information worthy of being incorporated into managerial decision-making. Macro-external information is both easy to gather and generally costless, while micro-external information is both difficult and costly to obtain. Ironically, it is the former information type that many firms have failed to gather and disseminate, leading to corporate decline or failure (Blengini and Heo, 2020).====In addition to gathering and interpreting current macro-external information, management is responsible for maintaining and utilizing historical knowledge of macro-external events (Pryor, Holmes, Webb and Ligouri, 2019). An explanation of the difference between these sets of activities is as follows. Current macro information may include economic factors such as currency fluctuations. As such, if the focal firm operates in different monetary environments, knowing the direction and magnitude of these fluctuations is critical. Similarly, knowing the historical trends of currency fluctuations and their effects on the focal firm's business is also crucial. Take a firm that is based in the United States yet does business in both the upstream and downstream European markets. Gathering simple data on the exchange rates between the Dollar and Euro, as well as their recent co-movements, allows managers to implement hedging strategies for accounting and reporting purposes as well as potentially changing previous decisions that are changeable. However, understanding the historical relationship between these two currencies also enables management to better anticipate issues that may arise in this context as this historical perspective may lead to pattern recognition that aids decision-making.====Likewise, and more relevant for the current work, gathering information on global public health issues occurring in real-time may allow management to revise strategies to diversify away public health and disease risk. However, historical knowledge of past global health risks is as essential for managers to be able to model probabilities related to future endeavors (Gold et al., 2019). These previous experiences allow for either exploitation activities or risk reduction activities. Partially or fully disregarding these current issues or historical events is a breach of managerial duty and evidence of managerial dysfunction.====This paper addresses the theory on environmental scanning and managerial dysfunctions with qualitative empirical evidence on firm-level preparedness in the face of a serious, exogenous shock, namely the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that began in late 2019.==== The current work will concentrate on the Commercial Passenger Airline Industry in the United States and will report on which firms, after previous pandemics but prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, were more attentive to the probabilities of such an event. As such, the purpose of this work is to add to the literatures on ==== environmental scanning and strategic decision-making by corporate managers. More specifically, this paper looks to uncover managerial attention failure prior to an exogenous crisis even when current conditions and historic precedent gave TMTs sufficient time to plan for such events in the U.S. Airline industry.",Exogenous shocks and managerial preparedness: A study of U.S. airlines’ environmental scanning before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969972030483X,27 August 2020,2020,Research Article,326.0

Through an integrative literature review, this study points out a dominant focus, in practice and research, on customer experience and service quality, as opposed to user experience, to help airports gain a competitive edge in an increasingly commoditized industry. The review highlights several issues with this understanding of experience, as users other than passengers, such as employees, working for the airport and its myriad stakeholders, as well as visitors, are largely omitted from study. Given the complexity of the system, operationally, passengers are generally reduced to smooth flows of a passive mass, which this study argues is both a missed opportunity and a vulnerability exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Major events apart from COVID-19 are used to show the negative effects this simplification of user experience has had. Based on solutions and models proposed in previous studies, a conceptual model has been developed to illustrate the postulated potential of a deeper and more holistic study of airport user experience to make airport systems generally more agile, flexible and future-proof. As such, the paper advocates to utilize the user experience as a basis for strategic planning to equip airports with the know-how to manage not just daily operations more effectively but also the aftermath of and recovery from major events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, with the user experience at the center of the strategic roadmap, airports can plan ahead to mitigate the impact of future scenarios. The importance of future research and the use of existing research are discussed.","The coronavirus pandemic has turned commercial aviation on its head and the experience at the world's airports has changed drastically. Newspaper articles and social media have been swarming with impressions of travelers, such as reports about long queues – potential disease transmission hotspots – at underprepared, and at times overcrowded, airports around the world. If figures for the reduction in flight movements and lost revenue form the quantitative basis, the experience is the qualitative measure to report on and capture this extraordinary situation. Amid all the uncertainty, grasping what is happening is key to planning ahead – early predictions have already been proven wrong. In early March 2020, for example, news reports still compared the potential COVID-19 impact on air travel to that of 9/11 (e.g. ====; ====), but with the recent exponential growth of cases all over the world, the impact is already more severe. Recovery scenarios are being widely discussed, some implying severe damage, others being more optimistic (====). As of now, there is no consensus on the immediate future of the aviation sector; Delta Airlines, e.g., appears not to expect a full recovery within the next three years, while expecting an increased demand in premium service (====). McKinsey & Company, conversely, argue for an increased demand in low-cost offerings during the recovery, illustrating the ambiguity of the current situation (====). Whether the recovery will take five years (see ====), three, or six, we need to understand what ==== happening and what ==== happen in order to prepare our airports and airlines for the uncertain future in order to protect jobs and livelihoods; a PhocusWire headline in early April read: “There are no winners in all this, only survivors, say investors (====).”====We propose to view ==== and to use the experience of all airport users as a key factor for not just survival but mapping the way through the recovery and beyond. ====), the forecasting thereof has been noted to be rather unreliable (====; ====). The effects of the de-regulation of the industry and the evolution of low-cost carriers (====; ====) in particular, have left their mark. Competition between airports as transfer points, as well as between airlines – along with consolidation, climate change, rising oil prices – have caused further uncertainty for future developments and rendered the market more volatile (====; ====). Add to that terrorism – it took almost three years for demand to bounce back to its peak prior to 9/11 (see ====; ====) – and natural disasters like the Eyjafjallajökull eruption (see ====; ====), and VUCA seems ever present. One can learn from the experience during these past examples and the current situation in order to improve airport user experience in general, manage the recovery from, and prepare for major events beyond COVID-19.====To advocate for a paradigm shift utilizing the full potential of user experience and a holistic understanding thereof as a tool for strategic planning, this study is based on an integrative literature review with three goals: ",Airport user experience unpacked: Conceptualizing its potential in the face of COVID-19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305020,27 August 2020,2020,Research Article,327.0

All continents have seen the rise of new champions – such as Southwest, Ryanair, GOL, flydubai, AirAsia, and Jetstar – that have gained considerable market share (CAPA Center for Aviation, 2019) and applied considerable (financial) pinpricks to incumbent carriers. In their attempts to profitably serve the short-to medium-haul markets, LCCs and network carriers (and the now marginalized charter carriers) have been experimenting with all elements of their value proposition to create, inter alia, ultra-low-cost, strict premium, or hybrid business models, which sometimes even operate within the same airline group as structurally separated brands (Corbo, 2016; Fageda et al., 2015).====While once-disrupting new entrants have become incumbents themselves (Corbo, 2016) and business models in short-to medium-haul air travel have converged (Daft and Albers, 2015), another business model innovation, the long-haul low-cost (LHLC) business model, is gaining traction and threatening the industry. For about a decade, the viability of a LHLC business model has been discredited. Key differences in the nature of long-haul operations have suggested that the cost savings continental LCCs could achieve vis-á-vis their network carrier rivals would not materialize (De Poret et al., 2015; Francis et al., 2007). Several failed attempts (such as pioneer Laker Airways) and potential failures (including, most recently, rumors about the survival of Norwegian Air Shuttle) have underscored the seemingly fragile economic viability of LHLC operations (Morrell, 2008).====However, progress in aircraft technology, mounting experience with and a growing repertoire of ancillary revenue sources and cargo operations, combined with ongoing liberalization (De Poret et al., 2015) are starting to suggest a broader LHLC viability. Seemingly successful airlines that adopt the LHLC model, such as AirAsia X, Scoot or Jetstar; gains in market share on transatlantic routes at the expense of the market's incumbents (Soyk et al., 2017); and theoretical advances in the conceptualization and understanding of LHLC operations and strategy (Daft and Albers, 2012; De Poret et al., 2015; Soyk et al., 2017; Whyte and Lohmann, 2015a) contribute to this understanding.====Given this renewed momentum around LHLC in the airline industry, there is a disturbing lack of studies on LHLC and the implications for incumbent airlines, but also the entire aviation ecosystem. In light of the existing number of studies on LHLC characteristics and economic viability, our understanding of the nature and potential implications of LHLC on the airline industry remains embryonic. From a theoretical point of view, “the LHLC strategy” is still a black box, as it lacks differentiation. From an empirical perspective, LHLC ventures across the globe have been recognized and described (Jiang, 2013; Soyk et al., 2017; Whyte and Lohmann, 2015a), but are still awaiting comprehensive strategic analysis and contextualization. Accordingly, founded analyses of potential repercussions of LHLC emergence on the broader industry, and particularly on network carriers with their currently pivotal strongholds in long-haul markets, are yet to be developed.====The present paper is the first to analyze the development of the LHLC business model and its strategic implications, which it does from a disruptive innovation perspective (Christensen, 1997). After a review of extant academic work on LHLC, it provides an overview of practical attempts to launch and operate LHLC operations worldwide. It then conceptualizes the LHLC business model as a disruptive innovation and assesses its disruptive potential in the long-haul air travel market. This makes it possible to discuss strategic response options by incumbents, as well as their potential adoption by network carriers.",The long-haul low-cost airline business model: A disruptive innovation perspective,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720304622,26 August 2020,2020,Research Article,328.0

Social platforms have become a huge data source. Deep analysis of text data on social platforms and mining meaningful information for enterprises has become a research hotspot in the era of big data.====According to the 42nd Statistical Report on the Development of Internet in China issued by the China Internet Information Center on August 20, as of June 2018, the number of Internet users in China reached 802 million, with an Internet penetration rate of 57.7% (CNNIC, 2018). Even though traditional news and information software is still mainstream, it is undeniable that the rise of social media provides users with a new choice. Social media becomes an important way to spread hot news. According to the Research Report on user behavior of Chinese social application published by China Internet Information Center, social application has become an important channel for netizens to obtain news information and disseminate hot events (CNNIC, 2018). Pak and Paroubek (2010) argue that micro blogs have become a rich data source for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Social applications, as platforms and intermediaries, contain abundant text data. User-generated content constitute a corpus for text analysis.====In recent years, China's aviation industry has developed rapidly, but there are still unavoidable problems behind it. According to the National Civil Aviation Flight Operational Efficiency Rathan et al., 2018 issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the normal rate of civil aviation flights in 2017 is 71.67%, while the total number of flights reaches 5.320 million (CAAC, 2018a). In recent years, with the continuous increase in transport volume, the on-time rate of flights has always fluctuated around 75% in Fig. 1. Through research, Xu and Li (2016) report that flight delays are the main cause of most passengers' dissatisfaction.====Because of the openness of social platforms, social application platforms have become fertile ground for users to comment. Whether they are anecdotes, life stories, news reports, or experience of products and services, users can share them on social media platforms. When products or services do not meet customer expectations, customers are willing to express personal opinions on social platforms (Geho et al., 2010). And on the micro-blog platform, airlines and passengers have a high enthusiasm for interaction. Measured by the response rate, the aviation industry ranks second among all industries. Therefore, the importance of customer opinions for airlines is evident. Aviation service also has product attributes. Flight delay is obviously not expected by the customers. The gap between expectation and reality inevitably breeds discontent among passengers. Therefore, passengers tend to publish their personal feelings on the internet platform. Analyzing the factors affecting such discontent will help to improve the quality of service of enterprises.====With the rapid development of the aviation industry, the scale of air passengers is huge and thus the scale of people who experienced flight delays. Therefore, this paper analyzes the public opinion of flight delays. The user comments on SKYTRAX are collected for study.====Simple sentiment classification can only get the customers' sentiment inclination, which has limited practical value for industry. The objective of this paper is to apply text mining technology to automatically and efficiently access the information on flight delay text comments, applying a lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools to make sentiment analysis, and uses co-occurrence analysis to identify passengers' concerns on different aspects of service after flight delay in the aviation industry.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review.

Currently, Spanish airports belonging to AENA transported 263, 753, 406 passengers in 2018 (ÁR, 2018) with an increase compared to 2017 of 5.8%. In 2017, traffic was 249, 218, 316 people transported, and the increase related with 2016 was 8.2%, while 2016 pointed to 230, 231, 359 people and an increase of 11.0% over 2015 (AENA, 2019). This data enables to conclude that Spanish air transportation is growing annually and, therefore, the need to improve and assess airports' efficiency and performance is essential to maintain high levels of quality to address the demand. If we do not improve efficiency and performance, there will be a point where airports will be congested, so two options can be performed: expand airport facilities or improve their efficiency and performance. The last option is much more economical and maximises the airport infrastructure utilisation. Thus, this will increase stakeholders’ satisfaction and will reduce airport costs. In Spain, the management of airports is centralised; that is, they operate as independent profit centres but are under the control of a central authority, AENA. This study focusses on large airports leaving small (less than 1 million passengers per year) behind as they are not considered profitable.====The motivation of this work is to use an MCDA tool that will suggest how to improve performance and efficiency of Spanish airports, and thus a holistic study using a mathematical tool such as MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) is used to do so. For this purpose, this was the Multi-Criteria Decision Analyses (MCDA) methodology chosen using the PESA–AGB (Performance Efficiency Support Analysis – Airport Global Benchmarking) model. Four airports were chosen: Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas (MAD), Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat (BCN), Sevilla (SVQ) and Valencia (VLC).====Through this study, we seek to achieve improvements in many key areas of the airport, such as core, safety and security, quality service, productivity and effectiveness, financial and environment, where specific measures can be taken to reduce costs and thus improving satisfaction.

The second strike was by China Airlines pilots in February 2019, which lasted for 7 days, in which 163 flights were cancelled and 30,000 travelers affected. The airline lost 825 m NTD in revenue and compensated travelers for losses and related expenses, totaling 154 m NTD and further compensation claims from travel agencies of 1bn NTD compensation, the total market value of China Airline has dropped by more than 3.4bn NTD (====). These two large-scale strikes China Airlines staff not only incurred significant loss of revenue but also exacts hidden losses such as image and goodwill - far harder to assess. In June 2019, a third strike the longest and largest strike in Taiwan's aviation history occurred, initiated by the Taoyuan Flight Attendants' Union (TFAU). This strike lasted from June 20 to July 9, 2019, leading to the cancellation of 735 flights of EVA air with more 278,420 travelers affected and with cumulative revenue losses of 3.24 billion NTD and compensation for passenger losses and related expenditures of 805 million NTD (====). The average airline strike by a union not only brings about a decline in the brand's shareholder equity (====). Evidence from strikes experienced by Lufthansa, indicates that not only do daily costs rocket but that passenger numbers subsequently decline (====; ====).====As part of managing a crisis, in such a way as to avoid returning to the pre-crisis state and to create a less strike-prone environment (====), the significance of branding (====), specifically brand attitude (====), brand credibility (====) and intention to purchase needs clearer delineation.

Airport literature and practice provide valuable insights in terms of influencing factors and multicriteria assessment methods, at the pace that reported siting processes follow non uniform decision-making structures. Current developments in geoinformation unveil a valuable opportunity of development of a structured methodology in the field of airport siting. Brazilian public sector decision-makers recognize that such methodology has the potential to improve the allocation of federal budget for new regional airports, in terms of implementation time and political friction. This research proposes a methodology termed MESA - ==== (in Portuguese, Airport Site Selection Methodology). The purpose of MESA is to be sound under technical grounds and at the same time provide a more objective decision-making process. The proposed methodology consists of 4 phases: i) literature review of airport site selection criteria; ii) criteria systematization; iii) setting up of eliminatory criteria and their thresholds; and iv) setting up of scoring criteria and of an approach for their quantification. Eliminatory criteria reduce the original screening area, while scoring criteria are used for ranking purposes. MESA combines GIS (Geographic Information System) and classic AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) with direct assessment of alternatives through specific techniques. So far, the methodology has been applied to two real cases in the Brazilian context. In addition to effectively reducing subjectivity in airport site location decision, MESA has been demonstrating to be a powerful tool for mitigating environmental and social impacts associated to airport site selection. MESA is designed in such a way that simplifies improvements and adaptations, making it widely applicable.","Green field civil airports are required both in regions already served by air transportation or in locations completely lacking such infrastructure. As discussed by Hakim and Merkert (2016), air transportation may be a response to socioeconomic development or its cause. From this, a well-established market may require additional capacity as consequence of demand growth and sometimes existing sites cannot be expanded, prompting a new site selection process. In other cases, existing airports will be unable to comply with new requirements of airlines, regulators or the surrounding community. Hong Kong (Psaraki e and Abacoumkin, 2002), Athens (Psaraki e and Abacoumkin, 2002), Oslo (Psaraki e and Abacoumkin, 2002), Sydney (ITF, 2017), Berlin (Rothengatter, 2019) and Denver (Rothengatter, 2019) are examples of cities already served by air transportation that demanded new airports.====At a regional scale, considerable economic development can occur even when the global or national economy performs poorly, as a region can be impacted for specific market developments, such as tourism or agriculture, for instance. Taking advanvantge of accessibility as an inducer of development, remote locations may also rely on airport investment as a strategy to foster the economy. Beyond economics, according to Bråthen and Halpern (2012) (Bråthen and Halpern, 2012), air transport can be important for remote regions due to different needs, as medical care, visiting of friends and relatives or natural resources exploitation, sometimes with the need of subsidies.====Once the decision for a new airport is taken, it is necessary to find a suitable place close enough to the demand to be served. Commercial airports require extensive parcels of land, due to the required runway length, safety areas, supporting infrastructures and future development reserves. Putting into figures, surface areas of top 10 world's biggest airports range from 23.3 km==== (Beijing, China) to 780 km==== (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) (Pijet-Migoń et al., 2018). Even airports built over artificial islands occupy vast areas, as Chūbu Centrair International Airport (7 km====) and Kobe Airport (2.7 km====), both in Japan (Pijet-Migoń et al., 2018). More restricted airports as London City Airport in the UK, according to its Consultation Master Plan (London City Airport, 2020), has a stated noise contour of 9.1 km====, despite a property area of roughly 0.6 km====. Finding a suitable area close to the CBD (city Business District) may be especially hard, depending on local geography and anthropic occupation patterns, prompting to an urge to widen the screening area to the rural vicinities, if available. However, not only airport access time increases with distance, but the related investment, operational costs and social and environmental impacts of the whole project may increase. As examined by Murakami et al. (2016)(considering the 100 busiest world airports (distributed throughout 82 cities), distance to CBD ranged from 2.7 km to 41.7 km (mean = 19.48 km, Std.Dev. = 9.90 km). Such study brings a benchmark for the screening area limits, meaning that the site options may require compromises between impacts/costs of the airport itself and the supporting access system.====Airport site selection requires numerous criteria to be considered, requiring multidisciplinary teams to undertake intricate and partially subjective decision-making processes while considering trade-offs. On one hand, the airport site must comply with hard constraints, as operational safety, for instance. On the other hand, there is a societal dimension, as different stakeholders are involved. Partidário and Coutinho (2011) present a process longer than 40 years regarding the decision for the siting of a new airport for Lisbon, which ended in 2007. Surprisingly, the final site (CTA – Campo de Tiro de Alcochete) was first officially considered in 2007, after a new screening of the area. Some stakeholders were not satisfied with the formerly chosen site, due to concerns on operational safety and potential capacity, supporting the new studies (Partidário and Coutinho, 2011). Such case is representative of the methodological weaknesses of a long decision process that was missing a site that was promptly accepted. An interesting aspect of the new studies mentioned in (Partidário and Coutinho, 2011) is the role of Geoinformation.====Geoinformation allows for a synoptic view of the problem at the planning stage. It has been used in selection processes of facilities such as wind farms (van Haaren and Fthenakis, 2011) (Janke, 2010) (Ayodele et al., 2018) (Kim et al., 2018), solar farms (Janke, 2010) (Sánchez-Lozano et al., 2014), nuclear power plants (Baskurt and Aydin, 2018), landfills (Richter et al., 2019) (Şener et al., 2010) (Vasiljević et al., 2012) and hazardous waste disposal sites (Perković et al., 2020). Naturally, the challenges vary according to the specific facilities, project goals and characteristics of the regions under investigation. However, a common point is the economic and societal benefits of a more comprehensive search for potential sites and the anticipation to the planning stage of likely problems. Such use of Geoinformation is becoming more accessible owing to increased availability and diversification of spatial databases, remote sensing products, public datasets and open source software, as discussed in the review of Masson et al. (2020) (Masson et al., 2020). Although a facility location problem can benefit from geoinformation, additional methods are required to guide the decision process, in such a way that the facility constraints and goals are met. Our research based on scientific and technical literature indicates a lack of systematization of criteria to be addressed on airport site selection in the light of ongoing geoinformation advances, revealing research opportunities.====Having such literature gap in mind, along with Brazilian plans to foster regional aviation, our research team started in 2018 the development of a methodology focused on regional airports, which so far has been applied to two airport site selection cases and two others are under way. According to the Brazilian Aviation Master Plan 2018-2038 (Brasil, 2018), in the 20 years ahead R$ 9.19 billion will be required for bettering the country's regional airports, part of it for improvements and part for green field projects. Brazil is a continental country with a disperse occupation pattern and poor road and rail infrastructure. As a result, air transportation is crucial for the country's economy, defence and accessibility.====The proposed methodology hereafter referred to as MESA (====, in Portuguese, which means Airport Site Selection Methodology) has two pillars: subjectivity reduction and efficiency. The value of objectivity comes from the fact that the several stakeholders have different visions for the project and a consensus is usually hard to achieve. MESA assumes that working in the structure of the decision process, instead of working directly in the alternatives, can be a step toward objectivity. Efficiency is here intended as the aim of designing a decision process that can eliminate unsuitable areas, identify the suitable ones and value them in a way that reflects their favourability for the project. MESA has all of its empirical grounds on Brazilian Regional airports context, but we consider it is worth to share as it is flexible and can be adapted. Additionally, results from the two real world cases bring insights on how an objective decision-making process for airport site selection based on geoinformation can be deployed and improved. The envisioned model assumes the decision to build the airport to serve a city or group of cities has already been taken and therefore the screening zone has been restricted to an area tens or hundreds of kilometres in extent.====The paper structure is as follows: Section 1 presents motivation and the context of regional airport site selection in the Brazilian case. Section 2 addresses the literature on facility site selection, bringing insights on airport site selection from sectors such as energy production and waste disposal. Under Section 3, the proposed site selection decision framework is disclosed.

As a result, service performance measurement of significant systems and their consequent impact on airport users are crucial in creating better airport service design, operation and management for sustainable competitive advantage. The present study 1) assesses the applicability of the Airport Indicators of Passenger Experience (AIPEX) model on Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG), and 2) tests a theoretical model that explores the direct and indirect relationships among airport service quality, passenger affective image and satisfaction, as well as the moderating mechanism of passenger type (travel purpose) in these associations. The results indicate that, the AIPEX model fits the PVG context for airport service performance assessment. Also, the theoretical model suggests robust direct associations among processing/non-processing domains and passenger satisfaction, as well as the processing domain and passenger affective image, except non-processing domain and passenger affective image relation. Moreover, significant mediating and moderating effects of passenger affective image and travel purpose on the significant positive direct associations are found. Further, implications for theory and practice are discussed.","Civil aviation has seen a massification in China on the back of impressive economic performance (OECD, 2017) and air deregulation (Wang et al., 2016). Passenger traffic has risen, greatly, from 67.220 million in the year 2000 to 487.960 million in 2016, with a total of 595,301 people employed in air transport industry in 2016 nationwide (China Statistical Yearbook, 2017). International passengers, at the same period, increased from 6.9 million to 51.620 million contributing 290.60 (value in 100 million USD) in Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEE) in 2016. Correspondingly, the number of civil aviation routes increased from 1032 in the year 2000 to 3055 in 2016 (Domestic routes), and from 133 to 739 (International routes) same period. Nonetheless, a number of service concerns such as shortage of airport landside transport capability with evidence from Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG) have been raised (Fu et al., 2017).====Airport management in these developments is critical, because airport facilities, processes and ambience form an integral component of air travel. They are the first and last contact points of air travelers. This is especially true for foreign visitors regardless of purpose (Airports Council International (ACI), 2017). Services are not physically perceptible. However, service quality conceived of as antecedent to salient attitudinal constructs such as satisfaction and image is amply evident in airport passenger behavior and marketing literature (Bezerra and Gomes, 2020; Nghiêm-Phú and Suter, 2018; Tsafarakis et al., 2017).====The augmented air travel demand, and the dynamically competitive aviation industry require a fine understanding of the roles of airports' systems in their competitiveness. In Granberg and Munoz's (2013) perspective, the measurement of key airport systems including airport terminal services and their effects on profit maximization and sustainable airport development is essential. The growing influence of passengers sanctions evaluation of terminal service performance from passengers’ point of view. Nonetheless, existing models have been deemed as context-inappropriate and/or as lacking comprehensiveness. Reasons for the absence of a parsimonious model for airport service quality assessment range from the characterization of service as abstract (Parasuraman et al., 1988) to airport services being flagged as complex and multidimensional with multi-customer orientation (Bezerra and Gomes, 2016; Pantouvakis and Renzi, 2016). Cognizant of these limitations, Wiredja (2017) developed a holistic model – Airport Indicators of Passenger Experience (AIPEX), to fill this gap. But for the model to be useful to airport managers and regulators, its nomological networks and predictive capacity need to be established across different airport contexts. This study constitutes the first attempt in this direction.====Accordingly, the current study's contributions to theory and practice are twofold: we set out to 1) assess the applicability of the AIPEX model on Shanghai Pudong International Airport, and 2) develop a theoretical model, based on the cognitive and emotional components of satisfaction (Westbrook and Oliver, 1991), that explores a) the direct association between airport service performance and passenger satisfaction, b) the mediating effect of passenger affective image on airport service performance and passenger satisfaction link, and c) the moderating role of passenger type (i.e., purpose of travel) on the airport service performance–affective image–satisfaction link. The rest of the paper is organized into five sections: section 2 reviews literature on service quality assessment models; section 3 presents study 1 design, results and discussion – the applicability of the AIPEX model on PVG; section 4 covers model development (hypotheses' formulation); section 5 comprises of study 2 design, results and discussions – airport service performance and passenger satisfaction: the mediating and moderating effects of passenger affective image and travel purpose; and section 6 contains the overall results' summary, theoretical and practical implications, and directions for future studies.","Does the nature of airport terminal service activities matter?

In turn, this paper argues that the novel phenomenon of Ultra Long Haul (ULH) operations already maintains the necessary characteristics to generate a competitive advantage that will not only succeed, but outperform other business models, in a post COVID-19 era. Our modelling and scenario analysis results suggest that point-to-point ULH services, with access to a strong domestic feeder system, will not only require minimal adjustments to cope with COVID-19, but will simultaneously produce higher seat-load factors and yields, heightened network flexibility, and unique health benefits tied to its ability to bypass densely populated hub airports.","; ====), in a bid to gain market share. Invariably, the price wars that would ensue forced substantial downward pressure on yields, resulting in a myriad of airlines enacting significant cost-cutting measures, or even going as far as asking for financial support from their governments. The industry was already walking a tight rope, with weakening balance sheets and bankruptcies becoming increasing commonplace among airlines, but as hindsight would have it, the worst was yet to come. With this in mind, the outbreak of COVID-19, and its subsequent impact on global air-travel, pertains some of the most existentially threatening consequences to have ever hit the industry (====). Industry contraction and consolidation will take place, airline fleets will be rethought, and business models will need to be redesigned; accounting for an industry that will experience reduced and volatile levels of demand, be more reliant on inelastic travellers, and prioritises human health factors to never-before seen levels (====). With this in mind, this study will take the position that Ultra Long-Haul (ULH) operations, a relatively novel phenomenon, already maintains the characteristics necessary to succeed in a post COVID-19 era, even in a context in which the virus is never truly eradicated.====As such, “the term Ultra Long-Haul refers to flights of 14.5 h or more... with a minimum greater-circle distance of 12,842 km” (====, p. 6). These segments typically “seek to directly connect cities in far reaching corners of the earth, leveraging the enhanced capabilities of new-age aircraft, thereby saving time-sensitive passengers hours of total travel-time when compared to a traditional one-stop, Hub & Spoke itinerary” (====, p. 8). Despite often commanding a price premium, Ultra Long-Haul became an especially preferable option among corporate travellers, which in turn worked to shape the available network of ULH routes around the world. As such, distant financial and business hubs were sought to be connected directly, symbolised by Singapore Airways' launching its record-breaking, but commercially unsuccessful, SQ21/22 Singapore-New York (Newark) service in 2004. Since then, several ULH routes have emerged, as well as re-emerged including Singapore's SQ21/22 service in 2018 after having been cut in 2013, but none more commercially successful than that of Qantas' landmark QF9/10 Perth-London service (Flight ====). Since its inception in 2018, this 14,500 km flight, the first to ever directly connect Australia with Europe, has exceeded all expectations by claiming Load Factors in excess of 90% and generating higher Net Promoter scores (measure of the willingness of customers to recommend a company's products or services to others) than any other international route served by the Australian flagship carrier.====To this end, ULH services have proven to be greater than just a more efficient option for the time-sensitive traveller. From the customer standpoint, the on-board experience has been heightened holistically throughout both the hard and soft product, with the prioritisation of human factors having become “central to an airline's approach when developing ULH projects” (====, p. 35). From the airline's perspective, ULH segments largely simplify operations, removing the need to stop-over in foreign countries, eliminating the financial and environmental burden of an additional take-off and landing, whilst providing a scope to generate product differentiation from competitors; including the ability to afford less physical exposure to others and resultantly, a reduced risk of passengers contracting COVID-19. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section ==== discusses the advantages of the ULH business model in such an environment, followed by a discussion of the potential limitations and pitfalls of ULH services in section ====. In Section ====, we aim to provide forward looking analysis to assess the potential success of ULH projects in a range of post-COVID-19 scenarios, and Section ==== offers some conclusions and suggestions for further research.",Ultra Long-Haul: An emerging business model accelerated by COVID-19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720304853,20 August 2020,2020,Research Article,334.0

Accordingly, in this paper, we addressed if the transmission of COVID-19 an ‘accident’ within the Conventions' meaning and the period of air carrier's liability for passengers' contraction of COVID-19, taking into consideration the exoneration of air carrier's liability in COVID-19 cases.

In this paper, both conventions collectively will be referred to as (the Conventions). The Conventions used slightly different wording of article 17 which established the elements of the air carrier's liability. Article 17 (1) of the Montreal Convention stipulates that ‘The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of death or bodily injury of a passenger upon condition only that the accident which caused the death or injury took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking’.====The passenger has to prove the elements of: damage sustained, a recognized loss (death or bodily injury), the existence of an accident, causation, the place where the accident occurred is on board the aircraft or during the operations of embarking or disembarking. The passenger, regardless of the nature of the air carrier, has to prove the elements of the carrier's liability. This paper will focus on the related elements of air carrier's liability for passengers' safety during the COVID-19 pandemic and it will analyse whether the change in the nature of the liability has an impact on these elements. Due to the possible connection between COVID-19 cases and some of the elements of air carrier's liability, the elements of accident and the location of the accident will be analysed in this paper.====The main issue here for a passenger who got infected by COVID-19 during the flight is whether the infection by COVID-19 constitutes an ‘accident’ according to the Conventions. The other element which needs to be analysed in relation to COVID-19 cases is the location of this accident in order to establish air carrier's liability. On the other hand, due to the change in the nature of air carrier's liability in the MC-99 the defences available to the carrier to exonerate himself from liability in these Conventions have changed.====This paper will analyse these defences with focusing on the more related one to COVID-19 cases which is the contributory negligence of the passenger (====).

Internal and external factors influencing pilot performance reliability are important elements to estimate human error probability. However, dependencies between these factors, including state dependencies and effect dependencies, are always ignored or only partially considered in most human reliability analysis (HRA) method. This paper attempts to develop a methodology incorporating both state and effect dependencies between contributory factors into HRA for airline pilot tasks based on fuzzy logic and the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM). Anchor points were determined for each common performance condition (CPC) state levels through airline pilot elicitation process and then corresponding state and effect fuzzy sets were constructed for each CPC. The CPC dependency fuzzy inference rules were constructed and transformed with reference to the CPC dependency assessing rule in CREAM. And a cognitive failure probability (CFP) calculation method based on the final CPC effect fuzzy sets and the extended CREAM was proposed. To illustrate the use of the proposed methodology, a case study about commercial airline pilot taxiing task was given. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology and its capability of representing the ambiguity and fuzziness of expert judgement.","With the progress of technology, the reliability of hardware is gradually improved, and human error has become the biggest threat to the safety of civil air transportation (CAA, 2013; Netjasov and Milan, 2008; Stanton et al., 2016). To predict and reduce human error, many human reliability analysis methods have been developed. The occurrence of human error is affected by human, technical, environmental and organizational factors, which are referred as performance shaping factors (PSFs) in human reliability analysis (HRA) (Embrey, 1984; Swain and Guttman, 1983). Other names of these factors include common performance conditions (CPCs) (Hollnagel, 1998), error producing condition (EPC) (Williams, 1986). Almost all HRA methods take into account the effect of PSFs on human error/human reliability, and use them to describe task context and calculate human error probability (HEP). However, one shortcoming of most human reliability analysis methods is the lack of adequate consideration of the dependencies between PSFs.====The dependency between PSFs is ubiquitous in the complex civil air transportation system which has a significant impact on pilot performance and the success or failure of tasks related to flight procedures (Bandeira et al., 2018). PSF dependency assessment is an important and challenging task in HRA (Ambroggi and Trucco, 2011; Chang and Mosleh, 2006). However, unlike the widely recognized and studied human failure event (HFE) dependencies (Čepin, 2008; Li et al., 2016; Podofillini et al., 2010; Zheng and Deng, 2018; Zio et al., 2009), PSF dependencies are always ignored (Groth and Mosleh, 2010). Many HRA methods assume that PSFs are independent each other, such as the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) (Swain and Guttman, 1983), the Success Likelihood Index Method (SLIM) (Embrey, 1984) and the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) (Williams, 1986). And some other methods do not explicitly consider the dependency between PSFs, such as the Human Event Repository and Analysis (HERA) (Hallbert et al., 2006). Whereas, some later developed HRA methods, such as the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) (Hollnagel, 1998), the Standardized Plant Analysis Risk Human Reliability Analysis (SPAR-H) (Blackman and Boring, 2017; Gertman et al., 2005), the Information, Decision, and Action in Crew context (IDAC) (Chang and Mosleh, 2007a, b), consider the dependency between PSFs to some extent.====In some recent studies, the dependency between PSFs has received more and more attention (Groth and Mosleh, 2009, 2012). However, there is no consensus on how to identify these interrelations (Kim et al., 2015). Ambroggi and Trucco (2011) used Analytic Network Process (ANP) to model the PSF dependencies and incorporated their influence on HEP by adjusting PSF weights. Kim et al. (2015) use the logistic regression and stepwise variable selection to estimate the effects of the PSF on HEPs related with the soft controls. Researchers also recommended that to develop a quantitative model including both the causality between PSFs and HEPs and the causality between PSFs, structural equation modeling techniques may be alternatives to estimation approaches (Bollen, 1998; Liu and Li, 2014). Since PSF causality is the basic input for Bayesian Networks based HRA methods, some others scholars suggest employing Bayesian Networks to assess the PSF dependency (Adedigba et al., 2016; Li, 2011; Mkrtchyan et al., 2014, 2015; Musharraf et al., 2016).====The dependency between PSFs can be further classified into two types, i.e., PSF state dependency (Fig. 1A) and PSF effect dependency (Fig. 1B) (Ambroggi and Trucco, 2011). Most of the rare existing studies only considered the PSF state dependency, but ignore the PSF effect dependency (Ambroggi and Trucco, 2011). Bayesian networks are considered to be a powerful tool for representing PSF dependencies, but it is difficult to represent the PSF effect dependencies. Hollnagel (1998) creatively distinguished the PSF effect from the PSF state (called CPC in CREAM), providing an inspiration to evaluate the PSF effect dependency.====Guidance is provided in CREAM to consider the dependency between CPC effects, however, the CPC state dependencies are ignored instead. Moreover, the CPC dependency analysis rules proposed in CREAM are deterministic methods, which cannot reflect the general uncertainty and fuzziness in HRA. Fuzzy logic system (FLS) is an effective tool to express uncertainty and ambiguity and has been widely used in HRA recently (Baziuk et al., 2016; Konstandinidou et al., 2006; Li et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2018). Moreover, fuzzy logic has also been broadly utilized in airline operation researches (Barak and Dahooei, 2018; Chang et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2014; Hadjimichael, 2009; Ravizza et al., 2014; Skorupski, 2016). This paper tries to combine fuzzy logic system with the CREAM method, thus providing a framework to take PSF/CPC dependencies into consideration when estimating pilot performance reliability in civil air transportation. As the method framework is based on CREAM, the term CPC, instead of PSF, will be used in the remaining part of the paper.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the CPC effect assessment rules in CREAM. Section 3 introduces the basic concept of fuzzy logic system. Section 4 describes the proposed method based on the integration of FLS and CREAM and its application procedure. Section 5 provides a case study to illustrate the use of the proposed method.

Air fare reduction has narrowed operational margins of airlines, bringing financial and employment instability. This has brought airlines to pay increasing attention to flying costs reduction. Two important components of flying costs airlines can try to cut modifying the planned flight are en route charges and operational costs. We rely on Demand Data Repository (DDR2) data to calculate deviations from planned flight trajectories to analyse the extent to what airlines try to cut operational costs making shorter flights than planned if possible, and cut en route charges providing a planned flight with lower en route charges than the planned flight. Our findings show that there is no generalised strategy among airlines to reduce en-route charges asking for deviations of the planned route. On the other hand, airlines are achieving savings of operational costs regularly. Higher savings per nautical mile are obtained in night flights, with longer planned distance and operated by low cost carriers.","The importance of air traffic analysis is becoming increasingly important, as air transport is one of the sectors that are constantly growing: according to Bourguignon and Darpeix (2016), currently, ‘traffic grows twice as fast as GDP’. This growth can be attributed to the deregulation of air transport in the most relevant air transport markets, included the European, since the 1980s. This deregulation lead to an increase of air traffic, together with a reduction of air fares (Alderighi et al., 2012). Air fare reduction has narrowed operational margins of airlines, bringing financial and employment instability (Goetz and Vowles, 2009). This has brought airlines to pay increasing attention to cost reduction (Zuidberg, 2014). Two important components of flying costs airlines can cut modifying the planned flight are en route charges and operational costs.====While operational costs can be approximated by the total distance flown, the calculation of en route charges is more complex. In the European airspace, en route charges are collected by EUROCONTROL on behalf of its member states through the Central Route Charges Office (CRCO). The invoicing process for these charges is described in CRCO (2019). Charges for each en route charging zone (ECZ) are proportional to a distance factor, proportional to the distance between entry and exit points of each ECZ. The distance factor is calculated with information stated in the planned flight plan reported by the airline before the flight takes place.====Airlines may have incentives to behave opportunistically: once the flight is started, pilots would request route modification that would diminish operational costs by crossing areas with higher en route charges. These route modifications are the result of an ==== interaction between pilots and air traffic controllers, depending on the circumstances of real air traffic. Operational costs can be considered a function of the total distance covered, so a deviation from the planned flight resulting in a shorter route results in a reduction of operational costs. Acting this way, airlines could not only lower their operational cost, but also en route charges, reporting a planned route that passes through areas with cheaper en route charges. In spite of the rich available information on air trajectory deviations, to our knowledge no studies exist examining the impact of these trajectory deviations on flight costs. We intend to fill this gap in the literature examining if airlines have a systematic strategy of reduction of flying costs through trajectory deviations. To achieve that aim, we analyse the impact of ex post route modifications on operational costs, possibly with routes that if planned would have led to higher en route charges.",Cost savings from trajectory deviations in the European air space,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720304713,15 August 2020,2020,Research Article,338.0

A bootstrapped binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between wave-system structure and its influential factors. Further, a partial least squared regression model was employed to uncover the determinants of wave-system structures' configuration. It is found that the interaction effects of two types of flight rates positively determine the existence of a wave-system structure, and the rate of airline's daily flights had the biggest impact on the configurations of wave-system structures.","A wave-system structure at a large hub airport consists of connecting waves, which means ‘a complex of incoming and outgoing flights, structured such that all incoming flights connect to all outgoing flights […]’(Bootsma, 1997). This concept has been considered as an effective method to improve flight connection and enlarge the market size of airlines with a small scale of fleet by the decision makers of a series of large airlines. For example, American Airlines (AA) and Deutsche Lufthansa (LH) have organized different types of wave-system structures at their main hub airports (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, DFW and Flughafen München, MUC), respectively. Meanwhile, some other large network airlines do not employ or are gradually abandoning the organizing of wave-system structures at their hub airports. For example, most flight schedules of Southwest Airlines (WN) and Delta Air Lines (DL) at their main hub airports (e.g., Dallas Love Field airport, DAL; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, ATL) do not follow the shape of wave-system structures. However, at present organizing wave-system structures at hub airports is still considered by many countries as one of the effective methods to improve the airlines' operation. Recently, the fast development of China civil aviation industry has brought fierce competition to both airlines and airports in China.

The scheme has multiple objectives. First, it wants to increase footprints of ==== to unserved and underserved airports of India. Second, it intends to make flying more affordable. It comes out, the aviation market in the country has expanded due to the addition of new routes under the scheme but data indicates that there is a regional imbalance in the performance of the scheme. Moreover, there are still questions on the long term sustainability of many routes and finding a solution for neglect of some priority regions. We have identified economic and commercial challenges that need to be addressed for the program to achieve its goals. The insights gathered during the study can be generalized and policy makers and managers of remote area air-connectivity schemes of different countries should find them useful.","Deregulation of airline industries across the world has ushered free-market competition. Greater efficiency, better quality of service and success found by entrepreneurial ventures have spurred growth of commercial aviation (Goetz and Vowles, 2009). Passenger traffic volume has grown with the addition of new routes, lower fares, higher frequency and more choices. In this regard, several studies have established the positive influence of air connectivity to a region on its economic growth (e.g; Mukkala, 2013; Baker et al., 2015; Airports Council International Europe, 2015; Brathen et al., 2018).====However, most of the past research on airline competition and efficiency have focused on dense routes. Not much work has been done on post-liberalization developments in low traffic regional routes (Fageda and Flores-Fillol, 2012). When airlines compete with each other for a profit, there could be a natural exclusion of regional services on low traffic and low revenue-potential routes.====Indeed, there are regions in every country that airlines ignore due to commercial unviability of operation. Air connectivity to such areas may be supported through direct government subsidies or cross-subsidization under policy regulations (IATA, 2017). State support for regional and remote air connectivity is provided in many countries. Some of the schemes, viz. Essential Air Services (EAS) in the USA, Public Service Obligations (PSO) in Europe, Remote Air Subsidy Scheme (RASS) in Australia are in operation for decades. Similar schemes are also present in Canada (Metrass-Mendes et al., 2011), Russia (Russian Government, 2018), China (Zhang, 2013; Ge, 2017) and Brazil (Baldwin, 2014).====There can be multiple objectives for state interventions in inclusive air transportation. Routes identified as ‘regional’, ‘remote’, ‘commercially unviable’ or ‘isolated areas’ are selected to ensure equity in access to a prominent public infrastructure. Countries, which have already got a well-developed air transport network, promote connectivity to far-flung areas through ‘lifeline’ services across difficult terrains for ensuring a minimum frequency of domestic connectivity. State schemes in the USA, Canada, Australia as well as in Europe fall under this category.====Another objective for state funding is to promote territorial cohesion, social and political integration by connecting remote and isolated regions of a country (Reynolds-Feighan, 1999). Countries that are geographically spread out may need to address the alienation of some of its communities e.g. subsidized air connectivity to Kaliningrad-an exclave of Russia, island connectivity in Spain, southwest province connectivity in China and north-east connectivity in India. Countries also develop national transportation networks to connect small airports to a hub or develop regional hubs to disperse the load on a few metropolitan centers. Airlines are incentivized to establish hubs in a non-major airport and for increasing departures from and to that airport (Núñez-Sánchez, 2015).====Fageda et al. (2018) have critically reviewed the schemes and policies of different countries supporting air connectivity in remote areas. They have classified various policies into the following four categories: Route-based policies, Passenger-based policies, Airline-based policies and Airport-based policies. A mix of more than one category is also adopted by some. The route-based policies are most commonly used and are prevalent in USA, Europe and Australia. Passenger based policies aim to provide direct benefit (discounted tickets etc.) to certain categories of passengers. Airline specific policies are seen in countries having state carriers. Airport-based policies incentivize carriers for operating to specific airports.====These policies have contributed to different kinds of impacts of the air connectivity in remote regions. Such impacts include the reduction of barriers to movement of passengers and goods and stimulating long-term growth in the area, the generation of new profitable routes for airlines, increase of employment, and providing to the population with better access to public services. However, many of these policies have received criticisms. Positions against these policies question in some cases the real need of government intervention given that in some cases they are applied in routes/regions where air services could be viable on a commercial basis. Furthermore, it is typical for the determination of service levels, fares, and subsidies to be arbitrary. A further criticism relates to the lack of proper incentives to provide air services efficiently and the possible distortion of competition. Even if there is room for improvement in their specific implementation, it is not generally questioned that these policies may contribute to the well-being of citizens living in remote regions.====While past research has focused on developed countries, commercial aviation in developing economies is expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, India is a country with the second largest population in the world and has immense diversity. At present, the Indian aviation market is ninth-largest in the world, valued at USD 16 billion and poised to become the third-largest aviation market after the USA, China and overtaking the UK by 2025 (International Trade Administration, 2018). In spite of this exponential growth, the per-capita air travel penetrations in the country is just 0.08 air trips per annum. This is not only minuscule compared to developed nations but also very small in comparison to developing nations like China and Brazil. Further, most of the traffic is concentrated on trunk domestic routes.====Hence, there is a latent scope for expansion of commercial aviation in India although some regions cannot be part of the expansion without external support. The government has been experimenting with policy measures and schemes to add underserved and unserved airports to the national network, mostly achieving minimal success. To this point, subsidized connectivity to its northeastern region has existed on a small scale for more than a decade.====The new Indian Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) was started in 2016. The Indian RCS is an ambitious program that employs a combination of route-based and airline-based policies. It has a budget higher than the entire PSO program in Europe or the EAS program in the United States and has effects on a vast number of routes in the domestic market.====Some operators have seen commercial opportunity (demonstrated in their bidding strategies) but a few participate as an obligation under the prevalent regulations. Although the Government has promised support to ensure commercial feasibility, there are questions on the sustainability of the program due to rising costs as well as operational reasons. Furthermore, the focus of the program is, support air services in unserved and underserved airports so that it does not necessarily meet the special needs of remote regions, particularly in the north-east part of the country.====In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the Indian RCS. We analyze data related to relevant characteristics of airports, routes and regions benefited by the program to interpret the early indicators and infer about the future of the program. In addition, we have identified economic and commercial challenges that need to be addressed for the program to achieve its goals.====Previous studies on regional air connectivity policies focus on specific programs in remote regions of developed countries. Furthermore, most of these previous studies examine route-based policies. Not intended to be exhaustive, examples of such studies include Grubesic and Matisziw (2011) and Özcan (2014) for the US, Calzada and Fageda (2012) and Fageda et al. (2012) for Spain, Angelopoulos et al. (2013) for Greece, Lian and Rønnevik (2011) for Norway, or Di Francesco and Pagliari (2012) for Italy.====Here, we analyze a program that directly affects all regions of a huge developing country that, in turn, has regions that can be considered remote. Hence, we add to previous literature by examining a policy with unique characteristics in terms of both the scale, the diversity of tools employed and the socio-economic and geographical context in which it is applied.====The paper is organized as follows. The second section discusses the policies implemented in India to support regional connectivity with a particular focus on the Regional Connectivity scheme. Data analysis is presented next. Critical evaluation of the findings and postulates implications for the future of the program is in the fourth section.

Airports are no longer places where planes just take off and land. Various industries cluster at and around airports to take advantage of accessibility, speed, and mobility (Reiss, 2007). Supported by air cargo flow and business flow, these industries have formed a unique economic development model that is dominated by aviation-oriented industries and organically related to some other industries that support production and lifestyles. Airport Economic Zones (AEZs), where airports are regarded as key drivers of industries location and urban economic growth, have been developed into airport-led urban areas to attract investment, boost trade, and create jobs (Freestone, 2009).====In 1992, the Southwest Airport-based Economic Development Zone was established in Chengdu, which is an embryonic form of China's AEZs. Since the implementation of airport localization reform in 2004, a wave of development and construction of AEZs has emerged in China. Several cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Xiamen, successively launched the planning and construction of airport economy development. In 2013, the Zhengzhou Airport Economic Comprehensive Experimental Zone was established as a “National New Zone with Aviation Economy as the Theme”, marking the rise of AEZ development into a national strategy, which further stimulated the enthusiasm for constructing AEZs in China. By the end of 2018, more than 100 airports and their surrounding areas had been planned or constructed into AEZs (Kasarda, 2018).====However, these AEZs are going through various developmental stages and there is a gap between them and the national strategic objectives. Problems such as similar AEZ planning schemes, weak industrial directionality of aviation, and unreasonable space utilization are prominent. In order to promote the healthy and orderly development of AEZs, 12 National Airport Economic Demonstration Zones have been approved, as shown in Fig. 1.====These National Airport Economic Demonstration Zones have been set up on vast fields in the suburbs and occupy a large area of undeveloped land, except Shanghai, the smallest one, where Hongqiao airport is near the central business district and an industrial cluster of headquarters has already formed (Jiang et al., 2018). By granting special policies to designated airports and adjacent specific areas, these zones are encouraged to explore how to develop on the basis of the agglomeration effects of air transport, high-end manufacturing, and modern service. Relevant policy trials cover various aspects of civil aviation management, land management, financial support and so on. With the strong support of the government, Langfang Area, just one district of Beijing Daxing AEZ, has attracted 336 enterprises worldwide during one year, covering 11 industrial sectors including advanced equipment manufacturing, aviation logistics, biopharmaceutical and electronic information, and has obtained an investment of 1.80 billion dollars in financing projects, 16.32 billion dollars in infrastructure projects, and 32.54 billion dollars in industrial projects.====Although the development momentum of AEZs in China is positive at this stage, the functions, scale, and profits of the existing AEZs are still insufficient. According to the Annual Report of Airport Economic Development in China (2016–2017) (Lian et al., 2017), the industries in AEZs have a low utilization rate of air transport, and the directionality of aviation is not obvious. In addition, the interrelationships of industries are weak, and collaboration along the industry chain is low; therefore, the combined effect of airport industries is not being realized. A small scale of land use, sparse population, low intensity of land use, and poor economic benefits also exist. Considering the resource endowment of the airport and the region, the construction of a competitive airport industry cluster system with obvious aviation characteristics and a strategy for obtaining the maximum economic benefits from limited land resources have become a theoretical and practical issue that has attracted much attention in the research field of AEZs.",Industry choice for an airport economic zone by multi-objective optimization,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720304567,13 August 2020,2020,Research Article,343.0

To contribute to the conceptual and prescriptive discussion over the industry's response, our paper focuses on one specific aspect of the COVID-19 response set for airlines that has hitherto been overlooked by the emerging research on this topic – namely nonmarket strategy. This is salient because of the profound public policy impact that responses to COVID-19 are exerting worldwide. Scholars, executives and policymakers can all benefit from a clearer framing of the nonmarket options they face. This paper provides such a novel, integrative strategic framing that complements technical analyses of pandemics on airline operations as well as assessments of economic impacts of the latter on countries generally and the industry specifically.====A concept first introduced by economist Albert ====, nonmarket strategy has been used by strategy and international business scholars since the late 1980s (====; ====). It came to be understood as a broad, integrative term for corporate strategic actions directed at governmental, legal-regulatory, political, and social environments of business. ====The nonmarket strategy literature suggests that there are two broad categories of nonmarket strategic initiatives that executives can choose to pursue. On one hand, there are so-called bargaining strategies, where executives explicitly or implicitly engage powerful governmental, political or societal actors to pursue public policy outcomes beneficial to firms. Bargaining strategies cover a broad array of approaches that vary in terms of the mutual attitude of firms and governmental/societal actors (the so-called “conflictual” and “partnership” bargaining nonmarket strategies; ====) as well as the time horizon over which engagement is being conducted (the so-called “transactional” and “relational” bargaining nonmarket strategies; ====). Examples of bargaining strategies include lobbying, campaign contributions, engagement and negotiations with advocacy and NGOs groups, neo-corporatist dialog through industry chambers or tripartite commissions, arbitration and litigation as well as illegal corruption.====Nonbargaining approaches stand in contrast to bargaining strategies. They are a set of initiatives focusing on interactions with the firm's nonmarket environment that does not involve direct engagement with political or social actors.

The results show that variables representing the temporal and spatial characteristics of connecting flights have significant impacts on the hub connectivity of PEK. In specific, the changeable threshold of maximum connecting time based on different international destination regions has a negative impact. This paper identifies different timetable coordination modes at PEK and shows that the number of indirect connections under adjacent mode is significantly less than that of distant mode. Circuity and directionality are proven to have significant impacts. In addition, factors representing airport characteristics and heterogeneity of international destination regions also affecting the hub connectivity of PEK.","Airport connectivity research has become an increasingly significant topic for the benchmark of airport competition and network performance (Burghouwt and Veldhuis, 2006; Zhang et al., 2017), as well as the understanding of international trade and transport policy (Ruiz-Rua et al., 2016). There exist three types of connectivity, namely, direct, indirect and hub connectivity (Burghouwt and Redondi, 2013; Derudder et al., 2007). The former two types of connectivity are considered from the accessibility perspective. In this way, an airport is positioned as an origin or destination point. The metrics are thus applied to calculate the number and quality of direct and indirect connections available to the consumer ==== the airport. Whereas the latter is considered from the centrality perspective. In this scenario, an airport is positioned as an intermediate transfer point. The indicators are adopted to measure the number of transfer opportunities available ==== the airport.====To date, not many papers examine the drivers of connectivity of airports in China. Exceptions are Zhang et al. (2017) and Huang and Wang (2017). The former proposed a new method to calculate the direct connectivity of airports in China and further identifying its drivers. But the research did not pay attention to the indirect and hub connectivity of Chinese airports due to its sole focus of the domestic market. The latter investigated the evolution of the indirect connectivity in Chinese hub airports, but still lacked an explanation of how the threshold of maximum connecting time (MaxCT) – i.e., a consisting part of wave-system structure==== adopted by full-service carriers (FSCs) and serving as one of the fundamental elements of measuring the indirect connectivity of an airport – was determined. MaxCT plays a significant role in improving the hub connectivity of an airport and is the outcome of the tradeoff between carriers' benefits and travelers' welfare. From the perspective of carriers, the larger value of MaxCT can create a greater number of indirect flights. However, it may reduce travelers’ willingness to choose a transfer flight with longer waiting time. Therefore, a sophisticated design of MaxCT can help airports create a large number of indirect flights with good quality by comprehensively considering the benefits of carriers, travelers and airports ====.====Meanwhile, the examination of indirect connectivity mainly focuses on the accessibility instead of the transfer ability of a hub airport. Therefore, in order to better understand the hubbing practice of airports in China, this paper investigates factors influencing the hub connectivity of Chinese hub airports - a research direction that, to the best of our knowledge, is mostly neglected in the current, existing literature.====Since 2012, Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has emphasized the development of Beijing Capital (PEK), Shanghai Pudong (PVG), and Guangzhou Baiyun (CAN) airports (the so-called ‘big three’) as the cornerstone international hub airports in China (CAAC, 2012). A hub airport is characterized to be capable of dealing with a large number of origin and destination (O&D) and connecting travelers (Martín and Voltes-Dorta, 2009), while offering a large percentage of good-quality indirect connections (Burghouwt and Redondi, 2013). Nevertheless, the hub practices in China can merely be examined in its international markets as the ‘real’ hubbing of domestic markets is still in a developing phase (Zhang, 2010) - although a hub-and-spoke (H&S) structure is gradually being adopted by FSCs in China (Huang and Wang, 2017). Among the big three, PEK ranked top 1 in terms of overall and domestic connectivity and top 2 in the international connectivity in 2016 according to Civil Aviation Big Data (CABD) (2016) and Zhang et al. (2017). However, it only ranked number 21 in the worldwide airport network and was far behind several hub airports in the US and Europe. As one of the national gateways in China, it is thus urgent for PEK to understand the drivers of hub connectivity in its international markets.====Although few papers have explicitly researched the factors influencing the hub connectivity of a specific hub airport, some descriptive analysis on hub connectivity and studies that investigated the drives of (in)direct airport connectivity can be relevant. The potential factors can be generally divided into three aspects: (1) the temporal characteristics of indirect flights via a hub airport; (2) the spatial characteristics of indirect flights via a hub airport; and (3) the economic and regional drivers of cities where O&D airports are located.====For factors representing the temporal characteristics of indirect flights via a hub airport, relevant research refers to the setting of (minimum and maximum) connecting time (always abbreviated as MCT and MaxCT, respectively) and hub timetable coordination. The problem of the setting of connecting time mainly remains for the MaxCT due to the difficulty to determine its threshold (Burghouwt and de Wit, 2005; Dennis, 1994; Huang and Wang, 2017). Hub timetable coordination refers to the way how carriers adopting an H&S network structure schedule arrival and departure flights at their hubs (Danesi, 2006). Ideally, a wave-system structure is applied to minimize the connecting time and maximize the number of connections, whereby the inbound flights all arrive within a relatively short and limited time period, and the corresponding outbound flights depart within a short time period once most or all of the inbound flights have arrived (Goedeking, 2010). However, in practice, the coordination mode of a specific hub airport is not always easy to identify, especially for those that only partially adopt such a wave-system structure, such as PEK in China.====Factors representing the spatial characteristics of indirect flights via a hub airport include directionality and circuity (or routing factor). Goedeking (2010) pointed out that directionality at hubs can significantly reduce the number of connections. Veldhuis (1997) and Burghouwt and Redondi (2013) summarized that the quality of an indirect connection decreases as the routing increases. Furthermore, researchers also consider the economic and regional drivers of cities where O&D airports are located (Maertens, 2010; Zhang et al., 2017). For instance, Zhang et al. (2017) found that tourism-oriented and hub-oriented cities can have impacts on the connectivity of airports in China. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how factors representing the temporal and spatial characteristics of indirect flights, as well as the economic and regional characteristics of cities where airports are located influence the hub connectivity.====To sum up, the objective of this paper is to systematically explore factors influencing the hub connectivity of PEK in its domestic to international markets. We especially pay attention to how the main factors representing the temporal and spatial characteristics of indirect flights, e.g., MaxCT and coordination mode, influence the hub connectivity of PEK by proposing comprehensive methods to determine these key factors.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources and provides exploratory analysis on explaining the concept, calculation and identification procedures of four factors (i.e., MaxCT, coordination mode, directionality and circuity) representing the temporal and spatial characteristics of indirect flights. The econometric model is introduced and explained in Section 3, followed by Section 4 where the main findings are presented and the implications of the results are also discussed. The final section summarizes our major findings and provides some suggestions for further research.",Factors influencing the hub connectivity of Beijing Capital Airport in its international markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720304579,30 July 2020,2020,Research Article,346.0

The advantages of these methodologies are also enumerated. It is observed that annual revenue is the most important evaluation criterion, followed by the total number of passengers. Based on this integrated analysis, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Surat International Airport respectively emerge out as the best and the worst performing international airports in India.","An airport can be defined as a complex organization consisting of runways and buildings for take-off, landing and maintenance of civil aircraft, facilities for passengers, fire and police services etc. (Humphreys and Francis, 2002). It acts as an interchange transportation mode while fulfilling a wide ranging needs associated with the movements of passengers and commodities worldwide. With continuous liberalization, privatization and globalization, it has become essential for the airports to provide the best quality of services to their customers and sustain in the present day highly competitive commercial environment. After deregulation and privatization of the airports, air fares dramatically dropped down and low cost carriers emerged out, enabling the middle-class people to avail the air transportation facilities resulting in rapid growth of tourism. Air transportation industry always plays a major role for enrichment of the global economy with respect to its own operations and influences on other related industries. It is now striving to increase the revenues and reduce losses through endless improvement.====Nowadays, due to privatization of several airports, it has become a mandatory task to address the issues regarding performance evaluation of the competing airports. Due to increasing strategic importance of the movement of people and cargo in the globalized world, airports are under tremendous pressure to upgrade their service quality and efficiency as compared to their competitors. Thus, in order to fulfil these objectives, airports must endeavour to appraise their performance and effectiveness periodically. In this direction, benchmarking analysis can be an effective solution to drive the worst performing airports towards the frontier of the most efficient ones while identifying their major weaknesses. Due to the existence of numerous interacting factors, like passengers, airlines, handling agents, surface transport service providers etc., it is not easy to adopt an appropriate methodology to measure an airport's performance. An effective airport performance evaluation system ultimately helps in identifying the efficient airports to provide continuous air transportation services, guiding the governments to monitor utilization of their investments, reduce operating costs, and increase market share and return on investment, and aiding the airport authorities with valuable insights about the relative strengths and weaknesses with respect to other competing airports (Barros and Dieke, 2008; Perçin, 2018). It is expected that airports should streamline their operations to continuously attract new customers and retain the existing customers by providing satisfactory services (Gupta, 2018). Providing high quality service to the passengers can finally lead to long term success and competitiveness of an airport.====Besides providing the basic functionalities, like availing planes, attending in-transit meetings or duty-free shopping, airports also lodge facilities for time-sensitive distribution, hotel, entertainment, convention, trade and exhibition complexes, and office buildings for air-travel intensive executives and professionals. A close connection between airports and regional development along with employment growth has already been statistically established. Airports and airline service contribute more to knowledge and service-based businesses than industrial production. The aviation industry is a rapidly growing sector of the economy, providing the safest and efficient mode of public transportation. Airports of the developing countries are connected to those of the developed countries, which facilitate access to the remote and inaccessible areas, significantly improve living standards, and allow speedy delivery of medical supplies and emergency aid relief. There is always a public pressure in prompting this aviation sector to contribute more to ending poverty and boosting trade opportunities in developing countries, like India. In the 21st century when the Indian economy is ready to be integrated itself with the global economy, upgradation and modernization of the airports are supposed to play important roles. As the Indian aviation sector is capital intensive, there is always an ardent requirement for perspective planning to promote the underperforming international airports with effective utilization of the available resources.====Thus, the task of performance assessment of the airports while ranking them in order of their performance scores and singling out the best performing airport can be formulated as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In order to evaluate and rank airports from a pool of participating alternatives, there exist numerous criteria which are often opposing in nature. Several studies have already been performed to address the efficiency and productivity issues of airport operations, but there are only few researches dealing with relative ranking of a set of competing airports to help the decision makers (passengers, airport managers, governments, investors etc.) in taking appropriate and timely decisions (Tovar and Martín-Cejas, 2010). It creates a scope of employing different MCDM techniques to appraise the performance of various competing airports and recognize the best one for subsequent benchmark analysis (Dožić, 2019). The objective of this paper is thus focussed on the applications of two MCDM techniques, i.e. best worst method (BWM) and multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method to rank 32 major international airports in India based on a set of eight evaluation criteria. The BWM is first applied to derive the weights of the considered criteria with reduced number of pair-wise comparisons while providing more consistent solutions. On the other hand, MABAC method is adopted to rank all the considered Indian airports from the best to the worst, and also to identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of each of them. This approach takes into account both the opinions of the expert airport personnel and numerical data in an integrated way resulting into more effective and informed decision making process. With increasing volume of air traffic, the Indian international airports have to optimize their existing infrastructures in order to provide high quality services to a variety of customers. Thus, a performance evaluation approach based on real time operational data would be more informative to the airport personnel to identify the root causes of an airport's poor performance and suggest avenues to alleviate the problematic areas (Pandey, 2016).====The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In section 2, a detailed review on the applications of various MCDM techniques for performance assessment of airports of different countries is provided, and some quantitative information regarding air traffic movements in India is highlighted in Section 3. Section 4 deals with the mathematical details of BWM and MABAC techniques. The performance of 32 Indian international airports is appraised in Section 5 and Section 6 provides the discussions about the derived results.

It aims to improve the operational ability and the predictability of air traffic. In this paper, a novel automated data-driven framework to deal with the prediction of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) on the runway at the entry point of Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) is introduced. The proposed framework mainly consists of data preprocessing and machine learning models. Firstly, the dataset is divided, analyzed, cleaned, and estimated. Then, the flights are clustered into partitions according to different runway-in-use (QFU). Several candidate machine learning models are trained and selected on the corresponding dataset of each QFU. Feature engineering is conducted to transform raw data into features. After that, the experiments are performed on real ADS-B data in Beijing TMA with nested cross validation. By comparing the prediction performance on the preprocessed and un-preprocessed datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed data preprocessing is able to improve the data quality. It is also robust to outliers, ====, and noise. Finally, an ensemble learning strategy named stacking is introduced. Compared to other individual models, the stacked model has a more complex structure and performs best in ETA prediction. This fact reveals that the framework proposed in this study could make accurate and reliable ETA predictions.","4D trajectory and flight information are crucial factors for the Trajectory Based Operation (TBO) and Collaborative Decision Making (CDM). Highly accurate 4D Trajectory Prediction (TP) capability is the cornerstone of TBO deployment. Through accurate 4D TP, the air traffic operational efficiency could be improved. The flight cost and adverse environmental impact could also be lowered. More importantly, the workload of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCO) could be alleviated, which means that the maximum Air Traffic Management (ATM) capacity could be augmented (Enea and Porretta, 2012).====Previous studies on TP could be divided into model-driven methods and data-driven methods. Classical model-based TP methods made the ideal assumptions about the motion of the aircraft, the atmospheric environment, and the flight performance, along with either parametric or physics-based trajectory models. They generally do not take the intersections between different trajectories and the real Air Traffic Control (ATC) human behavior factors into account. In addition, lacking sufficient data support, computation resources, and learning ability, the model-based TP method is much less effective when facing massive real-time data in large-scale ATM systems. To overcome the drawbacks of model-driven approaches, nowadays, the focus of 4D TP has been gradually shifted to data-driven approaches.====The Data-driven AiRcraft Trajectory prediction research (DART) project is one of the recently launched research projects supported by SESAR joint undertaking, aiming to explore the applicability of data-driven approaches to the ATM domain (Dart - data-driven aircra). As pointed by DART, data-driven techniques are able to train appropriate models from all relevant and actual historical data with no or few prior assumptions and few requirements for data quality. Compared to classical model-driven approaches, contextual features can be extracted, including ATC information, meteorological condition, human factors, which will be beneficial in modeling the ATM socio-technical system and taking operational constraints into account.====Machine learning models are the most prevailing techniques in data-driven approaches. They have solid and widely accepted mathematical foundations and can provide insights on the air traffic dynamics (Ghasemi Hamed et al., 2013; Kun and Wei, 2008; de Leege et al., 2013; Hong and Lee, 2015; Tastambekov et al., 2014; Le Fablec and Alliot, 1999; Alligier et al., 2015a, 2015b; Wang et al., 2017). However, most prediction models have difficulties in handling 4D TP scenarios with high-complexity, multi-dimensions and high-nonlinearity. A well-performed prediction framework is supposed to deal with outliers, missing, or noisy data (Karlaftis and Vlahogianni, 2011). In addition, some studies require complicated preprocessing steps, which are trade-offs between prediction performance and computational efficiency, which need to be weighed carefully. Furthermore, most current models lack generalizability and automaticity. They are only applicable to one or a few flights, aircraft types, or departure/arrival procedures. If the problem is extended to other flights, airports, airspaces, or scenarios, the defined model architectures and parameters need to be greatly modified. Last but not least, the data used in some researches are not openly shared due to security reasons and business interests. Some other flight data sources, e.g., Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data, Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data, are not possible to implement real-time 4D TP.====The objective of this paper is to improve ETA prediction accuracy by means of data preprocessing and machine learning. The trade-off between computational efficiency and prediction performance is also studied. Based on open historical ADS-B data of BCIA, 6 machine learning models are applied to predict the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) of flights on the runway at the entry point of Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA). Due to complex traffic patterns, meteorological conditions, ATC command, and human behavior, the entry point is one of the most challenging and important areas for ETA prediction. Besides, the information at the entry of TMA is of great interest to the controllers (ATCO). Several preliminary efforts have been made by authors. For example (Wang et al., 2017), introduced an ETA trajectory prediction framework, including clustering-based preprocessing and Multi-Cells Neural Networks (MCNNs). However, this model is not fully automated. Firstly, only flights with the same magnetic orientation of the runway in use (QFU) can be handled by the model. If flights with multiple QFUs are taken into account, the trajectories will overlap and mix, which will greatly bring difficulties for the clustering algorithm to extract meaningful traffic patterns. Secondly, hyperparameters need to be retuned if we generalize the model to other TMAs. As an extension of (Wang et al., 2018), this paper refines and optimizes the preprocessing steps. In the prediction section, more prevailing machine learning models are compared. Moreover, a more powerful ensemble learning strategy named stacking is utilized in this study. As a result, a more powerful ETA prediction framework is proposed.====The main contributions of this paper could be listed as the following:",Automated data-driven prediction on aircraft Estimated Time of Arrival,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719304429,19 July 2020,2020,Research Article,349.0

The International Air Transport Association (====) expects that the COVID-19 crisis will see airline passenger revenues drop by US$314 billion in 2020, which would represent a 55 percent decline compared to 2019. This estimate is based on a scenario with severe travel restrictions lasting three months (====). It could even be worse, with extended restrictions or, in the case of a new virus outbreak, even new restrictions.====“When a crisis occurs, it usually arrives as a barrage of urgent, unexpected and unpleasant events, allowing little time to organize or plan appropriate responses” (====, p. 12).

In Europe, the Dutch, French, German, and Italian governments are handing out billions of Euros to their national airlines, even under the auspices of the European Commission (e.g., ====). In Europe, this represents a major policy turn: after more than two decades of retreating (e.g., ====), the gates for (financial) government intervention are open again, justified by the unprecedented magnitude of the SARS CoV-2-induced crisis. Yet, even extraordinary crises only last for a limited timespan; exceptional measures will not prevail forever. At some point, societies will resume, maybe in the frequently cited “new normal”, whatever this might look like. Assuming that, in the post-COVID-19 era, airlines will not have returned to the status of state-owned companies, or even divisions of national transport administrations, we argue that the measures being taken currently will have repercussions for the industry that emerges from the crisis, and after the crisis. It is already becoming clear now – in early June 2020, not even three months since the introduction of lockdown measures – that the competitive landscape of the European airline industry will change. Despite airlines' comprehensible immediate and almost unanimous attempts to minimize cash burn in the revenue-stifling crisis, their behavior has varied significantly as the crisis extends (e.g., Air France–KLM retiring their A380 fleet prematurely (====) vs. Wizz Air planning to expand into new European markets after the crisis (====)), which will influence their competitive positioning in the “new normal” industry landscape.

It appears both the nature of the indicators and thresholds have been the subject of debate by EU Ministers and MPs, while Flanders has imposed a dose-effect function that is arguably outdated and unusable in specific cases. Finally, we discuss the results through the lens of the authoritative power of official noise indicators and related maps, which many journalists and scholars take for granted. All this contributes to the construction of distorted knowledge of noise issues and calls for a re-evaluation of the EU's and Flanders' noise indicators.","Aircraft noise in the vicinity of airports has become a commonplace environmental and health issue (Franssen et al., 2004; Basner et al., 2010; Kaltenbach et al., 2008; WHO, 2009; EEA, 2010). Exposure to aircraft noise results in cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, adverse birth outcomes, annoyance, sleep disturbance, and hearing impairment. It also affects quality of life, well-being and mental health (WHO, 2018). Traffic growth, expanding (sub)urbanisation, permissive land planning, increased sensitivity of residents to noise and higher legitimacy of environmental protests have made the conflicts increasingly visible, even though the specific noise level per aircraft has decreased (Bröer, 2007; Babisch et al., 2009; Daley, 2010; Rodríguez-Díaz et al., 2017). Conflicts between residents and the aviation industry, with public authorities in the middle, have forced the latter to react. In short, inhabitants are challenging a business activity that emits significant levels of daytime noise as well as overnight noise in many cases. On the other hand, the aviation industry (airlines, airports and aircraft/engine manufacturers) claims its business is an integral part of economic development, employment, trade, connectivity, leisure and cultural experiences as well as social coherence. Public authorities are caught between these two conflicting views. While their representatives often agree air services bring social and economic benefits, they cannot ignore the negative externalities their voters bear. In this context, one way to sit on the fence without being disruptive is to conduct noise assessments and hold local community consultations.====Accordingly, various national and international public bodies have imposed regular assessments of noise around airports. In so doing, they have imposed standardised methods that specify how noise must be estimated and how the results have to be rendered. Typically, noise is estimated through models fed by traffic data, routes’ profile, aircraft characteristics and weather conditions (see ECAC, 2016 and below). The results usually include average noise indicators that are mapped as noise contours. The number of noise events may be considered too, and all indicators tend to be required for various times during the day (e.g. day/night or day/evening/night).====Surprisingly, these noise indicators are rarely questioned (Pronello and Camusso, 2012). The fact that public authorities have coded noise indicators through legislation seems enough to legitimize them to policy makers and scholars. One notable exception is a qualitative study conducted by Cidell (2008), who demonstrated that there are local residents living outside Minneapolis – St Paul International Airport's official noise contours (or within lower-level noise contours), who nevertheless have reported that they suffer from aircraft noise pollution. This suggests that official noise assessment does not sufficiently cover all aspects of noise pollution, such as the perceived annoyance induced by aviation operations.====In contrast to transportation studies, scholars in other fields, such as environmental sociology or politics, usually acknowledge that environmental indicators are everything but politically neutral (Turnhout et al., 2007). In the same vein, scholars engaged in critical cartography have helped to demonstrate maps are not more neutral (Harley, 1988). An increasing number of scholars and government statisticians have become aware that social, economic, environmental and health indicators are the result of political compromises that should be reviewed. Such a trend towards more critical governmental statistics does not seem to have reached transportation studies, in which the politics of official indicators remain significantly unexplored.====In this context, our paper aims to critically analyse aviation noise assessments and to demonstrate that existing methods in Europe lack neutrality and tend to lower the number of inhabitants affected by aircraft noise. In conducting this analysis, we bring to transportation studies the lessons resulting from a) the critical “politics of large numbers” (Desrosières, 1998), b) environmental socio-politics related to the science-vs.-policy dilemma of environmental indicators (Turnhout et al., 2007) and c) critical cartography (Harley, 1988). In this process, we will consider the case of the European Union's (EU) and Flanders' mandatory noise indicators applied to Brussels Airport (Belgium).====The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3 explains our research strategy. Section 4 introduces mandatory methods of airport noise assessment imposed by the EU and Flanders, as well as our Brussels Airport case study. The results can be found in Section 5, where three directions are proposed: the spatial mismatch between official noise contours and protests; the high sensitivity of noise contours to their definition; and the political nature of noise assessment. The last section discusses the results through the lens of the authoritative power of official noise indicators, and concludes with recommendations for future studies.",When environmental indicators are not neutral: Assessing aircraft noise assessment in Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720301617,11 July 2020,2020,Research Article,351.0

The aim of the article was to check the impact of social distance on the performance of security control lanes. Different ways of passenger flow across the lane were compared. The model was verified on actual data. The results obtained indicate that it is better to use lanes with a dedicated service area for each passenger on Entry Area than a free flow along the lane. This knowledge is extremely important for security checkpoint designers. It will help ensure proper performance under normal conditions and limit performance losses under epidemic conditions. The results were also divided according to different structure of the passenger stream (percentage share of flags, lowcost and charter operations). The results showed that this has a significant impact on efficiency.","Hardly anyone expected that the COVID-19 epidemic would have such a big impact on the functioning of the air transport system. Preliminary scientific research conducted by virologists (====). Before the outbreak of the epidemic, about 30,000 aircraft took off daily; this value was only about 2500 daily in March, April and May (====).====Restoration of air traffic depends on several factors: government restrictions and guidelines on air traffic, demand for air services and ticket prices. However, a key aspect that airport managers and airline managers will have to face is how to ensure the safety of passengers and persuade them to use air transport again in an epidemic situation. There are general regulatory guidelines for airport passenger service (====). Mandatory temperature check for passengers at the entrance of the passenger terminal and appropriate distancing have been introduced.====One of the systems where hygiene and social distance are difficult to meet is security checkpoint. According to the research, this process is one of the more stressful service processes (====). In this situation, it is easy for a passenger as well as a security control operator to make a mistake and not meet epidemic requirements and contribute to the transmission of COVID-19. Maintaining proper distancing and hygiene rules (e.g. disinfection of hands as well as X-ray trays) is crucial for the safe implementation of the safety control process.====The infrastructure of the current security control systems (e.g. length of conveyors, number of technical devices) guaranteed adequate performance under the assumptions of no distancing and other epidemic requirements (====). The application of social distance has resulted in significantly reduced passenger numbers in each area of the security control lane. ==== made an analysis which directly showed that this factor has a key impact on reduction of system performance. Therefore, social distance has a significant impact on reducing the performance of the security control lane and this has also been proven in this article. Corrective actions must be put in place to maintain the high performance of security control lane in epidemic state. Two solutions may be introduced. First of these assumes that passengers will be forced to be at the airport much earlier. Then there is more time to handle them. But then it will not reduce the number of people in the queue, where the COVID-19 transmissions may occur. The second solution is to try to increase the performance of the system in a state of epidemic. And that's what this article deals with.====This article presents a simulation model which has been applied to analyse the impact of the application of social distance on the performance of the security control lane at the airport. This topic was taken up in order to establish a structure of security control lane that will be both efficient during normal operation and efficient in an epidemic. Such an analysis has not yet been done in literature, because there was no such demand. Now this subject is extremely important to the proper functioning of the airport.====Chapter 2 presents an overview of literature related to the subject under consideration. Chapter 3 contains a formal description of the security control lane model. The validation of the model are presented in Chapter 4. Simulation experiments and recommendations on the configuration of an airport security control lane in an epidemic situation were also ultimately presented as a scientific contribution in Chapter 5. The own configuration of the security control lane was developed and its performance was tested by simulation.

These criteria are both objective - precisely quantifiable, and subjective - requiring descriptive assessment by experts. The purpose of this article was to make a multi-criteria assessment of variants of the modernization of the HBSS, considering various points of view of experts and the context of decisions made. Due to the existence of both the criteria described using ==== and those dependent on complex random processes, both fuzzy inference methods and simulation methods based on microscale models were used. The developed method was implemented to assess the modernization variants for Katowice International Airport. The highest score resulting from the group decision-making was obtained by the modernization variant consisting in reducing the number of baggage control levels with the simultaneous increase in the number of people performing manual checks. If we consider a different decision-making process environment, the group's preferred variant changes. For example, for the scenario involving a significant increase in the size of the traffic being handled, the variant of doubling X-ray devices at the first level of control becomes the most advantageous. The change in the group preference, depending on the context of the decision-making situation, clearly indicates that this context must be taken into account in the decision-making process. The proposed method allows one not only to indicate the preferred variant in each scenario but also to numerically determine the strength of preferences for individual variants, which may facilitate making the right decision considering the chances for implementation of individual scenarios.","The airport security level consists of many elements that together form a coherent protection system. All these elements are important to ensure the safety of aviation operations in accordance with the standards described in the legal regulations on civil aviation security. These standards only indicate the minimum requirements that should be met in the field of airport security. However, they do not define a detailed way of organizing the airport security system, leaving this issue to the airport management. Thanks to this, the airport management can adapt their terminal infrastructure to the quality parameters, such as passenger satisfaction (Gilbert and Wong, 2003), appropriate for the specificity of the airport.====Planning an airport development taking these parameters into account is extremely difficult if the management does not have precise values determining the effect depending on the scope of the implemented changes. We say then that the decision is taken under uncertainty. Such uncertain values include the estimated costs of the proposed solutions. Given the several years of planning perspective, it is not possible to determine these costs precisely. They depend on the traffic volume or future formal requirements, which are currently impossible to predict. Therefore, these estimates must consider the subjective belief of the expert regarding the further development of the aviation market, labor costs, changes in regulations, etc. The question arises – is it better to accept only one estimate made by the representative of the airport managers (who make decisions), or several estimates made by experts (representatives of various fields)? On the other hand – is it better to express the belief about the further development of the situation (in this case, about the costs) in the form of exact numbers (which are uncertain) or preferably in natural language applying soft computing methods adequate to this approach? Considering the specificity of the problem and the high qualifications of the experts used, representing different points of view, we have chosen the procedure of making group decisions with opinions expressed partly in natural language and their analysis using fuzzy methods.====This problem is very noticeable in the systems responsible for the safety of passengers using the airport. One of them is the Hold Baggage Screening System (HBSS), which requires the involvement of a specific space in the airport terminal infrastructure and significant financial investment related to, among other things, the purchase and operation of specialized equipment to check the contents of the passengers' baggage. A high level of effectiveness in the detection of prohibited articles is required, as the admission of a dangerous object or substance on board may be disastrous for passengers. On the other hand, detailed control of hold baggage is time-consuming, and the extended duration of this process significantly affects the capacity of the baggage handling system and, consequently, the entire airport. This, in turn, is of great importance from the point of view of airport development. Planning the HBSS is, therefore, an activity based on searching a balance between the effectiveness of protection against acts of unlawful interference, the capacity and the financial result of the airport. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to involve in the decision-making process not only people responsible for security, who will naturally seek to implement the latest and most advanced technologies, but also those responsible for adjusting and maintaining the entire airport infrastructure and the financial result of the company.====In practice, decisions are often taken on a one-person basis. In this case, mainly the decision-maker's point of view is taken into consideration, which may, for example, consider that the most important are the costs and choose the cheapest option, minimizing the role of other criteria. The essence of the proposed method is considering the opinion of specialists in various aspects that may be relevant here. And so were the experts selected in our case study. They were representatives of the management staff responsible for specialist issues. Thus, it is possible to consider quite different points of view. Therefore, some expert assessments presented in the example are somewhat divergent. For example, for a specialist responsible for ensuring the technical continuity of the HBSS system, investment costs are less important than for the airport owner. Does this mean, however, that this point of view is less important? Definitely not, because in the case of adopting the low-reliability variant, the costs of HBSS downtime may be unacceptable. Therefore, the inclusion of such a point of view is essential. The method proposed by us allows this approach.====The fact that some values are determined based on expert opinions does not mean that we are dealing with hypotheses. The essence of the problem is that it is not possible to define all parameters of the model precisely. Decision-making situations in which it is not possible to accurately identify some variables are relatively frequent. Replacing uncertain values with arbitrarily set “exact” values is not the right solution. It is better to be aware of the uncertainty of input data and take this into account by using the appropriate soft computational methods, as in our method – the fuzzy arithmetic. Otherwise, we use hard mathematical methods for hard input data, which, however, may not be valid.====Planning the development of an airport in the context of the HBSS system is, therefore, a process whose outcome is a resultant of the factors described above. This paper presents a method of group evaluation of the hold baggage screening system considering several evaluation criteria, selected as a result of empirical research into the development process and modernization of hold baggage screening systems. It provides decision-makers with a tool to consciously plan HBSS configuration to obtain the required output parameters. The method was computer-implemented, and the possibility of its application to the process of making modernization decisions was presented using the example of the Katowice Airport in Pyrzowice.====The problem under consideration is entirely practical. The subject matter came from the need to evaluate the actually planned modernization options at Katowice Airport. The article compares the existing variant of the HBSS system organization and the three proposed extension options that are considered by the airport managers for practical implementation.",Multi-criteria group decision-making approach to the modernization of hold baggage security screening system at an airport,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719302042,10 July 2020,2020,Research Article,353.0

They play an important role in ensuring happiness among travelers (Foxe, 2016). Consequently, enhancing the positive emotions of flight attendants is widely considered the most important issue for the airline industry. Southwest Airlines, ranked second in Business Insider's list of best U.S. airlines, emphasized that happy employees create happiness for both their customers and shareholders (O'Reilly and Pfeffer, 2000). However, the job obligations of customer-contact employees take precedence over their non-work activities (e.g., Byrne and Canato, 2017; Lu et al., 2016; Sonnengtag and Natter, 2004). For example, flight attendants' uncertain work schedules are characterized by unplanned landings, deadhead/repositioning flights, flight delays or cancellations, replacing unexpectedly absent colleagues (Fu, 2013; Kim and Back, 2012; Sonnengtag and Natter, 2004). These unexpected demands result in inability to fulfill family-related responsibilities (Hu and Ho, 2016; Sonnengtag and Natter, 2004), thus negatively impacting on flight attendants' attitudes, job performance (Gittell, 2005), and wellbeing (Lu et al., 2016).====Therefore, airlines must build a working environment that promoting bright side of work-family interface, thereby enhancing positive wellbeing for flight attendants. Indeed, a working environment that balances work and non-work aspects can enhance flight attendants' work engagement (Byrne and Canato, 2017; Xanthopoulou et al., 2008) and benefit their health and productivity (Cheng et al., 2018). For example, Southwest Airlines became one of the most successful U.S. airlines due to its highly motivated and productive workforce, resulting from work- and family-friendly practices (e.g., shift trading, negotiable work rules) that foster flexibility in flight attendants’ work schedules and a working culture that fosters mutual respect and effective communication across teams (e.g., see Bansal et al., 2001; Gittell, 2005).====Internal marketing refers to a service management approach that regards all employees, especially those engaged in customer contact, as internal customers, and aims to motivate them to behave in a service-oriented manner (Fu, 2013; Kaurav et al., 2015; Rafiq and Ahmed, 2000). Previous studies have stated that the focus of internal marketing is to identify and satisfy employees' needs and wants (Dabholkar and Abston, 2008; Lings and Greenley, 2005), with the aim of increasing the service quality offered by internal customers external customers (Rafiq and Ahmed, 2000). Thus, a full understanding of the relationship between internal marketing and the work–family interface is critical for improving flight attendants' wellbeing. This study employs affective event theory (AET) to illustrate the relationship among internal marketing, the work–family interface, and employee happiness. AET refers to affective events, predicted by environmental features, are portrayed as the proximal causes of employees' emotions/moods (e.g., joy, depression, anger, fear, and frustration) that, in turn, determine work outcomes, such as employee attitude/behavior (Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996) or employee performance (Robbins and Judge, 2011). This study, therefore, postulates that internal marketing activities and the work–family interface may be potential antecedents to flight attendants’ psychological state==== Recent studies in the airline context, based on the AET framework, have explored the environment–emotion–behavior chain by examining environmental features/work events (e.g., perceived organizational support, family-supportive organization perception) as the cause of work outcomes (e.g., turnover intention, service quality) through affective mediation (Hu and Ho, 2016; Hur et al., 2013). However, there has been little empirical research on either the environment–emotion or the environment–event–emotion chain, especially regarding to the functions/positions in aviation industry (e.g., flight attendants, technicians) (Hu and Ho, 2016). Therefore, using a sample of flight attendants, this study attempts to enrich AET-based literature by clarifying the mediating role of the work–family interface (regular event) including work-family conflict (WFC) and work-family facilitation (WFF) in the relationship between internal marketing (environmental feature) and employee happiness (affective reaction).====This study is also underpinned by the job demands–resources (JD-R) model. According to the JD-R model, the work environment of an employee dealing with information and people is characterized by job resources and demands (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017). Job resources and demands are defined as those physical, psychological, social, and organizational aspects of the job (Demerouti et al., 2001; Schaufeli and Taris, 2014) that have casual and reverse-casual effects (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017). In particular, job resources (e.g., feedback, social support, autonomy in scheduling work tasks) are needed to: (1) achieve work goals; (2) reduce job demands and psychological costs; and (3) stimulate personal growth and development; by contrast, job demands (e.g., interpersonal conflict, irregular working hours, work overload) are linked to psychological costs (Demerouti et al., 2001; Demerouti and Bakker, 2011; Karatepe and Eslamlou, 2017; Schaufeli and Taris, 2014). The understanding of psychological mechanism explaining the ==== between job resources and job demands remains unclear (Baeriswyl et al., 2016; Bakker and Demerouti, 2017; Chen et al., 2015), particularly with respect to organization-based resources (Hur et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2015). This study attempts to fill this gap by using internal marketing as an organizational job resource and explaining its positive relation to employees’ happiness through the mediating effect of the work–family interface as job demands.====Internal marketing focuses on the relationship between management and frontline staff (Kaurav et al., 2015). Most empirical internal marketing studies, summarized in Table 1, have used a sample of frontline staff in service-providing organizations, such as international hotels (Huang and Rundle-Thiele, 2014; To et al., 2015), financial companies (Kadic-Maglajlic et al., 2018), casino companies (Back et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2016), and restaurants (Choi and Joung, 2017; Joung et al., 2015) (see the details in Table 1). Internal marketing, as shown in Table 1, is portrayed as a useful tool for service-oriented businesses in creating positive outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational commitment, work attitude/behavior) in frontline employees yet few empirical findings have uncovered whether internal marketing activities promote employees' happiness to date. Additionally, few investigations have explored the role of internal marketing using a sample of flight attendants despite the fact that flight attendants play a critical role in making travelers happy. In sum, this study attempts to explore the relationship between internal marketing and flight attendants' happiness, and the mediating effect of the work–family interface. Its findings should increase understanding of the effectiveness of internal marketing for enhancing flight attendants’ wellbeing.",How to create genuine happiness for flight attendants: Effects of internal marketing and work-family interface,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719305915,7 July 2020,2020,Research Article,354.0

Upon investigation, we find that all the parameters linearly impact the vehicle utilization, while other measures are robust, specifically with respect to the seating capacity. It is also recommended to operate initially with 70 air taxis in NYC to achieve a trade-off between customer wait time and vehicle utilization. The proposed approach can act as a recommender system for air taxi companies.","The concept of shared mobility is not only widely investigated at the ground-level but is also explored aerially for customer transportation, and is referred to as the “urban air mobility” (Al Haddad et al., 2020). Over the past decade, the aviation industry has radically expanded (Matsumoto and Domae, 2018), and Miyoshi et al. (2018) reported a steady rise in air transportation demand, averaging over 4–5% per year. In an attempt to leverage this growing market, several logistics companies are in the process of designing air taxis. Air taxi, an emerging method of urban air mobility, is projected to launch in the coming years in large cities as an effective, fast, and reliable mode of transportation.====These flying vehicles are expected to be implemented by international companies, such as Airbus, Uber, and Kitty Hawk (Hawkins, 2018; Warwick, 2018). Although intense research on the design front is being pursued by several, including the aforementioned logistics companies, the local governments are still in the process of discussing the planning and integration of this new emerging method of commute (Garrett-Glaser, 2019). Thus, the need to study air taxi network operations to provide recommendations for operators, investors, and city planners is essential.====Air taxi services operate similar to that of helicopters; they require a launch/landing pad and a certified pilot. Using the Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) technologies, air taxis will use landing platforms that exist on top of parking garages and other tall buildings with available roof space. These infrastructures can be split into two different types; vertistop and vertiport (Smith, 1994; Patnoe, 2018; Hasan, 2019). Vertistop is a single launch pad facility where customers quickly exchange between drop off and pick up. Whereas, vertiport is a larger site with several landing pads, and also supports the air taxis with charging and repair facilities (Holden and Goel, 2016). Since these air taxis are electric and are expected to fly noiselessly, they could be implemented in urban residential areas, as well (Holden et al., 2018). In comparison to helicopters, air taxis are anticipated to emit less CO==== and operate at relatively reduced costs in order to benefit the environment and the economy.====Although air taxis appear to be a potential solution to ameliorate traffic congestion, there are several challenges that companies could face during its implementation. First, it is necessary to determine the location of vertiport and vertistop facilities since many factors play a role in determining the optimal placement of these sites. For instance, it is essential to consider whether the chosen locations can handle the customer demand density, possess the potential to accommodate future customers, and proximity to the road (Holden et al., 2018).====Second, routing and tracking air taxis through airways involve greater risks, higher security, and more coordination. In order to operate with safety at the same time efficiently, a flawless control system and staff are required. Third, companies would have to use data analytic techniques in real-time to predict the demand for this aviation service, based on factors like the hour of the day or geographical location. Fourth, other operational aspects, such as pricing, maintenance, delivery options, and battery conditions, could cause a threat to the upcoming service (Falck et al., 2018; Rajendran and Zack, 2019).====Fifth, for aircraft, environmental or weather conditions have to be considered to operate safely within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines. The main weather aspects to be considered are icing, wind shear, and visibility. For intracity air operations, the FAA currently requires 500 feet of clearance from any structure for safe operations (Federal Aviation Administration, 2020). In the event of low visibility or high wind shear, pilots will still need to maintain safe distances from structures. Wind shearing will likely be the most hindering weather condition that operators will have to adapt to due to its variability and unpredictability. For departures, high winds can be especially detrimental and may lead to aircraft grounding until conditions are deemed safe. Specifically, vertistop locations in dense urban areas may experience crosswinds created by tall buildings or structures.====This research focuses on understanding the air taxi operations to determine the number of vehicles required to fulfill the demand for UAM in New York City (NYC). We accomplish this objective by developing a Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify (DMADV) framework. The demand for this research is obtained from a prior study (Rajendran and Zack, 2019) that takes a subset of regular taxi customers who are eligible to avail the air taxi service based on certain parameters (such as travel distance and time).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The review of the literature pertaining to air taxis and similar studies are presented in Section 2. The system overview is described in Section 3, while the methodology is discussed in Section 4.

One passenger segment that has received relatively little attention is ageing passengers (defined as aged 65+), in spite of the fact that this group has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and in recent years has been viewed as a potential growth market. Therefore, the aim of this brief paper is to analyse the attitudes of ageing passengers by assessing air travel plans in the next 12 months, examining the factors influencing future flying decisions, and investigating the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on perceived risks and experiences associated with flying. The findings show that over 60% of ageing passengers are planning to travel by air in the next 12 months, although the nature of their trips may change. Factors such as flexible ticket booking and quarantine rules do not appear to be key drivers affecting travel decisions and within the different stages of the air journey, getting to/from the airport is perceived as the safest stage. The findings suggest that there are various COVID-19 implications for airlines and airports serving this market segment, ranging from the use of self-service technology, the generation of commercial/ancillary revenues and the design of surface access policies.","; International Air Transport Association ====; Airports Council International ==== forecasts that air transport will not recover to 2019 levels until 2023 whilst ==== have identified mid-2022 as being the most optimistic date for full recovery, with 2026 being the most pessimistic estimate.====In order for passengers to travel they need to perceive it as being safe, have the confidence to travel and there needs to be favourable economic conditions. Even though the pandemic is a very recent development, a number of academic papers have already been published assessing the impact on air travel and tourism demand (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Moreover, behavioural factors, in particular, have received considerable attention in the travel and tourism industry, which is awash with consumer surveys. For example, globally, IATA, has been undertaking an online survey of passengers of 11 different countries in every two months (====) and ==== has been reporting on a weekly travel insights survey. Within individual countries, a number of other travel and tourism surveys have been undertaken. For example, in the UK which is the focus of this research, ==== has been producing a weekly consumer tracker report in this area.====However, within this growing set of air transport and coronavirus research, it is very rare to find any specific mention of ageing passengers - defined here as the 65+ age group - and their behavioural influences. This age group is particularly important since it is the most vulnerable as regards to being affected by COVID-19. Indeed, of the deaths registered in the UK involving COVID-19 between March and May, 15% were amongst the 65–74 age range, 32% (75–84 ages) and 42% (85+ ages) (Office for National Statistics ====).====, ====; ====). The latest available trip participation data for 2014 showed that 40% of UK residents aged 65–74 took at least one air trip. Moreover, tourists aged 65 or over accounted for nearly one in four tourism nights for private purposes by EU residents in 2018 (====). The growing potential of the market was increasingly recognised by the academic literature, albeit limited in volume (e.g. ====; ====, ====; ====; ====). The research has acknowledged some of the key challenges faced by the air travel and tourism industry in serving this segment, especially as a higher proportion of such passengers are disabled or have underlying health problems compared with other age groups (====; ====; ====; ====).====Hence the paucity of air travel research examining the ageing market and coronavirus pandemic provides the motivation for this paper, as this age group has been disproportionally affected by COVID-19, and in recent years has been viewed as a potential growth market. Therefore, the aim of the research is to analyse the attitudes of ageing passengers to air travel since the coronavirus pandemic. This has been achieved through undertaking an online consumer survey to achieve the following objectives:====The UK has been chosen as a representative market as the ==== of the UK population are akin to that of other developed and mature aviation markets.

Regarding earnings predictability, we find evidence of deterioration in oil-volatile quarters as indicated by both the earnings variability based on common benchmarks and the quality of analyst forecasts issued early in the quarter.

First, as discussed in Carter et al. (2006), the airline industry is competitive and remarkably homogeneous with a single, volatile input cost in jet fuel that cannot easily pass through to customers. As oil prices fluctuate, jet fuel costs vary, so do the airline's operating costs and net profitability. Further, oil price movements, especially the demand-side oil shocks (e.g., Kilian, 2009) driven by shifting economic conditions, could coincide with changing demands of air travel, creating yet another layer of uncertainty for the airline's financial performance. The uncertainty from other factors, such as the airline's responses to the changing environment, often surges during a period of volatile oil prices, further hampering airline earnings predictability.====In this study, we empirically examine the impact of oil price dynamics on airline earnings and their predictability, as indicated by earnings variability based on common benchmarks and analyst forecast quality. Further, we explicitly take into account that not all oil shocks are alike (Kilian, 2009), and examine the different impact of supply- and demand-driven oil shocks.",Oil price dynamics and airline earnings predictability,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720300302,29 June 2020,2020,Research Article,357.0

Analytical methods adapted for service quality (SQ) assessments are comprehended. This paper identifies emerging Stratified SQ indicators and stochastic approaches for performance evaluation considering the spatial, operational and technological transformations of PTBs. Critical gaps from literature and scope for further research are discussed.","Aviation industry has experienced a massive growth the since the 1970s. Transportation Research Board (TRB) infers that there has been a twelvefold increase in the total passengers enplaned in the past 47 years (TRB, 2018a). The growing competition amidst the airline sector has led to decreased airfares and have triggered an increase in passenger flow at the terminals (Chien-Chang, 2012). Introduction of low-cost air carriers, budget terminals (Pabedinskaitė and Akstinaitė, 2014) and increasing the daily flight volume have further augmented landside terminal congestion and capacity constraints at the airport terminals (Müller and Gosling, 1991). The uneven growth has created an imbalance between the available terminal infrastructure and the number of passengers (Bezerra and Gomes, 2016; Pandey, 2016) thus causing a stress on quality of passenger experience at the terminals and overall functional efficiency. This has increased the interest of airport management to focus on passenger-based revenue (airport tax) more than the airline-based revenue (leasing). It is anticipated that soon airline passengers will turn out to be the major stakeholders of the airline industry (Isaka, 2013). Commercialization and Privatization of airports also aggregated the need to evaluate the performance and quality of services provided to its users (Oum et al., 2003; Suárez-Alemán and Jiménez, 2016; Pagliari and Graham, 2019).====The standards developed by the international agencies such as International Air Transport Association (IATA), Transport Canada (1979), British Airport Authority (BAA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Aeroport de Paris have been widely adopted by the airports worldwide for its internal assessments (IATA, 2004; Neufville et al., 2003). However, they have been contested for the non-inclusion of passenger perceptions (Ashford, 1988; Correia and Wirasinghe, 2004; Correia et al., 2008a; Omer and Khan, 1988; Park, 1999; Yeh and Kuo, 2003). Though numerous studies have evaluated the functional performance at airport terminals using passenger perceptions, uncertainty still exists in the selection of evaluation criteria. To address this gap, an attempt has been made in this paper to review and comprehend the existing literature on the various performance indicators and research techniques for evaluating functional efficiency in airport terminals.",Functional efficiency in airport terminals: A review on Overall and Stratified Service Quality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719306210,28 June 2020,2020,Research Article,358.0

In this study, we introduce the airline bank optimisation problem with a novel mathematical model for improving flight connection times. The mathematical model aims to minimise the total connection times for transfer passengers and generates flight schedules regarding slot capacities in the hub airports. Since the problem is a combinatorial optimisation problem NP-hard and computational complexity increases rapidly for real-world problems, we employ the simulated annealing and the ==== search algorithms to achieve better solutions in a reasonable time. We generate sub-problems using real-world data and investigate the effectiveness of the algorithms. Finally, we present the results of a real case study of a Turkish airline company which has a hub airport connecting the flights between Middle Eastern and European cities.","Commercial airlines use optimisation methods to efficiently allocate their resources in order to compete in the growing air transportation industry. An airline's most important assets are its aircraft and its most important product is its schedule. Full service carriers have changed their business models and schedules from ‘point to point’ to ‘hub and spoke’ (HS) in order to serve growing passenger demand and to achieve higher levels of profit and resource utilisation, depending on global liberalisation developments in the last 30 years. Even though some airlines currently operate through the point to point business model, major airlines such as Delta, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, Emirates and Singapore Airlines work on a HS system with flights through hub airports and transfer passengers from spoke cities to their final destinations. In order to manage the passenger transfer flow, these airline companies create flight clusters in a so-called bank structure in their hub airports. We illustrate the bank structure of a representative hub airport in Fig. 1 where number arrival and departure flights are summarised in the bank structure. For this hub airport, general passenger flows are considered from East to West. In Fig. 1, the flights arrive hub airport from eastern cities, lays over for a short time between 05:00–08:00 am., then leaves the airport with local and transfer passengers to arrive western destinations (i.e. Europe, United States of America). Analogues bank structures may be repeated 2–4 times in a 24-h period.====Bank structures are an essential part of HS networks. They have provided rapid growth for the airline companies that utilise HS in their networks (Gillen and Morrison, 2005). Bank structures increase the connectivity of spoke cities, increase traffic demand, lower cost and increase asset utilisation by decreasing the number of routes that require connected city pairs. They allow operational robustness for crew planning, maintenance operations and routine checks of aircraft. However, bank structures can cause slot capacity problems in specific time periods. They increase demand for airport resources at the hub airport, as runways, taxiways and gates become over-congested during the bank timings. So, bank structure lead to inefficiency in operational activities because the capacity may become inadequate in bank-time periods and also may become idle in remaining time periods. Finally, bank structures are highly vulnerable to delays; any delay in one of the incoming segments may affect many segments in the outgoing bank cluster. Thus, recovering passengers’ schedules and having regular operation for crew and aircraft rotation can take hours in the case of a delay.====In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model to optimise the flight schedule of an airline at its hub airport regarding the bank structure. The goal is to design the flight bank with the optimal departure and arrival times of the flights in the predefined bank structure while shortening connection times between flights. This study proposes a mixed integer programming model that assigns arrival and departure flights to slots, so that the connecting flights generates higher revenue with shorter and more convenient connection times. The model considers the available slot capacity of the hub airport, the demand and the revenue of spoke airports. Moreover, the optimal assignment of flights to slots decreases the congestion level in the hub airport by providing a balanced distribution along the bank.====Exact algorithms typically take more time than heuristic methods to execute, as they are mathematically difficult to solve. Due to the complex, dynamic, competitive and highly regulated environment in the airline industry, complex operational issues require fast, efficient and responsive solutions. Therefore, we adapt two well-known meta-heuristic algorithms, tabu search (TS) and simulated annealing (SA), in order to obtain near-optimal solutions in a desirable runtime. Based on our empirical results, the proposed approach has the following advantages:====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review of studies on the HS systems in the aviation industry and introduces the bank optimisation problem with the concept of slot applications at the congested airports. In Section 3, we present a mathematical model for the bank optimisation problem and provide a review of applications of TS and SA algorithms in the airline optimisation literature. Section 4 provides a computational study on a set of sample problems and real-life example.

The results showed that there is a concern on the part of the airport regarding waste management, reflected in the Fuzzy Waste Management Index (FWMI) results. They also indicated that there was an improvement in waste management in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting from increased accounting for recyclables and awareness of the airport ====. The developed model proved to be an important tool to support the decision making of airport managers, including aspects related to waste management steps, and there may be adjustments that may be made to include new indicators.","Air transport plays an important role in the regional integration of a country, contributing to the economic and social development of local communities. About this, Olfat et al. (2016) highlighted that airports connect people and economies, and are crucial for increasing employment opportunities and for a country's gross domestic product (GDP) growth.====In addition, one must also consider the environmental issue to develop sustainable airports because it is the future of airport planning (Chao et al., 2017). Airports have an impact on the environment and inhabitants, demanding them to be environmentally and socially responsible.====According to the Airports Council International – North America (2017), sustainability in the airline industry is a concept that enhances an airport's economic, operational efficiency, conservation of natural resources, and social impact. In addition to major operations, airports are taking steps to increase environmental stewardship and seek to decouple economic growth from the environmental pressure involved (Kilkiş and Kilkiş, 2016).====The International Civil Airport Organization (ICAO, 2019), in its latest published environmental report, stated that environmentally responsible air travel is an essential component of sustainable industry growth. This reinforces the importance of discussing environmental issues at airports.====It is noteworthy that the impact of aviation on the environment is of growing concern, mainly due to the projected increase in demand for air transportation (Adler et al., 2013). Airports' main intention regards to environmental practices such as to reduce the use of resources and waste generation (Cairncross, 1995; Gilley et al., 2000).====Waste management is seen as one of the critical environmental issues facing airports (Baxter et al., 2018a), due to the large amount of waste produced by its many activities (Dimitriou and Voskaki, 2010). Therefore, airport waste management has a growing importance due to its significant increase in passenger numbers and, consequently, in the volume of waste generated (Baxter et al., 2018a).====According to Pitt and Smith (2003), waste management is mainly an environmental issue, despite having social and economic impacts. In accordance with the polluter pays principle, airports need to develop a complete waste management system, which includes waste separation at source and recycling, among other subsystems (Dimitriou and Voskaki, 2010).====Airports produce waste volumes equivalent to those generated by small towns (Pitt et al., 2002).For instance, Congonhas Airport (see item 2.1 – Object of the Study), one of the most busiest airports in Brazil, generated 1,516 tons of waste in 2014 (INFRAERO, 2015), similar amount collected by Brazilian cities of 6 thousand inhabitants. Brazilian cities with up to 25 thousand inhabitants generate, approximately, 0,7 kg/inh./day (CETESB, 2019). This means that these ventures have a considerable environmental impact on the regions in which they are located (Pitt and Smith, 2003). Waste are generated in quantities generally positively correlated with air traffic volumes (Janić, 2011).====Recent studies on waste management addressed aspects such as cost-benefit analysis of the organic waste life cycle (Lam et al., 2018), qualitative and quantitative analysis of waste management (Baxter et al., 2018a, 2018b), waste generation on board aircraft (Tofalli et al., 2018), waste management assessment (Carra et al., 2013) and airport waste generation (Kunz et al., 2015). These studies have some gaps to be explored, especially regarding the difficulty of developing indicators and achieving overall airport performance in waste management.====Based on the gaps found in airport waste studies, and considering the importance of environmental issues in the airline industry, this study aims to develop a Waste Management Index to support airport waste management issues, focusing on a case study of a Brazilian public airport.====To achieve the objective of the study, we developed a fuzzy model whose response or output was a Fuzzy Waste Management Index (FWMI) that analyze airport waste management performance. This tool was applied in the assessment of environmental issues such as sustainability (Santos et al., 2017), environmental conditions (Silvert, 2000), green consumer (Martínez et al., 2020) where the elaboration of index is necessary, as well as the proposal of this study. Using fuzzy logic in environmental issues gives clear results for different attribute indices, dimensions and general indices, more accurate analysis of decision-making information, solving many common problems such as incompatible observations and implicit value judgments, etc.(Martínez et al., 2020; Santos et al., 2017; Silvert, 2000).====This article is structured as follows: section two presents the methodology adopted for this study, with the description and presentation of the developed model.

However, questions regarding regulations, infrastructure requirements, and economic constraints remain to be answered. Therefore, this review aims at giving an overview on different research areas in the emerging topic of UAM. To this end, findings from several fields within the UAM research ==== were gathered and are presented here to provide a landscape of relevant questions surrounding the implementation of UAM. This overview considers vehicle-related aspects, such as aircraft requirements and aircraft classification for intra- and inter-city passenger transport, and discusses potential hurdles to their introduction. The exploration of challenges includes questions on certification and policy, as well as challenges in the area of traffic management and ground infrastructure requirements. Besides that, literature on operational concepts, possible market structures and the interaction with existing transport systems will be reviewed. The discussion of hurdles will conclude with a summary of current literature on public acceptance of UAM. An overview of methods for modelling and simulation of UAM will wrap up the prior discussion and provide insights on first modelling results.","Urban air mobility (UAM) is an emerging topic that is currently gaining a lot of attention from both industry and research. In this overview, we consider inter- and intra-city air passenger transport services, with a special focus on services enabled by novel aircraft types with the capability for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). The operational concept which utilizes these VTOL-enabling aircraft is also often referred to as flying taxis or flying autonomous vehicles. Following Gartner's Hype Cycle (Panetta, 2019) flying autonomous vehicles are still in the so-called innovation trigger phase, but are expected to reach the peak of inflated expectations soon. The plateau of productivity that follows the trough of disillusionment and slope of enlightenment is said to be reached within the next five to ten years.====This article aims at giving an overview on the different relevant fields in UAM research. With UAM being a rather novel and hyped topic, we want to give the reader insights into the entire field and guide her along different lines of argumentation. So far, no exhaustive overview of the several fields within UAM has been provided, and this paper aims at closing this gap. Fig. 1 provides a first overview over the various fields of research.====Understanding the historical development of urban air mobility and its predecessors – especially helicopter services – helps to understand potential developments and required next steps to enable a transformation from helicopter services to UAM. Thus, a brief overview will be given in the following.====The idea of flying vehicles within urban areas started in the 1940s, with the advent of helicopters which provided vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability. Low technology maturation led to several accidents, which - together with high noise levels and high operating costs - forced most of the operators in the US and Europe to cease their operations in late 1960s to mid-1970s. Today, helicopter-based passenger transportation exists as a small niche on a charter basis in various cities, e.g. New York, Sao Paulo, Mexico City or Monaco. Besides passenger transport, UAM covers a broad variety of operational concepts like medical emergency missions, logistics, or surveillance as a non-transport service example. While this paper focusses on passenger transport applications, the operational concepts mentioned above might provide market entry opportunities for manufacturers and service providers to gain higher public acceptance.====Progress in power electronics, communications, sensors and data analytics, combined with large cost reductions due to the availability of high performing commercial of the shelf components, have opened up completely new opportunities especially for small unmanned aerial vehicles (Shamiyeh et al., 2017). Currently, various stakeholders with backgrounds in aeronautics, technology, ground transportation, as well as start-ups financed by equity investments, are active in the field (Shamiyeh et al., 2018). As the development of new mobility technologies is being spurred by the increasing strain of traffic congestion in large cities, it is not surprising that more and more start-ups and established companies from the aviation and automotive industries are active in the field of UAM, with the goal of providing competitive solutions to an emerging market.====Technology is often discussed as one of the main reasons for the hype surrounding UAM. During the last decade, significant technological progress, especially regarding distributed electric propulsion and battery storage (Kuhn et al., 2011; Rezende et al., 2018), have led to a large number of flying vehicle concepts and demonstrators for personal air transport. An overview of research discussing vehicle concepts and aircraft requirements will be covered in chapter two.====It is essential to have appropriate regulation in place to enable safe UAM operation. In this context, this overview focusses on aircraft certification, discussing current approaches pursued by, e.g., EASA, as well as possible policies and market regulation. Especially in view of market regulation aspects, chapter three tries to find analogies to existing urban transport modes in order to, wherever possible, draw from this knowledge.====As most transport systems, UAM also requires infrastructure. This infrastructure does not only encompass physical ground infrastructure for the vehicles itself (vertiports), but requires the means for traffic management based on digital technology and telecommunications. Chapter four thus provides a discussion of ground infrastructure, mainly focusing on vertiport location. Besides that, a brief introduction into the field of UAM traffic management (UTM) will be given, also touching on the need for appropriate digital infrastructure. As UTM is a topic that currently receives a lot of attention, this overview is far from giving a holistic review but rather gives a brief introduction. The interested reader is invited to gain additional information from the broad range of research projects currently founded, e.g. under the umbrella of U-Space (SESAR Joint Undertaking) in Europe.====A broad range of topics related to UAM operation is discussed within chapter five. One section refers to concepts of operation, giving insight into various application cases and target segments identified by research. Besides providing an overview of different market actors, the level of integration over different market levels is discussed and insight into required partnerships is provided. The chapter closes by discussing the need for an efficient integration of UAM into existing transportation systems, based on considerations of sustainability and allocation of resources.====Industry representatives (Yedavalli and Mooberry, 2019) have identified public acceptance and user adoption as main hurdles for successful UAM introduction. Chapter six gives insight into relevant research in this field and draws analogies to other autonomous modes of transport.====The last field of research discussed within this paper is UAM transport modelling and simulation. First attempts have been made to model urban aerial transport in different levels of granularity. Chapter seven introduces the reader into this field and guides her along different publications.====This review closes by highlighting fields not yet sufficiently covered by research and derives key contributions.",An overview of current research and developments in urban air mobility – Setting the scene for UAM introduction,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719304302,15 June 2020,2020,Research Article,361.0

By referring to the network of the largest European LCC, Ryanair, we provide evidence on how its new inter-connecting strategy is influenced by market, supply, and leg characteristics. Applying a ====, results suggest that Ryanair is offering connecting flights on both non-directly offered markets and on markets that it already serves directly. The likelihood to observe a connecting flight increases at higher level of legs' frequency and at lower levels of Ryanair's legs' market share. Eventually, this new connecting strategy is negatively correlated with market distance, routing factor, direct frequency, and Ryanair's current O&D market share.","These days, the difference between low-cost carriers (LCCs) and full-service carriers (FSCs) is not as extreme as in the past. LCCs have begun a ‘hybridization’ process, introducing certain features traditionally associated with FSCs into their business models (e.g., Daft and Albers, 2015; Dobruszkes, 2013; Fageda et al., 2015; Fichert and Klophaus, 2016; Klophaus et al., 2012; Klophaus and Fichert, 2019; Morandi et al., 2015). Evidence shows that several strategies recently adopted by LCCs reduce their differences with respect to traditional carriers. LCCs have begun operating in primary airports, offering flexible fares targeted at business travelers, implementing codesharing agreements, and establishing long-haul operations (de Wit and Zuidberg, 2012; Dobruszkes et al., 2017; Fageda et al., 2015; Fichert and Klophaus, 2016; Morrell, 2008).====One of the key features of LCCs, which has traditionally distinguished them from FSCs, is their network configuration based on a point-to-point system (e.g., Fageda et al., 2015; Klophaus and Fichert, 2019; Suau-Sanchez et al., 2016). However, some European LCCs have recently begun implementing connecting itineraries. To this extent, this study aims to explore this phenomenon and to investigate the market and network characteristics that underpin the choice of connecting markets by LCCs. To pursue our aim, we rely on the connecting choices of the biggest European LCC, Ryanair. By means of a probit regression, we consider the connections implemented by Ryanair over the course of a week in the first semester of 2019 and we analyze the influence of market-, supply-, and leg-specific characteristics on the choice of connecting. Certainly, the introduction of connecting flights has significant effects on the strategies of LCCs, leading to new and interesting research questions, specifically related to the resulting increased complexity in the management of both schedule and pricing.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the state-of-the-art on the introduction of connecting flights into the business models of LCCs.

At some airports, annual growth in PRM (persons with reduced mobility) traffic is six times greater than the overall rate of passenger growth yet barriers to accessible air travel remain and disabled passengers continue to exhibit a lower propensity to fly than other travellers. In an attempt to aid disabled passengers’ accessibility to air travel, countries have introduced dedicated air passenger rights and consumer protection legislation which seeks to specifically address the needs of disabled travellers. These regulations typically state minimum service standards and levels of service provision that must be provided by air transport operators to enable disabled travellers to access air travel on an equal basis to other passengers. These legal interventions, however, have been developed on a country-by-country basis and this has created a lack of international regulatory alignment. This paper reports on the findings of an international survey of disabled air passenger rights legislation in 47 countries covering 20 aviation markets (the single market in the European Union and 19 other States).

There is growing recognition that the physical mobility and travel experiences of airline passengers who have locomotive, sensory and/or communicative needs is circumscribed and constrained not only by the design and built environment of airport terminal buildings and the configuration of aircraft cabins but also by the attitudes of customer-facing staff and the practices and regulatory regimes of global air travel. These physical, behavioural and institutional factors have, both individually and collectively, created a politics of aero-====mobility for a growing section of the global population which either effectively prevents, or severely impacts upon, their ability to access air travel and/or their experiences of it (====, ====; ====; ====). This situation is compounded by a lack of international regulatory alignment in the field of disabled air passenger rights which creates, according to the International Air Transport Association (====), a ‘legal minefield’ for airline and airport operators.

Female, older passengers, high-income passengers, and frequent flyers were more likely to continue flying. The finding confirms that the Trans Java Toll Road affected a decline in air demand on Java Island. However, traveling with family members, rather than airfare hikes, became a more substantial reason for air passengers to switch to driving the toll roads. This research found that air passengers were inelastic related to changes in travel time, while 6% were willing to switch due to airfare increases of 10%.","The government of Indonesia has been prioritizing the rapid development of the country's infrastructure since 2014. To date,==== 3,432 km of national roads, 941 km of toll roads, and eight dams, and counting, have been built, according to the national plan. The prioritized project of the toll roads, to be called Trans Java Toll Road (TJTR), is expected to stretch along Java Island from the West to the East. The toll route could reduce travel time by 37% compared to the existing route.==== It would also be an alternative to other modes, such as train and airplanes. At the same time, the government, through the Ministry of Transportation, has issued new regulations on airfare, namely Transportation Ministerial Regulation No. 20/2019 and Transportation Ministerial Decree No.72/2019, that regulate the price floor and raise the price ceiling up to 35%. As a result, this policy is having significant impacts on the Indonesian airline industry. The number of airline passengers during Indonesia's peak holidays (i.e., Eid al-Fitr, Christmas, and New Year) fell 27.74% in 2019 compared to the previous year (Ministry of Transportation Republic of Indonesia: Directorate General Of Civil Aviation, 2019). Fig. 1 shows the decrease in air passenger demand at the four busiest airports on Java Island, where the cities are currently also facilitated by TJTR.====This study looks at changing passenger attitudes toward domestic travel modes from three different perspectives. First, it aims to explore who among air passengers will be more sensitive to changing modes in response to the presence of TJTR and the airfare increase policy. Second, it investigates air passengers’ psychological perceptions of TJTR by using an extended model of the theory of planned behavior (Beck and Ajzen, 1991). Third, since previous studies have established travel time and airfare as the two main factors influencing airline consumer decision-making (Lee et al., 2019; Moeckel et al., 2015), the study aims to measure the elasticity of those factors. It is expected to not only enrich the literature related to perceptions of human behavior in predicting mode use, especially in Southeast Asia, but to also broaden the current knowledge of how airfare and toll road development affects mode choice behavior. On a practical level, this study can help to guide our government in determining the more appropriate policies in the future. This study also can assist both airline companies and toll road operators in strengthening their business strategies and increasing their competitiveness.====This study focuses on nonbusiness trip purposes-based intercity travel (i.e., tourism and visiting relatives or friends) because air passengers with nonbusiness trip purposes have a higher level of sensitivity to airfare changes (Lu, 2017). A study by Lee et al. (2016) shows a similar finding. It found that business air passengers are more inelastic regarding airfare changes since they had a wider variety of airfare choices and a higher time value than leisure passengers. There is a unique culture for Indonesian people in facing their nonbusiness trip intercity travel. Although car use requires much longer travel times than airplane use, and they do not appear to be comparable, the actual conditions shows that Indonesians prefer driving for nonbusiness trip purpose-based intercity travel due to the lack of public transport service for inner-city trips in their origin and destination cities. Once they use airplanes or intercity trains, they have to use public transport for their first and last mile modes. In Yogyakarta, one of the cities on Java Island, commuter train users from outside the city park their motorcycles at railway stations so they can use them as egress transport from the stations to their final destinations due to the lack of public transport service availability for the last mile mode (Irawan et al., 2017). Likewise, many Indonesians spend a few days visiting their families in other cities on Java Island. These trips usually occur during long national holidays (i.e., Eid al-Fitr, Christmas and New Year). It is at those times that the presence of TJTR becomes a welcome alternative for large families with low-to-middle incomes who would otherwise be unable to keep up with the mounting airfares. Even though travel time becomes longer, the cost is cut, especially for families with many members traveling together at the same time.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The following section briefly discusses current studies about air passenger behavior.

Airport-level data were constructed for non-stop routes from 2010 to 2018. This study examines the effects of changes in scheduling constraints induced by airport night curfews on domestic and international routes through competition intensity. The empirical findings suggest that competition leads to less differentiated flight departure times on domestic routes from the two regional airports. However, competition leads to more differentiated flight departure times on international routes from Daegu airport, which has a new night curfew, while a clustered departure pattern is found for international routes from Cheongju airport. An obvious pattern of differentiated departure times is found after the easing of night curfews in 2014, along with the expansion in LCCs.","The Korean airline industry has undergone significant changes in its market structure since 2005, when the first wave of low-cost carriers (LCCs) was started. Before 2008, the international flights from Korea were operated by two full-service carriers—Korean Air (KAL) and Asiana Airlines (AAR). After the entry of LCCs into the international air transport market in 2008, competition intensified on short/medium-haul routes to Asia, which had long been exclusively serviced by major legacy carriers in Korea.====As of 2019, LCCs serviced over half of the domestic city-pair market and accounted for 45% of short-haul international passenger traffic, according to Korea Airports Corporation (KAC). International passenger traffic has shown rapid growth and this expanding growth has contributed to intensified competition on short-haul routes to China, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries. External constraints and regulations also affect airline competition on domestic and international routes. Frequent flights on busy routes and flight departure times are constrained by airport utilization rate and external airport constraints, such as slot allocation and night curfews, which affect carriers’ strategic scheduling. Carriers cannot operate frequent flights or launch new route services when airport capacity limit is reached. To launch new international routes and more frequent flights, LCCs started departing from less congested regional routes, thereby, expanding their bases.====The two legacy carriers have developed a carrier-within-carrier (CWC) model on both domestic and international routes, in response to the competition from LCCs, which are not owned by full-service carriers. The major carriers’ CWC strategies are associated with product differentiation in terms of departure time, which is important for airport management and air transport policymakers. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate how optimization of domestic/international route structure and flight departures differ according to airport capacity restrictions.====This study investigates the impact of competition intensity on flight departure scheduling strategies at regional airports. Using an instrumental variable (IV) approach, we construct an airline scheduling model, controlling for airport-specific constraints. We find that there is a negative relationship between departure time differentiation and competition intensity on domestic routes. The estimated impact of competition intensity on airlines’ scheduling pattern differs for the two regional airports for international routes. This empirical finding implies the presence of strategic allocation of differentiated flight schedules in two segments: domestic and international. We examine the effect of easing night curfews on airline flight departure scheduling and find evidence of more differentiated schedules.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In addition, how ticket price changes the behaviors of those factors in that model is also examined. A survey of 781 passengers was conducted in two major airports in Thailand to test the hypotheses. The results indicate the important role of passengers' attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control in LCC passenger's buying behavior. More importantly, the presence of the ticket price does change how other factors predict the behavioral intention and actual use of LCCs in Southeast Asia.","Evidence shows that Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) have achieved tremendous success across the world and become an important driver to the growth of air transportation and economy (Choo and Oum, 2013). Southeast Asia is a growing market that fully embraces the LCC concept (Hanaoka et al., 2014). Countries in this region contain large numbers of islands, which makes air travel essential for transportation. Additionally, passengers in this region are price sensitive and would prefer simple, low-fare service provided by LCCs (Bowen, 2016). Finally, the aviation policies, especially the creation of ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM), greatly promote the proliferationof LCCs in Southeast Asia (Wang et al., 2017). LCCs have achieved a strong presence in Southeast Asia, accounting for nearly half of the market in the region (Bowen, 2016). This number is significantly higher than in the U.S. and Europe, the two major LCC markets in the world (Klophaus et al., 2012; Kwoka et al., 2016).====Southeast Asia has a remarkably high LCC presence, with half of its total seats sold by LCCs, i.e., travelers in this region would frequently encounter the decision-making of selecting LCCs as a transport mode (Bowen, 2016). The growing number of LCCs in this market increases the competition among airlines, which leads to a question: How do passengers in this region choose to select an LCC for travel? Passengers in this region have different characteristics and attitudes compared to passengers in Western countries, indicating different buying behaviors. Understanding their buying attitudes and behaviors is a key success factor for airlines in this growing region. LCC studies in Southeast Asia focused mainly on the impacts of the ticket price and other factors, such as safety consideration, airline image, in-flight services, booking convenience, and schedule (Buaphiban and Truong, 2017). However, they found contradicting findings regarding the impacts of these factors. While the ticket price is consistently the most dominant impact factor, existing studies found that the impacts of service quality, safety, and airline image changed from one study to another (Chang and Hung, 2013; Davison and Ryley, 2010). Additionally, these studies mainly examined the direct impacts of these external factors on the LCC selection but not the differences in passengers' behaviors and attitudes toward LCCs in this region. The lack of focus on attitude and behavioral factors is the major gap in the LCC literature, which requires further understanding of the passengers’ buying behaviors to help the carriers expand their market share (Buaphiban and Truong, 2017).====Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is a popular theory for understanding buyers' attitudes and behaviors in the purchasing process. It has been applied widely in many areas, including the transportation domain, but rarely in the LCC context, in general, and in the LCC in Southeast Asia, in particular. Buaphiban and Truong (2017) used the traditional TPB model to examine the effect of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in Southeast Asian passengers' intentions and behaviors. However, this study only examined passengers' internal behavioral factors, including attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control. External stimuli and their interaction with the TPB factors have not been studied. Given the distinctive demographics of passengers in Southeast Asia, internal behaviors are not sufficient to explain how they decide to choose airlines for travel. Research shows that extended TBP models, incorporating external stimuli, provide more useful information about the buying behavior and increases the predictive power for the selection decision (Chen and Tung, 2014; Donal et al., 2014; Hsieh, 2015). As such, an extended TBP model for LCCs in Southeast Asia is much needed to provide a holistic understanding of the factors underlying passengers’ buying decisions in this important LCC market.====Additionally, existing literature of LCC passengers in Southeast Asia, especially in Malaysia and Thailand, stressed the predominant impact of airfares on the decision to use LCCs (Sai et al., 2012; Chan, 2014; Chantruthai et al., 2014). While the low-price effect reasonably reflects the behaviors of low-income populations in these countries, the overemphasis on airfares could weaken or distort the importance of other underlying factors for selecting LCCs. Research shows that simply competing by lowering the price does not guarantee sustainable success (O'Connell and Williams, 2005); hence, further exploration of the impacts of other factors is critical. It is still unknown how internal behavioral and extended factors would behave differently in a prediction of passengers' choice of LCCs with or without the presence of the ticket price. This comparison has not been made in the LCC literature, which only examined the direct effect of the ticket price as a dominating factor independently from other factors. In order to have a clear understanding of these scenarios, it is vital to examine and compare the effects of behavioral and external factors and their inter-correlations with TPB factors when the ticket price is presented and when it is absent in the extended TPB model. To the best of our knowledge, no study has performed a comparative analysis based on the presence of the ticket price in the LCC literature.====In order to fill these gaps in the LCC literature, this study proposed and tested an extended TPB model engaging both internal behaviors and external stimuli in order to gain a better understanding of the LCC selection in Southeast Asia. Additionally, to compare the effects of these factors on the passengers' buying behavior, two extended TPB models, with and without the presence of the ticket price as a predicting factor, were tested and compared. The results of this paper promise both theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, the extended TPB model for LCCs in Southeast Asia adds a rich understanding of how passengers in this region select LCCs for air travel, from both internal behavioral and external stimuli perspectives. The comparison of two extended TPB models shows how these factors behave differently in predicting the passengers’ buying behavior with and without the presence of the ticket price. Given the different behaviors and demographics of Southeast Asian travelers, these findings add significant contributions to the current LCC literature. Practically, the findings of this study provide airlines with a clear picture of how Southeast Asian travelers behave and select LCCs for air travel, based on which they can have appropriate marketing and operational strategies to attract more passengers in this competitive market.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the existing literature in passenger choice in LCCs in Southeast Asia, the ground theory, and the research model, along with the proposed hypotheses. Then, the research methodology and data collection process are described, followed by detailed results of the measurement model, the full structural model, and results of the hypothesis testing.

This study aims to answer the following research questions: i). Whether the LCC passengers have higher purchasing power than FSC (full-service carrier) passengers for the airport concessions, particularly the duty-free goods? ii). Would the budget terminal design contribute to or jeopardize the LCC passengers' airport concession expenditure? iii). How could the airport operator maximize its concession revenue by re-designing terminal or re-allocating flight slots? We collect the actual airport duty-free transaction data from Incheon International Airport (ICN) for an empirical investigation. Our empirical evidence first suggests that LCC passengers could have comparable or even higher purchasing power than FSC passengers in consuming duty-free goods at the airport. Among all the LCC passengers, Chinese have the highest purchasing power. Second, the inferior shopping environment and service quality of budget terminal seriously jeopardize the duty-free sales from the LCC passengers. Third, counterfactual analyses show that, if ICN could convert its budget terminal into a conventional terminal, 44 million USD more duty-free sales can be generated per year. Even keeping the current terminal design, re-allocating the LCC flights between the budget terminal and conventional terminal could bring approximately 4.9 million USD more duty-free sales per year. The findings provide managerial implications to ICN and other airports for effective airport ====. First, the budget terminal design may not be ideal to accommodate LCC traffic as it damages the concession revenue from particular LCC passengers with high purchasing power. Second, exploring the concession revenue from the growing LCC traffic could help maintain an airport's advantage in aeronautical charge under single-till regulation.","The low-cost carrier (LCC) business model has been well developed around the world. To attract the LCCs to operate at their airports, many European airports constructed the budget terminals (i.e., the LCC dedicated terminals), providing LCCs with lower airport service charge and favorable slots (Barrett, 2004; Hanaoka and Saraswati, 2011). To save on the construction and operational costs in exchange for the lower service charge to the LCCs, the airport operators would equip the budget terminals with inferior commercial facilities, leading to fewer duty-free stores and poorer shopping environment for the LCC passengers. This is also consistent with the airport operators' belief that the LCC passengers are not willing to spend more concessions including the duty-free goods (thereafter “duty-frees” for short) than the full-service carrier (FSC) passengers. In addition, the budget terminals could be located far away from the airport security checks and the central shopping areas, as the LCCs normally do not need air bridges or escalators in order to speed up the flight turnover and save on operational cost (e.g., Echevarne, 2008; McLay and Reynolds-Feighan, 2006). But such inferior shopping environment may negatively affect the LCC passengers’ airport concession consumption as well.====With this budget terminal business model emerging from Europe and the US (Njoya and Niemeier, 2011), some major Asian airports also attempted to adopt such strategy to accommodate their fast growing LCC operations (Price and Hermans, 2009). For example, Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) once built a budget terminal for the Tiger Airways. Incheon International Airport (ICN) is now using the Concourse A built by extending its Terminal 1 (T1) as the budget terminal to accommodate its growing LCC traffic. In recent years, Kansai International Airport (KIX) and Naha International Airport (OKA) in Japan also launched the budget terminals for their LCC traffic. However, unlike European and North American counterparts, budget terminals in Asia appear not to be well operated. For example, SIN demolished its budget terminal in 2017 and converted it into a hybrid one to be used by both FSCs and LCCs with better service quality. The is because SIN has realized its LCC passengers actually significantly contribute to the airport's concession revenue. The inferior shopping condition in the budget terminal could significantly discourage passengers' purchasing desire, thus lowering the overall airport revenue. Airports in Northeast Asia (NEA) including Japan and South Korea seem to face a similar market condition. In particular, the increasing Chinese LCC passengers to Korea and Japan are likely to have very strong purchasing power, as they are willing to spend more on the airport concessions (Liu and Oum, 2018). This challenges the typical budget terminal concept which focuses on the cost saving but neglects the commercial services to the LCC passengers.====Therefore, a better understanding of LCC passengers' purchasing power could be important for the airport to evaluate the viability of the budget terminal. This is especially essential in Asian market, which is now becoming the world's largest LCC market with more than 600 million scheduled seats per year.==== When the LCC passengers have considerable purchasing power, it might not be optimal for the airport to save on costs, while compromising LCC passengers' concession spending. Airports should balance their revenues from both aeronautical and concession sides (Halpern and Graham, 2013). An improvement in the commercial facilities, shopping environment, slot allocation, and terminal design could be worthy for the airport to increase its concession revenues from the LCC traffic. To the best of our knowledge, the existing studies have only examined the LCC traffic's overall impact on the airport concession revenue, whereas no study is done to examine the LCC passengers' purchasing power (demand side) and the impact of terminal types (i.e., conventional vs. budget terminal).====Our study thus aims to answer the following research questions: i). Whether the LCC passengers have higher purchasing power than FSC passengers for the airport concessions, particularly the duty-frees? ii). Would the budget terminal concept contribute to or jeopardize the LCC passengers’ airport concession expenditure? iii). How could the airport operator maximize its concession revenue by re-designing terminal or re-allocating flight slots?====We collect data from Incheon International Airport (ICN) for an empirical investigation. ICN is one representative gateway and transfer hub in NEA. More than 90% of ICN's passengers originate from Asia, especially from its neighboring countries, such as China and Japan. The concession revenue makes up more than half of the total airport revenue. In recent years, the LCC traffic has been growing very fast at ICN. ICN thus built and is utilizing its Concourse A as a budget terminal. The LCC operations are thus accommodated in both the conventional terminal (i.e., Terminal 1) and the budget terminal (i.e., Concourse A). This provides us with an ideal context to study the impacts of both the purchasing power of the LCC passengers and the terminal types on the airport's concession revenue. According to ATRS (2018), the duty-free business is the major component of an airport's concession operations, accounting for more than half of the airport total concession revenue. This study, thus, focuses on the duty-free sales to explore passengers' expenditure on airport concession.====Our empirical study on ICN obtains following major findings. First, for the duty-free-purchasing passengers, the LCC passengers have comparable or even higher purchasing power than the FSC passengers. Among all the LCC passengers, the Chinese have the highest purchasing power. This is in line with our anticipation that Chinese travelers are willing to purchase more duty-frees when traveling to overseas airports. Second, the inferior shopping environment and the inconvenience brought by the budget terminal design seriously jeopardize the duty-free sales from the LCC passengers. Again, the Chinese LCC passengers and flights are most adversely affected. Thus, given the significant duty-free purchasing power of the LCC passengers and the serious negative impact of the budget terminal design, ICN is suggested to improve its terminal design in order to stimulate the duty-free sales from its LCC passengers. Third, the counterfactual analyses are conducted. We show that if the budget terminal could be converted into a similar layout as T1, the ICN would have 44 million USD more duty-free sales per year. Even without any changes in the current terminal layout, exchanging some LCC flights between T1 and Concourse A would bring about 4.9 million USD more duty-free sales per year. Overall, we conclude that the designated budget terminals which provide inferior commercial services could be very detrimental to an airport's concession revenue. Asian airports should be very cautious to adopt the budget terminal concept when accommodating the fast growing LCC traffic with considerable duty-free purchasing power.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use the actual airport duty-free transaction data to explore passengers' concession expenditure, while all previous studies rely on the airport survey data. Our individual-level data from the actual duty-free transactions helps to overcome the potential sample selection bias that might prevail in the survey data. In addition, our duty-free transaction data also contain the flight information (e.g., departing terminal, gate, scheduled and actual departing time) of the passenger who made the transaction. This also enables us to examine more factors on passengers’ airport concession consumption, and would also correct potential omitted variable bias.====The rest of our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and identifies the research gaps for us to fill in. Next, we discuss the study setting, data, and the empirical methods in Section 3.

The results show that the most significant dimension is digital trust, and the three most important criteria are proactive customer service, cybersecurity, and customer insight.","Over the past three decades, the airline industry has witnessed a number of changes such as low-cost carriers and increasing market share. On the other hand, the next thirty years will be more turbulent with the emergence of a wave of technological change, transformation and innovation (IATA, 2018). Air transportation and the airline industry have been witnessing the effects of digital transformation (DT) for the past few years. Nowadays, the connection between airlines and their customers is threatened by three global trends that are reshaping travel distribution business models. These are; changing customer behavior, dynamics within direct and indirect sales and emerging digital technologies (Borgogna et al., 2016). DT and these global trends have brought widespread use of digital channels and platforms, the use of multiple devices, growing social media popularity and differentiation of travel decision-making processes. DT has changed the behavior of customers who are now more engaged with airlines (Borgogna et al., 2016) via digital platforms and loyalty programs. Customers have become digital customers. The digital demands and expectations of digital customers are now in question (CGI, 2015).====Airlines should focus on increasing the understanding of how consumer behavior is changing. One way to understand this is by measuring SQ. However, there is a radical customer service transformation driven by customers (Hoong, 2013). Customers are now constantly online and mobile. They have accessibility to digital channels, and they can access the services they want to receive. This leads us to see the reality that classical SQ perception is changing. The products and services offered by airline companies have been replaced by digital products and services. Hence, DSQ (Tate et al., 2014) should be focused and measured and a new model for its measurement is needed.====There are electronic and web-based (Parasuraman et al., 2005) and mobile service quality (Lu et al., 2009) models based on SERVQUAL (Parasuraman et al., 1985) in the literature even though no DSQ model exists. Hence, a new and original DSQ model based on SERVQUAL is presented in this study. The proposed model is constructed based on the results of the literature survey and the opinions of decision makers (DMs) who are experts in air transportation and the airline industry. A case study is conducted to validate the proposed model in the Turkish airline industry. The AHP method which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) is utilized for the validation.====Measuring DSQ involves decision-making processes. The decisions taken for real-life problems in business contain more than one criterion at the same time (Büyüközkan et al., 2018). Up to now, different MCDM techniques such as AHP (Saaty, 1980), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) (Hwang and Yoon, 1981), VIseKriterijumsa Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) (Opricovic, 1998), have been proposed in order to perform decision making and to manage decision making processes. These analytical techniques have been successfully applied to many different decision-making problems (Toloie-Eshlaghy and Homayonfar, 2011; Dožić, 2019; Fu, 2019). The AHP method is utilized in the study due to its capability of applicability, usability, easiness, repeatability and consistency check.====Although they traditionally utilize crisp numbers which are inadequate to deal with real-life problems, many of these techniques can be extended to the fuzzy environment (Kahraman et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; Dožić, 2019; Havle and Kılıç, 2019). However, even in cases where the data are not complete, including inaccuracy and vagueness, even normal fuzzy sets can be insufficient. Hence, IVIF sets are used in the study combined with the AHP method. The Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IF) or IVIF sets are developed to deal with such cases and they are used for different decision-making problems in the literature (Abdullah and Najib, 2016; Şenel et al., 2018; Büyüközkan et al., 2020a, Büyüközkan et al., 2020b). The differentiation of positive and negative indication in terms of interval membership and non-membership of an element in a set is the uppermost advantage of IVIF sets, therefore; IVIF numbers are much more sufficient to model and solve complex problems. (Büyüközkan et al., 2018).====The proposed new DSQ model and its evaluation criteria are constructed through a literature survey and experts’ opinions. A hierarchical model is constructed with the assumption of independence between criteria. DMs who are experts performed pairwise comparison to evaluate the criteria in terms of their priorities. Criteria weights are calculated using the IVIF AHP method. Importance degrees of the criteria are revealed. The steps of the study are indicated in Fig. 1 to highlight the general perspective of the study. The originality of the paper results from the following properties:====The paper consists of the following sections: Section 2 provides a literature review. THE proposed DSQ model is detailed in Section 3. Section 4 explains the IVIF sets briefly and the computational steps of the IVIF AHP method are given in this section.

Currently, all aviation passengers travelling to the US on an American carrier from non-U.S. locations undergo screening interview based on detection of suspicious signs, an approach which is not supported by psychological research. An alternative, Controlled Cognitive Engagement (CCE) was shown in a series of field trials to be more effective than suspicious signs methods in detecting deception during security interviews. However, CCE asks passengers to satisfy agents that answers to questions are veridical, which raises a concern that CCE might be viewed as too intrusive. Here, 120 genuine air passengers provided anonymous feedback regarding their experience of screening. CCE-screened passengers reported their experience as significantly more enjoyable, no less intrusive nor less acceptable than the current procedure, and were ‘promoters’ of the technique whereas those in the suspicious signs condition were ‘detractors’. Winning and maintaining the respect and approval of the travelling public is an important consideration in the task of securing freedom of movement and public safety.","Aviation security measures rely on public acceptance of the trade-off between civil liberties and public protection. Passengers travelling by air are familiar with the multiple layers of security at national and international airports. Identifying threats to security of aviation presents significant and evolving challenges. In this context, it is important to establish that security measures have the support of the travelling public.====The U.S. Transport Security Administration (TSA) was established in 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City and is responsible for day-to-day security operations for passenger air transportation (Aviation & Transport Security Act, 2001). Currently, the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program (AOSSP) requires aircraft operators to ‘==== (p.1.1, AOSSP, 2014). Chapter 11 of AOSSP requires ==== passengers travelling to the United States on an American carrier departing from non-U.S. locations be subject to a screening interview while in possession of all accessible property and checked baggage. The TSA mandatory screening interview, which occurs pre-check-in or at the time of check-in, comprises several elements including a documentation check, a series of baggage control questions, and observations of passengers' behaviour.====Billions of dollars have been invested in aviation security procedures (United States Government Accountability Office, 2011), the US Transportation Security Administration budget alone for 2020 being $7.78billion, but the cost and effectiveness of these procedures is often questioned (Gillen and Morrison, 2015; Stewart and Mueller, 2017; Weinberger, 2010), particularly when events suggest they may be less than effective, and where procedures have not been empirically validated (United States Government Accountability Office, 2015, 2017). Many aviation security procedures rely on identifying behavioral indicators (e.g., British Security Industry Association, 2008; Reddick, 2004), referred to as ‘suspicious signs’. The AOSSP Chapter 11 screening interview is one such example, where passengers are asked a series of questions that are the same for every passenger, during which screeners look for suspicious indicators. These indicators concern non-verbal behaviours (e.g., agitation and sweating) and appearance (e.g., being appropriately dressed) which are believed to be indicators of threat and deceit.====We and others have previously highlighted a lack of theoretical or empirical support for this type of screening interview (e.g., Bond and DePaulo, 2006; Ormerod and Dando, 2015). In response, we developed Controlled Cognitive Engagement (CCE) as an alternative interview screening method. CCE embodies six theoretically supported and empirically validated features that can discriminate deceivers from truth tellers, a deceptive passenger being viewed as a security threat. Working alongside U.K. and U.S. government organizations, we carried out a series of randomized-control, double-blind field trials of these two aviation security-screening methods across a number of international airports. Both mock and real passengers passed through a security interview for long-haul flights into the US travelling with two large US carriers. Over an 8-month period, 204 passengers were incentivized to attempt to pass through security undetected while giving untruthful answers to security questions. Over the duration of the field trial the base rate of mock passengers to genuine passengers was 1:1000. Security agents trained to use CCE detected 66% of deceptive passengers compared with less than 5% using the mandated behavioral indicator recognition method.",Aviation security by consent using the Controlled Cognitive Engagement (CCE) alternative screening programme,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719304089,8 May 2020,2020,Research Article,370.0

Our results show that U.S. airports' aeronautical charges are spatially dependent, and neighboring airport charges are positively correlated, implying that U.S. airports are in price competition with each other even though they are government-owned infrastructure. Additionally, we find evidence of airport cost recovery through non-aeronautical revenues. This may be indicative of the airport's cross-subsidizing aeronautical operations with non-aeronautical revenues. In addition, we found the airports that share revenues with airlines charge lower aeronautical fees than those that do not share revenues. We also found that more congested airports charge higher aeronautical fees.","U.S. airports as public entities are tasked with maximizing social welfare while breaking even financially. Thus aeronautical pricing decision is crucial for airport management. Moreover, since aeronautical and non-aeronautical operations are interdependent, and airports provide services to both airlines and passengers, they are essentially a two-sided market platform==== through which the passenger demand for airports is a derived demand from airline services (Ivaldi et al., 2015). Accordingly, as the airport's non-aeronautical revenue depends on passengers' flow in airports, there is a positive externality between air travel demand and the demand for airport non-aeronautical services (D'Alfonso and Nastasi, 2014). Zhang and Czerny (2012) briefly explained this relationship: an increase in aeronautical charges could cause a decrease in passenger flow which is the main source of non-aeronautical revenues for the airport. Starkie (2002) emphasized that motivated airport management maximizes its profit by focusing on increasing passenger throughput. To achieve this goal, airports must spark airlines' enthusiasm to bring in more passengers. Thus, the aeronautical charges that airlines pay could have implications on both aeronautical and non-aeronautical operations. Empirically, past studies==== have examined airport pricing and the effect of airport competition on aeronautical charges using a control variable such as the number of airports within a prespecified cluster or distance. However, the implicit assumptions are that, regardless of the distance between them, airports are independent of each other even for airports in the same region, and any competition effect on airport charges is the same. But there is no reason to assume that the strategies, operations, and characteristics of neighboring airports are independent of each other especially when their catchment areas are close and likely to be overlapped. In this study, we explicitly account for the potential spatial interdependence of aeronautical charges while examining the determinants of airport pricing decisions. Specifically, we employ a spatial lag model with spatial autoregressive disturbance model using U.S. hub airport data from years 2009 through 2016. To our knowledge, this is the first study that accounts for the spatial interdependence of airport's aeronautical pricing decisions.====The paper is organized as follows.

The purpose of this research is to develop and test predictive models for sUAS violation incidents in NAS using machine learning. This research uses machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of sUAS violation incidents using the FAA's UAS sighting data with a sample size of 2088. Three sUAS violation types are identified: flying above 400 feet, flying with 5 miles from an airport, and flying in restricted airspace. Seven machine learning algorithms were used, including classification regression, decision tree, ====, gradient boosting, random forest, Bayesian networks, and Memory-Based Reasoning. The results show that Gradient boosting produces the best predictive model. This model can predict the sUAS violation incidents with an accuracy of 95.7 percent. Location, distance to the airport, state, sUAs altitude, airport type, and aircraft type are the most influential predictors to the sUAS violation incidents.","Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) is an emerging sector of the aerospace industry, and the sUAS market was projected to reach $52.30 billion in 2025 (Business Insider, 2018). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines sUAS as “a small unmanned aircraft, weighing less than 55 pounds, and equipment necessary for the safe and efficient operation of that aircraft” (FAA, 2016, p. 42065). sUAS can be used either for recreational or business purposes. The demand for sUAS has grown rapidly. In June 2016, the FAA issued the new Small UAS Rule (part 107), which requires sUAS to be registered and sUAS pilots to have the remote pilot airman certificate and pass the FAA-approved test if the sUAS is used for business or work. If used for recreational purposes, the sUAS over 0.55lbs must be registered, but the operator does not need any permission from the FAA to fly (FAA, 2016). These rules must be followed even by international UAS operators in the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, the FAA announced that more than 110,000 commercial operators registered to use sUAS, and with over 873,000 modelers registered, the FAA projected that there are around 1.1 million sUAS identified distinctly as model aircraft (FAA, 2018). As of April 2, 2018, based on the FAA FOIA Library, there are 1,064,389 sUAS registered to the FAA database, in which 904,435 for recreational and 159,954 for commercial use.====At the global level, the sUAS market was valued at $9.71 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach $40.31 billion by 2025, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.04% during the forecast period. Major regions of the sUAS market include North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. North America is estimated to be the largest market for sUAS in 2018 (Markets and Markets, 2019). The increasing use of sUAS for border and maritime surveillance activities in countries, such as the U.S. and Canada, is driving the growth of the market in North America. By 2023, the U.S. is expected to dominate the America UAS market. America region is followed by Asia-Pacific and dominated by Japan and China, which is the largest manufacturer of consumer sUAS. The total market revenue in this country was valued at $2 billion in 2017, and it is expected to reach $4.5 billion by 2023 at a CAGR estimation of 24.5% in the forecast period (Markets and Markets, 2019).====UAS have the potential to create hazards to aviation safety, and the primary safety concern is the ability of a UAS operator to observe manned aircraft in time to prevent a mid-air collision between the UAS and another aircraft (DeGarmo, 2004). Therefore, regulatory safeguards were incorporated into the FAA's final small UAS regulations (part 107), which explicitly requires sUAS to stay under 400 feet above ground level (ABL), at a speed of no faster than 100 mph, away from airports, and operate during daylight hours. When an sUAS is flown within 5 miles of an airport, the operator must provide the airport and air traffic control tower with prior notice (FAA, 2016).====The safety of integrating UAS into NAS is one of the FAA's top priorities (FAA, 2016). Despite strict procedures and regulations issued by the FAA, not all UAS operators adhere to these rules. There have been many incidents in which manned aircraft pilots and air traffic controllers reported their encounters with sUAS in the restricted airspace. Specifically, the UAS sighting report shows that there have been 4711 UAS encounter incidents reported for 34 months from November 2014 to September 2017 (FAA, 2019). This high number of sightings of sUAS violating the FAA-defined regulations raises questions about the reliable separation of sUAS and manned aircraft needed to ensure safety in the NAS (Gettinger and Michel, 2015). FAA regulations require pilots of manned flights to see and avoid other aircraft in order to maintain separation, but research suggests that this doctrine is not a reliable method for avoiding collisions between UAS and manned aircraft (Woo et al., 2020). When an sUAS operates above 400 feet AGL, intentionally or unintentionally, it increases the risk of collision between the sUAS and manned aircraft. Similarly, the collision may occur when an sUAS operates near airports, in which manned aircraft fly at low altitudes while on the final approach and during take-off (Gettinger and Michel, 2015). While this risk can be mitigated by methods such as see-and-avoid, in most circumstances flying sUAS below 400 feet AGL or flying more than 5 miles away from an airport will provide necessary separation and consequently avoid the risk of collision (Logan et al., 2011).====As the number of sUAS continues to grow, the number of sightings of violating sUAS will likely rise; on average, the FAA receives more than 200 incident reports per month (FAA, 2017). The higher the number of sUAS encounter incidents, the higher the risk of collision in NAS. While the use of sUAS for non-recreational purposes can be controlled at some extent, it is much harder to enforce the rules to individuals using sUAS for fun since they are not required to go through any safety training, to pass any test, or to get the permission from the FAA to fly. Current literature in UAS seems to focus mainly on see-and-avoid methods by pilots, sense-and-avoid technologies, or risk assessment for regulation development purposes (Loffi et al., 2016; Awad, 2013’ Sahawneh, 2016; Zhang et al., 2018; Griner, 2014; Musavi et al., 2017; Murray and Anderson, 2017). While these efforts have contributions to the body of knowledge, they are more reactive than predictive in detecting and mitigating the risk. Reactive research investigates already-happened accidents or incidents to find the causes, whereas predictive research attempts to detect incidents before they happen so the incidents can be mitigated or prevented. These lead to two unanswered questions: How do we accurately predict these violation incidents in NAS? What predictors contribute to the prediction of these incidents?====The purpose of this research is to develop and validate predictive models using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of sUAS violation incidents in NAS. First, data were collected from the FAA's UAS sighting database from October 2016 to September 2017. Then, event narratives were coded into specific variables using two coders with expertise and experience in sUAS and aviation safety, followed by the reliability and validity assessment to ensure the quality of the data. Three sUAS violation types are identified: flying above 400 feet, flying with 5 miles from an airport, and flying in restricted airspace. Seven machine learning algorithms were used, including classification regression, decision tree, neural network, gradient boosting, random forest, Bayesian networks, and Memory-Based Reasoning. The models were compared and evaluated to determine the best predictive model with high prediction accuracy and high predictive power.====This research promises contributions to the sUAS area. The results of this research provide the FAA and stakeholders with a clear picture of safety concerns when more users purchase and fly sUAS for the hobby. This research fills the gap in the UAS literature with the production of a valid and accurate predictive model of sUAS violation incidents. The results provide regulators and aviation authorities with a means to predict the risk of sUAS violation in NAS and allow them to understand the factors that contribute to sUAS violation incidents. Based on these results, necessary mitigation strategies and procedures could be developed to predict and mitigate further violations of existing sUAS rules and regulations.",Using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of small Unmanned Aircraft System violations in the National Airspace System,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719305575,25 April 2020,2020,Research Article,372.0

In contrast with most previous publications, this paper investigates these determinants in an emerging country, Turkey, at the provincial level between 2004 and 2014. We find that GDP/capita, population, distance to alternative airports, tourism, leading cities, and international migrations all support more air traffic. Furthermore, market concentration is associated with less traffic, and the presence of academics with more traffic. Mapping models' residuals suggest ====, surface transport options, domestic migrations and (geo)politics could also matter. Accordingly, it appears the determinants of Turkey's air passenger traffic do not differ from those of developed economies. The results also suggest new airports should be built based on the aforementioned factors.","Trying to determine what drives air passenger traffic is not a new area of study. However, previous efforts have been mostly restricted to developed economies, including the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, and Australia (Wang and Song, 2010). Emerging economies have received less attention, though some authors have considered countries such as Brazil (Marazzo et al., 2010; Fernandes and Pacheco, 2010), China (Wang et al., 2019) or the so-called Middle Income Countries (Valdes, 2015). Recently, the growth in air traffic has taken place mostly in emerging countries (including oil-rich countries seeking to diversify their economies) while traffic has more or less stagnated in traditional leading markets (Boeing, 2019).====In this regard, Turkey is a typical fast-growing air market and by various metrics, Turkish Airlines has become a leading airline. Turkey has implemented both economic development policies and regulatory changes with the explicit goal of boosting its aviation market. In 2003, the Turkish government canceled two specific taxes, a transaction tax and a special education tax, which had been levied on airfares, effective January 1, 2004, hoping to stimulate the air transport industry, which had been significantly hurt by the economic crisis of 2001. The Minister of Transportation claimed that removing these taxes would reduce the price of a ticket worth 100 million Turkish Liras by 20% (Milliyet, 2003). The elimination of these taxes also removed an indirect barrier that had been keeping other airlines from entering the domestic air transport market. FLY Airlines was the first private airline to enter the domestic air market, with flights between Istanbul and Trabzon beginning in October 2003. This shift also meant the end Turkish Airline's de-facto monopoly, which had been in place for years.====Increased competition and reduced fares led to a huge expansion of the Turkish air transport market. Between 2003 and 2017, the total fleet capacity of the Turkish air carriers increased from 27,599 to 97,500 seats, the number of airports more than doubled from 26 to 55, the net revenue of the air transport market ballooned from 3.06 billion Turkish Liras (TRY) to 91.63 billion TRY, the number of airlines serving scheduled domestic routes has increased from 1 to 6, and the number of air passengers increased from 34.4 million to 193.3 million (SHGM, 2018). In addition, in terms of country-pairs, as of 2017, Turkey is the fourth most connected country, with direct regular flights to no fewer than 107 other countries, only below France (118), the UK (108), and the US (108), but more than Germany (104) and the United Arab Emirates (103).==== In addition, Turkish Airlines now leads all other carriers worldwide, in terms of the number of countries flown to. To respond to such rapid growth, Turkish State Airports has launched new Build-Operate-Transfer airport projects that have almost doubled the passenger capacity across the country.====Such a dramatic growth deserves an in-depth examination of the determinants of the Turkish air transport market. Our work intends to widen the spatial range of markets studied by scholars and to help our field better understand what affects air traffic in emerging markets. We aim to analyze the determinants of the total (domestic and international) air passenger traffic in the provinces of Turkey, which is positioning itself as the primary air gateway between Europe and Asia.

However, the percentage of female pilots is still very low. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data, only 7.3% of all US FAA pilot certificates are held by women. The percentage of female pilots among total airline pilots is 4.4% in the USA and 5.2% in the UK (FAA, 2019; CAA, 2019). The situation in Turkey is not different. There are 5 airline companies and female pilots represent only 3.9% of all airline pilots in the country.

The costs considered in this study are hub-related and incurred by passengers and aircraft (i.e., passenger transfer, flight dwelling, and gate occupancy). The objective is to minimize the total cost by optimizing flight sequence (i.e., arrivals and departures) and gate assignment, while considering transfer speed, transfer demand, flight size, gate size and terminal configuration. A real-world HSN whose hub airport (HA) is located at Xianyang International Airport (XIY) in Xi'an, China is analyzed. The optimized solutions and their relations to various model parameters are explored.","As a major inter-city transportation mode, air transportation is popular and commonly preferred by passengers, especially when distances between the origin and destination cities are large. The determination of service frequency and aircraft size is related to passenger demand. Low demand routes are typically served with less frequent service.====Hub and spoke network (HSN) consists of hub airports (HA) and a set of spoke city airports (SCAs). The HSN concept has benefited passengers and airline companies by reducing the cost of operation while providing more frequent service with larger aircraft on high-density routes (Bazargan, 2016; Mohri et al., 2018), although the associated transfer time may be substantial.====Coordination among arrival and departure flights (i.e., flight sequencing and gate assignment) is desirable to mitigate the total cost. To reduce transfer time and cost, flights should be sequenced optimally to arrive at and depart from an HA, subject to given time window. Transfers with longer wait times could be successfully made even if flights arrive and depart more continuously. Batch arrivals and departures of flights are desirable for minimizing transfer delays but are stretched over time by the available runway capacity, static apron capacity or maximum connecting time (Mirkovic and Tosic, 2017), which limit the aircraft arrival and departure rates.====Since connecting flights may vary in size and passenger loads, jointly optimizing flight sequencing and gate assignment may significantly reduce transfer delay and the associated cost. For example, larger aircraft tend to have higher operation costs and passenger loads. Therefore, reducing dwell times, especially for larger flights, may significantly reduce the transfer cost.====Gate assignment is critical to the effectiveness of an HSN. First, available gates should be sufficient for batches of flights. Second, an assigned gate should accommodate the size of the aircraft to be served. Transfer time is affected by the transfer distance between gates and transfer speed, which is stochastic and sometimes significantly deviates from its mean. This situation could be troublesome, especially as the distance increases. Installation of moving walkways may be considered. Third, reducing the transfer distance and/or transfer time may significantly reduce the transfer cost and gate occupancy cost. Instead, improper assignment of gates may result in increasing passenger delay, flight dwell time, connecting time, inefficient use of resources, and customer dissatisfaction. The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for optimizing flight sequencing and gate assignment, separately or jointly, for a set of arrival/departure flights that minimizes the total cost, consisting of passenger transfer cost, flight dwelling cost, and gate occupancy cost.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Improvement in infrastructure services is critical to economic development. The civil aviation sector is vital in propelling economic growth (Baker et al., 2015; Dunbar, 1990; Fung et al., 2006; Weisbrod, 1990). It also contributes significantly to job growth, social welfare, and is thus vital to public policy (Caves, 2003).====The United States is one of the world's largest domestic civil aviation market, worth US$179 billion (Euromonitor, 2018), with the top four airlines- American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines accounting for 17.6%, 17.4%, 17.0%, and 14.9% of total domestic revenue passenger miles (US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2020). A billion passengers traveled by air in the US in 2019 (Nov 2018–Oct 2019), of which around 80% used domestic scheduled flights (US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2020). Mazzeo (2003) emphasizes that on-time performance is a critical part of a consumer's perceived utility. Aggregate indicators of on-time performance (or the lack of it) also reflect the overall efficiency of a nation's civil aviation sector.====The economic impact of aviation delays includes an enhanced direct cost for the airline, lost man-hours for those traveling for work, and opportunity costs of time wastage for leisure (Peterson et al., 2013). A 2010 FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) study estimated the annual economic costs associated with flight delays at $31.2 billion (Ball et al., 2010). Another study by Ferguson et al. (2013) estimates these costs at $40.2 billion. The enormity of these estimates propels us to think of the enormous consequences and motivate the exploration of factors that relate to and can predict delays. We focus on aviation delays in the United States, with particular attention to the top four airlines, which account for around 70% of the domestic aviation market.====Various factors cause flight delays, including those which are outside the purview of airlines such as weather, air traffic control processes, security procedures (Bhat, 1995; Taylor, 1994). At the same time, these external contingencies impinge on each airline. In a competitive market, consumers make comparisons between different airlines, and it is the relative performance that counts (Park et al., 2004, 2006). Kim and Park (2016) establish that airline delays cause negative emotional responses, enhance negative word-of-mouth, and lower repurchase intention. Airline delay also impacts performance dimensions like pricing power, market share, and market growth. Forbes (2008) reports that each minute of delay reduces the ticket price by $1.42 on average, which increases with the degree of competition.====There is a dearth of studies relating airline delays to factors which the consumers can incorporate into their decision of which airline service to buy. This study considers consumer-centric factors such as the choice of airline, the departure day and time, and flight duration, as drivers of flight delays. The availability of heuristics like departure delay probability and arrival performance, as a function of airline and temporality is a primary aid to help consumers in making purchase decision(s). At a macro level, these indicators can guide policy-making, such as incentivizing on-time performance and managing airport congestion. Thus, our study aims to be of use to multiple stakeholders in the civil aviation industry.====We adopt a service failure and recovery framework in our analysis of flight delays. We characterize departure delays as initial service failures. Then we study the arrival performance as a service recovery opportunity. Making up for the initial departure delay by reduced arrival delay is considered a successful recovery. An increase in the eventual arrival delay, relative to the initial departure delay, is termed “double deviation” (Bitner et al., 1990). This analysis, being intuitive and straightforward, is a powerful heuristic that customers can employ while evaluating different airlines. The conceptual model is illustrated in Fig. 1.====Prior research has characterized and empirically assessed departure delay and waiting as service failure (Boshoff, 1997; Taylor, 1994; Wen and Geng-qing Chi, 2013). Thus delays are accepted as an important manifestation of service failure in travel services. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed departure delay as initial service failure and arrival performance as a service recovery opportunity.====We analyze the likelihood of departure delay and the likelihood of arrival performance, subject to departure delay. Specifically, we address the following research questions:====Subsequently, we address the following research questions concerning arrival performance of airlines modeled as the probability of three events- {recovery/no recovery/double deviation}:====Following this introduction, the rest of the paper is organized into six sections. We start by reviewing the existing literature. Subsequently, we present the analysis and results, first in terms of departures, and then in terms of arrival performance. Then we state the theoretical and managerial implications.

This paper evaluates the performance of the 38 Greek airports open to ","Greece is a small country of 131,957 sq. km located in Southeast Europe. Yet despite its size, Greece has 39 airports open to civil aviation. Greece has more than 2000 islands, of which 227 are inhabited, meaning that air transport plays a crucial role in connecting the different parts of the country. With a rich culture and history that goes back millennia, Greece is also one of the world's longest established tourism destinations, and Greek airports play a key role in supporting tourism by handling the flows of international incoming passengers “who after arrival spread to holiday resorts and various types of hospitality infrastructure (accommodation of various types) on the island or the surrounding areas of the airport” (Fragoudaki and Giokas, 2016).====In 2018, Greece's travel and tourism sector grew at a rate of 6.9%—three and a half times the pace of the national economy, which grew by 2% (WTTC, 2019). Greece's tourism sector represented 20.6% of the country's GDP, double the global average of 10.4%, and international visitor spending represented 27.9% of total exports; 66% of inbound Greek travel spending came from international visitors and 34% from domestic travel. The sector was driven by leisure spending, which comprised 94% tourist spending and 6% business (WTTC, 2019). As tourism plays such a crucial role in the country's economy, airports are the focus of attention of local authorities and central government, as well as potential investors. Thus, airport performance is of great interest to all parties and is the core research question of this paper.====The recent economic crisis had an extremely heavy impact on Greek society and the country as a whole. The Greek government's efforts to meet economic reform targets led to the decision to privatize 14 regional airports. To this end, the government invited private investors to submit offers “for the concession of the right to use, operate, manage and exploit 14 out of the 38 Regional Airports owned by the Greek State” (Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), 2013b, Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), 2013a) in March 2013. In December 2015, the HRADF (HRADF, 2015) and a consortium comprising mainly of the German group Fraport signed an agreement for the concession of 14 regional airports. This composed of two 40-year concessions to upgrade, maintain, manage and operate two clusters of seven regional airports each. The two clusters are as follows: Cluster A comprises of the airports of Thessaloniki, Kerkira, Kefalonia, Aktio, Zakinthos, Kavala and Chania; Cluster B comprises of the airports of Rhodos, Samos, Skiathos, Mytilene, Mykonos, Santorini and Kos (HRADF, 2017).====Since tourism plays such a crucial role in the economy of the country, airports performance has been the focus of attention of local authorities, central government as well as potential investors. “Investors and bankers that are interested in airport privatization want to use benchmarking techniques to identify possible business opportunities” (Graham, 2005). Based on the importance of tourism, which is considered “the pillar of the Greek economy”, the importance of Greek airports which mainly support tourism and the economy of the country, the recent economic crisis and the decision of the Greek Government to privatize airports for the first time in history, we considered the study of Greek airport performance a very challenging and timely research topic. The research questions we developed are: “What is the performance of the various 38 airports which vary in size, location and traffic?” “How did the Greek airports perform during the crisis years 2011 and 2015 just before privatization?” ‘Has the economic crisis affected airports badly and hindered their development?” “Do the 14 airports selected by the Government to be privatized show better performance and provide the best prospects?” Efficiency scores for each airport were estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis. The two years selected to examine airport performance here are 2011 and 2015. Both those years reflect the economic crisis period. In particular, 2011 was chosen as it was the reference year for airport profiles presented in the HRADF's invitation to prospective investors (Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund- HRADF-2013a,b). On the other hand, 2015 was chosen as it was the year prior to the privatization of the 14 airports (HRADF, 2015), as mentioned above. Empirical analysis was performed for all airports as well as by distinguishing between the two groups, in order to examine whether airports selected for privatization were the most efficient ones, promising high returns due to their characteristics.====In the two years examined in this paper, 2011 and 2015, despite the crisis, tourist numbers increased spectacularly from 16.4 million visitors in 2011 to 23.6 million visitors in 2015 (Bank of Greece, 2019—more than double the country's 11 million population (ELSTAT, 2019)—not including cruise ship passengers and economic immigrants. Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority (HCAA) statistics show an increase of about 26% in international incoming passengers and an increase of about 11% in total aircraft movements between 2011 and 2015 (HCAA, 2019a). This clearly demonstrates the strong contribution of tourism to the economy and the critical role of the airports.====Until recently, all Greek airports were owned by the Greek state and managed by the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority, with the exception of the new Athens International Airport (AIA), which was established as a public–private partnership and began operation in March 2001. Therefore, AIA is excluded in this paper as it operates under a completely different management regime. The Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority (HCAA; YPA in Greek) was established in 1926. “Its mission is the organization, development and control of the country's air transport infrastructure, as well as the study and laying of proposals to the Minister of Infrastructure, Transport and Networks concerning the overall policy formulation in air transport” (HCAA, 2019b).====Following the privatization of the 14 regional airports, the HCAA is still the regulator of Greek air transport including air-traffic control, as well as the manager of the remaining 24 airports. In the years 2011 and 2015, studied here, all 38 Greek airports were still under state management, where “charges at all airports are centrally set according to aircraft size, technical and flight operational characteristics” (Doganis et al., 1996). All airports “apply the same policies concerning user charges and, at the same time, they lack commercial strategy and management, as would be applied by business decision making units (DMUs)” (Fragoudaki and Giokas, 2016). In addition, employees enjoyed permanent tenure, as they were civil servants. However, the role of airports in the global aviation industry has changed: “from places where airplanes land and take off and where passengers and cargo are handled, airports are transformed from simple public utilities into business entities that successfully operate in an increasingly competitive environment” (Oxford Economics, 2008). Meanwhile, “airlines compete for slots at airports, whilst also pressing for lower user charges and passenger taxes” (Profillidis, 2010). It can be argued that until the recent airport privatization, Greek airports had not transformed into business entities, but remained as simple public utilities. However, following the privatization of the 14 regional airports, airport marketing and route development (Halpern and Graham, 2015) will certainly prove a top priority of Fraport Greece, the new manager of the 14 privatized regional airports.====This paper evaluates the operating efficiency of all 38 Greek airports prior to the completion of the privatization process. In addition, this paper analyzes and compares the performance of airports in the last stage of common ownership by the HCAA, by distinguishing between the two groups. The aim of this is to put forward that, even before privatization was concluded, privatized airports were of superior performance and prospects compared to those that remained under state (HCAA) management. This study can be viewed as a reference point for future research, as in the years to follow, Greek airports will be under different management schemes. To date, there have been no comparative studies examining the performance of privatized and state-managed airports in Greece.

Further, these organizations spend a lot of time to assess the situation and take corrective actions. This study examines passenger perceived bias and the airport security screening system.

According to the statistics reported by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the annual enplanement for all U.S commercial service airports in the year 2017 was estimated at over 760 million people which is about 3.6 percent more than the previous year (Pekoske, 2018). This amounts to quite a substantial proportion of the general population benefitting from the airport services. From a political perspective, airports provide opportunities for population growth and economic development within the regions they serve (Bilotkach et al., 2012; Florida et al., 2015).====In the United States, the aviation industry alone contributes to more than 6 percent of the nation's total gross domestic product. The importance of airport security forced the Department of Homeland Security to introduce more stringent regulations upon airport security by utilizing state of the art techniques to combat compromises even before the tragic event of September 11, 2001 otherwise known as 9/11. The tracking of transaction data and linking it with a biometric information database and the use of artificial intelligence to research crime databases began a new era in the immigration control and border enforcement forces (Amoore, 2006; Amoore and De Goede, 2008). After 9/11, Canada implemented more restrictive airport security screening similar to the U.S.====A major part of providing airport security is implementing check points at vulnerable locations within and around the airport facility. For a number of years, the screening process was contracted out to a private company that provides airport security screening services in Canada as well as some European and Middle Eastern countries (Security, 2011). Airport security screening by disgruntled employees of the private contract security screening company in Canada led to Canadian passengers waiting in long lines due to inefficient processing methods used to screen airline passengers (Cute, 2012; Janaillac, 2017). By 2014, the U.S. tightened security screening methods at its points of entry for citizens from some European and Asian countries who did not need a visa to get into the U.S. These countries included the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and Taiwan. Unfortunately, it is believed that these security measures may result in a bias towards certain groups of airline passenger. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine how airline passengers perceive they are treated as they pass through airport security check points. This is important because there have been a number of incidents reported in the press where airline passengers were mistreated during their air travel experience. The number of passenger grievances during the first three quarters of 2017 increased 8 percent over the prior year (Elliott, 2017). Both public and private organizations received negative publicity as a result of these incidents. Further, these organizations spent time and money to assess the situation and make changes where needed (Matousek, 2018).====Some of the innovations in security methods undertaken at the airports have been a point of controversy. With regular implementation of newer airport security techniques and measures, the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) reported security violations at all the airports in the U.S. country were relatively small (Lum et al., 2013). However, there is limited research on social justice and interventions. Even though stated TSA protocol requires everyone to go through the security checkpoint, it is up to the TSA officers' discretion as to whether additional screening is necessary. United States Customs Services reserve the authority to perform secondary security procedures on airline passengers.====For decades, such practices have fueled controversies with numerous reports of lawsuits against discrimination and inappropriate behavior by the Customs Services officers. In an effort to better understand the relationship between airport security systems and passengers’ perception of the security systems, this study will attempt to answer the following research questions: (1) Is the perceived bias a result of the technology used at screening checkpoints? (2) Is the perceived bias a result of training of TSA personnel? (3) Is the screening system designed to select passengers randomly without any identifiers? (4) Is the screening system designed to examine every passenger as they go through the primary screening?====This study uses social justice theory as it relates to passengers and airport security screening. Prior research suggests that customers are influenced by the fairness of how they are treated and their overall satisfaction with the systems in place (Sindhav et al., 2006). However, as noted above, there is limited research on social justice in airport screening and passenger discrimination. The present study will attempt to fill this gap in the literature.

PIA managers can now better understand the importance of service quality and its long-term benefits in the form of customer loyalty.,"Today service quality (SQ) has become a critical consideration for the airlines in the competitive global market. SQ and customer satisfaction are very important concepts that companies must understand in order to remain competitive in the market (Chow, 2014; Hussain et al., 2015; Chen, 2016; Ghorabaee et al., 2017; Gupta, 2017). Better SQ not only gives a firm a competitive advantage to an airline, but it also leads to retention of customer patronage which consequently leads to an increase in market share (Park et al., 2004; Morash and Ozment, 1994). It is essential for companies to know how to assess their SQ from the consumers’ perspective and stay customer focused in order to better understand their needs and how to satisfy them.====The importance of the airline industrial sector in the economic development of a country cannot be denied. It facilitates people or product mobility from one place to another, whether this happens within the country or beyond borders. Since the beginning of the current decade the air transport market is becoming even more challenging and competitive, many airlines have now started to focus on airline SQ to increase its passenger satisfaction (Archana and Subha, 2012; Basfirinci and Mitra, 2015; Murali et al., 2016; van Lierop and El-Geneidy, 2016). Also, Aksoy et al. (2003) reported that modern marketing practices include “understanding, creating, communicating, and delivering customer value and satisfaction”, while modern business philosophy includes focusing on customer. Furthermore, the primary aim of businesses is customer service satisfaction. To increase the satisfaction of customers, air lines mostly prefer to come with some new strategies. Use of in-flight entertainment systems (IFEs) is one of them. According to Alamdari (1999) use of IFEs (in form of audio/video system) has become a more fascinating tool in airline industry. IFEs are available for any type of flights. Some of the multimedia IFEs include Video-on demand, music channels, telephone, information regarding destination, gambling, financial services, camera through which external view can be enjoyed, air map display, and computer games have been provided to improve passenger's ambience to keep them involved, entertained, and comfortable during the flight. Indeed such entertained travel experience will indirectly create association which will lead to customer's behavioral intentions to repurchase services in future.====Currently, there are three airlines operating in Pakistan i.e., Shaheen Air International (SAI), Airblue, Air Indus and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). PIA is the flag carrier of Pakistan and it is the only state-owned airline of the country. It connects 24 cities within Pakistan and operates schedule services to 38 international destinations in 27 countries across Asia, Middle East, Europe and North America (PIAC, 2013). Here it is important to mention that product and SQ of PIA is rated as a 3-star international airline by SKYTRAX, the airline quality rating organization that uses evaluations of airline by customers from all over the world (SKYTRAX, 2013). According to the organization, 3-star rating is awarded to airlines delivering a fair quality performance, but with greater levels of inconsistency. The present study addresses service quality of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) by including passenger satisfaction and behavioral intentions in a single comprehensive model.====Based on the preceding debate, the objective of this research is to examine the impact of service quality on behavioral intentions of PIA passengers under mediating effect of passenger's satisfaction.",The impact of airline service quality on passengers’ behavioral intentions using passenger satisfaction as a mediator,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699717301874,13 April 2020,2020,Research Article,379.0

Moreover, public health crises of the past decades, like SARS in 2003 or the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, have highlighted how easy it is for diseases to spread around the world very rapidly, leveraging the air transportation, especially nowadays that air-traveling allowed everyone to travel anywhere in the world within a day. As experienced with the ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is of high importance the air transportation industry (airports, long-haul airlines, authorities, etc.), which services may act as the medium for transmitting and spreading infectious diseases, to be specifically prepared for addressing threats like global epidemics.====According to ==== Europe remains an important linchpin in international traveling. It must be also noted that 4 out of 10 internationally connected airports belong to European countries, which are Heathrow (United Kingdom), Frankfurt (Germany), Amsterdam Schiphol (Netherlands) and Charles de Gaulle (France). Therefore, there is an acute need to understand and predict the patterns that pathogens follow as they are highly possible to reach one of the European airports and though them to be spread in the European countries. Thus, the question raised here is: which airports (or complete network regions) are more sensitive/critical for controlling a possible disease spread? Subsequently, what are the methodological means that can be used for testing control policies for avoiding the spreading of such pathogens and where to apply quarantine or block measures for controlling a possible spread?====In order to study the phenomenon of disease spreading from in cases of global epidemics a four step process is applied here:====Starting with the ====, in the current paper network complexity analysis is conducted, which has proven important in controlling network epidemics (====, ====). In particular, several centrality metrics are used and applied for identifying ‘central’ nodes of the air transport system (mainly airports), namely, Degree, Betweenness and Closeness Centrality. Each metric provided an indication of the airports' importance according to the type of connections these have with the rest of the European and non-European airports, a fact that suggest possible future facilitation of disease spreading within the European region through them. Additionally to the information on critical nodes (airports), policy-making also require additional information on the different effects that Europe may face in the case of different starting locations of infectious diseases. Moreover, in case of a global epidemic outbreak, it is important to know the epidemics dynamics related to transportation that European cities/countries will face.====The purpose of developing these scenarios was the estimation of the possible disease outbreak dynamics within the European region when the outbreak originates from the three different continents. Based on the results, European countries are exposed more in possible diseases outbreaks originated from Africa and Asia. Besides this finding, this approach was able also to identify the parameters that may facilitate the disease spreading in the European region.====In ====, in order to identify the critical nodes (or regions) for controlling an epidemic outbreak, extensive stress-test subject to the characteristics of hypothetical viruses are conducted, controlling the transmission rates, estimating the effects in European countries in terms of spreading dynamics. By performing such stress-tests, the control measures that should be taken for each type of contagious virus and virus starting location (continents) can be identified. Identifying the critical airports (or even large parts of the airline network like those of regions or countries) within Europe, combined with the popularity/criticality of the airports and the information obtained based on the continental analysis developed for a disease outbreak inside the European region, provide significant information on which European countries and airports are prone to a possible disease outbreak, an element crucial for supporting decisions for controlling phenomena of global disease outbreaks.====Finally, in ====, investigation on the most effective time that controlling actions should be applied is undertaken. By taking into account the dynamic nature of an epidemic, the time that controlling actions are applied in the transportation network stands for a crucial element for breaking the transmission chain and ultimately stop the spread of an epidemic incident. This investigation is based on an ‘aggressive’ type of virus (in terms of transmission rates) and focused on Italy under the conditions running since the beginning of 2020. Starting from January 2020 when Italy detected its first coronavirus cases, and based on the evolution of this virus after almost two months, it turned out that the COVID-19 virus spreading in Italy was extremely severe and thousands of people were infected and many of them lost their lives (====). In this Step, the dramatic effect of the time that control measures taken is highlighted, since slight delays in necessary gating decisions may result in uncontrolled spreading of an aggressive infectious virus throughout a large region.====Overall, this research provided a step-by-step approach for modelling future outbreaks spreading dynamics through the airlines network and identify critical nodes/airports (or even critical regions and countries) and the time that such actions should be applied in order to control infectious disease spreading. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section ====, provides an overview of related literature.

The increase in air traffic flow creates pressure on air transport infrastructures and networks. Therefore, decision-makers need to develop and utilize efficient evaluation and analysis tools based on the limited availability of resources. Inspired by the underlying structure of queues for air traffic flow, a Petri-net-based model is developed in this study to characterize the system performance. In this study, air transportation networks are analyzed using a series of performance indicators that are based on a discrete-event system model.","The development of the air traffic system increases the demand for airport services, which further justifies the need for more efficient airport terminal services. The long-term plans include the expansion of runway systems at existing airports (Samà et al., 2017; Bennell et al., 2011). Punctuality is a significant concern in all transportation networks, especially for an existing network with several interdependent “services.” Therefore, there is a need to develop a decision support tool that can be used for assessing airport terminal performance. (see Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 11)====Instead of finding out how a terminal control system behaves by considering every possible detail, it might be more realistic to model a terminal control system from a macroscopic view, while capturing its main underlying structure. The air traffic system is a class of dynamic systems in which the behavior is similar to that of a discrete event system (Han et al., 2017). Compared with continuous-time systems, the evolution of a discrete event system depends only on the occurrence of discrete events (Subiono et al., 2018). Fortunately, several tools, such as Petri nets and queuing networks, are available for conducting the system analysis of discrete events (Mahjoub et al., 2017). A terminal control area is a common type of “production” system, where a “production” line consists of sub-segments or flights in series (Ariano et al., 2015; Samà et al., 2017). Currently, flight flow is controlled by air traffic controllers, who monitor aircraft trajectories and give instructions to pilots to prevent mid-air collisions (Sabhnani et al., 2010). The airspace is typically partitioned into elementary modules, and they can be combined together to form sectors (Martinez et al., 2007). It is well-known that specified routes can be followed to maintain the safe horizontal or vertical separation between aircraft, especially in situations of congestion (Murça and Müller, 2015). In research and practice, performance indicators are widely used to characterize the performance of a given transportation system (Schopferer et al., 2016). However, in such a system, performance analysis could become complicated owing to the variety of aircraft types.====In addition to this motivation for conducting the performance evaluation, recent developments have occurred in terminal control practices. Concepts such as 4D trajectory and collaborative decision making are now widely known and accepted. Thus, the fundamental question is the following: should we adopt any of these practices? This paper is divided into five sections. In Section 2, previous studies based on modeling techniques are reviewed, indicating the need for the development and use of such a decision support tool. In Section 3, the overall methodological approach adopted in this study is presented. The evaluation is detailed in Section 4, using an example. Finally, the conclusions of the study and directions for future research are discussed in Section 5.",Characterizing the performance of queuing networks in terminal control systems,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301620,8 April 2020,2020,Research Article,381.0

This study decomposes the drivers influencing China's ,"The signing of the ==== opened a new phase of climate change governance for all sectors. The civil aviation industry is developing more rapidly than other sectors worldwide, and it is expected to be double the 2012 level by 2027 (Chiaramonti et al., 2014). The global airline industry's daily jet fuel consumption has exceeded 5 million barrels since 2013, resulting in significant carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions (Liu et al., 2017a). There has also been a decrease in the marginal energy use efficiency and an increase in air transportation demand. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO, 2013) projected that the total air transportation demand may reach as high as 2.5–3 times the 2010 level by 2020. As such, aviation's contribution to climate change is projected to increase in the future. Boeing (2012) predicted that CO==== emissions from global airlines might soar to 1.23–1.49 billion tons in 2025. This level is almost equivalent to Japan's CO==== emissions in 2013. Given this, aviation could gradually become a dominant source of CO==== emissions (Grote et al., 2014).====Reforms in China have significantly promoted the development of the civil aviation industry, which has in turn stimulated China's economic growth. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), air transportation revenue has maintained an annual growth rate of 19.75% in the past 30 years, increasing from 1.85 billion yuan in 1985 to 413.11 billion yuan in 2015 (CAAC, 2016). This represents 1.08% of China's GDP in 2015. During the same period, China's civil aviation sector's Revenue Ton Kilometers (RTK) expanded from 1.271 billion ton km to 85.17 billion ton km, yielding an annual average growth rate of 15.05%.====The significant growth in the scale of air transportation has led to environmental changes due to civil aviation carbon emissions. In 2015, China's civil aviation CO==== emissions reached 78.87 million tons (Mt), which accounted for 0.22% of the global anthropogenic CO==== emissions (ICAO, 2016). Because of the large and still increasing scale of the demand for air transportation and the ongoing dispute about introducing civil aviation CO==== emissions into the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, CO==== emissions from aircrafts have attracted increased attention in China (Scheelhaase et al., 2010). As such, China's 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Civil Aviation recommended that civil aviation establish a concept for green development, efficiently use energy resources, optimize the aviation energy-saving operating environment, and focus on improving transport productivity. In 2009, the CAAC established a 22% CI (CO==== emissions per RTK) reduction target for China's civil aviation industry by 2020, as compared to the 2005 level (CAAC, 2011).====Despite increasing attention by the government and the industry, relatively few studies have focused on China's civil aviation CO==== emissions. Loo and Li (2012) calculated the volume of CO==== emissions from the perspective of passenger transport between 1949 and 2009. He and Xu (2011) and Fan et al. (2010) estimated China's civil aviation CO==== emissions using fuel-based (top-down) methods. Predicting China's future civil aviation carbon emissions is critical in overcoming possible future problems. Therefore, some studies focused on addressing the issue of CO==== emissions with the future development of China's civil aviation sector. One study is by Zhou et al. (2016), who conducted a scenario analysis of civil aviation CO==== emissions and assessed the impact of crucial factors on emissions. Specifically, they analyzed the factors influencing changes in historical carbon emissions, and then explored the potential evolution of different factors under different scenarios to project future carbon emission trends. Similar studies can be found that explore China's carbon emissions by combining influencing factor analysis and scenario analysis (Guan et al., 2008; Lin and Ouyang, 2014; Zhou et al., 2016).====Previous scenario analysis studies mainly chose the factors affecting civil aviation CO==== emissions based on the authors’ discretion. Index decomposition analysis (IDA) is a commonly used method to quantify the internal drivers of energy/emission change, and can avoid the arbitrariness in determining the influencing factors to some extent. The IDA method generally includes the Laspeyres, Divisia, Fisher, Paasche, and Marshall-Edgeworth index approaches and their transformations (Wang et al., 2015). Of these, the Laspeyres and Divisia index approaches are the most popular (Ang, 2004). The Laspeyres decomposition method measures the percentage change in a group of projects over time, using the weights based on a base year. In contrast, the Divisia decomposition method is the weighted sum of the logarithmic growth rate, where the weight is the share of each component in the total value, given in the form of a line integral (Wang et al., 2014). After systematically comparing the application and methodology of the Laspeyres and Divisia index approaches, Ang (2015) encouraged the general use of the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI), because of its theoretical foundation, adaptability, ease of use, and interpretation of results. The LMDI method has been widely used to quantitatively identify factors driving changes in CO==== emissions (Liu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017; Lin and Long, 2016).====In addition, scenario analyses in the existing literature have been limited to setting a fixed rate of the change in each influencing factor. In reality, the future evolution of different variables is usually uncertain. Therefore, for each variable, the potential change in rate should be a range of values, rather than one specific value. To address these challenges, some studies have introduced Monte Carlo simulations; examples include studies by Lin and Liu (2010) and Shao et al. (2017). These studies have applied Monte Carlo simulations to predict the carbon emission trend. However, they do not reveal the dynamic internal connections between carbon emissions and different scenarios. If scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulation can be organically combined, the complementary advantages of the two could help in scientifically predicting evolutionary trends and probability distributions of carbon emissions under different scenarios.====Table 1 summarizes the studies exploring future civil aviation carbon emissions at different levels. Existing relevant studies have achieved several effective results in projecting civil aviation carbon emissions in the medium- and long-term future (Owen et al., 2010; Gudmundsson and Anger, 2012; Zhou et al., 2016). However, few quantitative studies explicitly focused on the factors affecting China's civil aviation carbon emissions. The main factors include reducing civil aviation carbon intensity, peaks in carbon emissions, carbon emission reduction potential, and emission reduction paths. When considering the future development of the civil aviation sector, it can be difficult to explore the dynamic evolution of these factors and corresponding policy measures. These topics are rarely discussed in extant literature.====This study provides information for policy makers, by quantitatively discussing future emission trends at a macro level, and exploring the possibility and feasibility of achieving the carbon emission reduction target. As compared to the existing studies shown in Table 1, this study makes three key contributions. First, the study develops an appropriate decomposition method under the ICAO's emission reduction framework. Four factors affecting civil aviation carbon emissions are identified, and each influencing factor's contribution to historical carbon emission reduction is quantitatively measured. The decomposition results are referenced to establish the future development trend of China's civil aviation. Second, the study considers stage characteristics. In the process of parameter setting, four identified factors are set into three different stages: 2016–2020, 2021–2025, and 2026–2030. Third, using a Monte Carlo simulation, this study dynamically analyzes the scenarios that predict evolutionary trends in civil aviation carbon emissions and CI. Based on results, this study discusses reduction potential and paths to reduce future civil aviation carbon emissions, with respect to the sector's emission reduction targets. This provides a reference to rationally formulate and implement future carbon emission reduction policies.",Flying into the future: A scenario-based analysis of carbon emissions from China's civil aviation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301401,7 April 2020,2020,Research Article,382.0

Personal hassles include work-family conflicts and physical health problems. The findings of this study provided a further understanding on hassle experiences on cabin crew.","The aviation industry in recent years has been experiencing many significant changes ever since the advent of low-cost carriers entered into the market (Holtbrügge et al., 2006). Although front-line employees play an important role in presenting the efficiency and services of airlines to customers, Snipes et al. (2005) suggested that in a highly competitive environment, the cabin crew actually bear more responsibilities than front-line employees in terms of safety, security, and passenger service. In addition, cabin crew face many negative work conditions while performing duties, including working long hours in a confined and relatively stressful space, and being exposed to a work environment with a certain degree of pollution sources (Chen and Chen, 2012), from which cabin crew often experience a high degree of frustration and distress while performing flying duties. Therefore, it is important to understand the hassles of cabin crew.====The public impression is stereotyped that cabin crew have an appealing and easy job, as they could travel to many destinations without extra cost, enjoy free dining and accommodation provided by the airlines, and have elevated socioeconomic status (Chen and Chen, 2012). However, little research has been conducted to explore the hassles experienced by the cabin crew. The characteristics of the cabin crew profession include job autonomy, long working hours (Williams, 2003), irregular work schedules (Castro et al., 2015), physiological work stresses caused by noise and vibration in the cabin (MacDonald et al., 2003), and physical illnesses and mental exhaustion caused by jet lag (Chen and Chen, 2012; McNeely et al., 2018). These special work characteristics result in physical and psychological hassles to cabin crew.====Kelleher and McGilloway (2005) pointed out that when cabin crew are providing service on duty, they are exposed to negative work conditions such as irregular work schedules (Chen and Chen, 2012), potential flight safety accidents, noise and vibration, limited work space (MacDonald et al., 2003), and passengers' unruly in-flight behaviors (Tsang et al., 2018), coupled with stringent work requirements and airline policies that increase their workload (Chen and Chen, 2012). The stress that they perceive while on duty makes them feel hassled. Second, they work in a team, but sometimes with colleagues that they never worked with before. During the flight on duty, cabin crew must blend their personalities to accommodate the teamwork, in order to ensure efficient operation of the team and meet passengers' needs. Due to the unfamiliarity between colleagues and the lack of a tacit understanding among the team members, they often have conflicts while performing their duties, leading to frustration for cabin crew (Smith et al., 2000). Third, Chen and Chen (2014) argued that cabin crew's work is mainly to provide passenger services in the cabin. Their services can be regarded as a type of emotional work (Hochschild, 1983). Cabin crew must act calm and professional when they deal with demanding or insulting passengers, thus presenting the emotions expected by passengers often makes them feel stressful (Chen and Kao, 2012). In addition, compared to other industries, female cabin crew are more vulnerable to sexual harassment by passengers (Gunnarsdottir et al., 2006; Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission, 2014), creating a different type of hassle. Finally, cabin crew are front-line employees in the aviation industry who often travel overseas, making it difficult for them to maintain normal social relationships with family and friends, whether at home or at work (Ballard et al., 2004; Bergman and Gillberg, 2015).====Hassle was originally defined as “irritating, frustrating, distressing demands that to some degree characterize everyday transactions with the environment” (Kanner et al., 1981, p. 3), as well as the annoying life problems that people encounter every day. Visser and Rothmann (2009) argued that hassles recur every day and are role-related stressors. Past studies have revealed that hassles can lead to negative personal and work-related outcomes. Negative personal outcomes include negative emotions such as anger, anxiety and disappointment (Falconier et al., 2015; Swim et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2010), mental health (Tajalli et al., 2010), physical well-being (Falconier et al., 2015), and life and family satisfaction (Lavee and Ben-Ari, 2008). Moreover, negative work-related outcomes include increased subjective workload (Zohar, 1999), stress (Leung and Wu, 2014), exhaustion (Visser and Rothmann, 2009), and burnout (Chen and Kao, 2013).====Previous studies on cabin crew mainly focused on job stress (Chen and Kao, 2011; MacDonald et al., 2003), burnout (Chen and Kao, 2012), emotional labor (Bergman and Gillberg, 2015; Lee et al., 2018), job satisfaction (Kim and Back, 2012; Ng et al., 2011), organizational commitment (Chen, 2006), work engagement (Chen and Chen, 2012), leadership (Tsai and Su, 2011), high-performance work practices (Karatepe and Vatankhah, 2015), and cabin crew scheduling (Kasirzadeh et al., 2017; Yan and Tu, 2002). As mentioned above, hassles can lead to negative personal and work-related outcomes for cabin crew. However, few studies have explored the types of hassles that may exist in cabin crew's work and personal lives. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the hassle experiences of cabin crew, in order to offer suggestions on reducing negative personal and work-related outcomes.====Related studies on the natures of hassles have been developed in the field of psychology for many years. Kanner et al. (1981) first discussed hassles encountered by the general public in daily life. Subsequently, many studies focused on the hassles of special groups such as adolescents (Wright et al., 2010), middle aged adults (Maybery, 2003), elder adults (Lapierre et al., 2012), college students (Nguyen-Michel et al., 2006; Pett and Johnson, 2005), couples (Falconier et al., 2015), immigrants (Abouguendia and Noels, 2001; Titzmann et al., 2011), and wilderness visitors (Peden and Schuster, 2008). Moreover, previous studies also targeted the hassles encountered by specific occupation practitioners in their life and work, such as call centre workers (Visser and Rothmann, 2009), nurse (Beaudoin and Edgar, 2003), police officers (Hart et al., 1993), tour guides (Tsaur and Lin, 2014), and urban bus drivers (Evans et al., 1999). Because of the characteristics of different industries, the work environments and work contents are different; but previous studies did not explore the hassles encountered by cabin crew. This research gap is the focus of this study.====Cabin crew are very important front-line employees in the aviation industry. If they encounter hassles in their life and work, then this will negatively affect their job satisfaction, work performance, and physical and mental health. Therefore, in order to develop hassle prevention and coping strategies, it is necessary for the management of the aviation industry to first understand the hassles in cabin crew's life and work. A full understanding of the hassle can help cabin crew prepare for the career they have chosen and deal with hassles effectively. Therefore, in order to fill the gap in the literature, this study conducted in-depth interviews and content analysis to carry out the qualitative research, with the aim to identify the hassles experienced by cabin crew in their life and work.",Hassles of cabin crew: An exploratory study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969971930256X,31 March 2020,2020,Research Article,383.0

However, the preassigned seat configuration of certain flight legs can be changed often due to aircraft changes for certain reasons, such as maintenance and reservation rates. Then certain customer's seat features, such as row location, position of aisle/window, relative location, and position with the same group member can be different before/after the change, and it can lead to huge customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, an efficient airline seat reallocation algorithm to minimize customer dissatisfaction is introduced in this study, which is based on mathematical model-based optimization with several types of objective functions that reflect customer dissatisfaction levels. A numerical example is performed to validate the developed airline seat reallocation algorithm, and an additional analysis is also executed to derive important insight.","For the last fifty years, worldwide tourism demand has been increasing, and it is now taking a big part of global economy (Peng et al., 2015). According to the UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organization) tourism highlights 2017 edition, international tourist arrivals were 25 million in 1950, and they increased to 1235 million in 2016. In addition, international tourism accounted for 7% of global exports about goods and services in 2016. Among overnight visitors, 55% of them travelled through air transportation, which means the demand of worldwide travel is closely related to air transportation. Therefore, the airline industry could prosper along with the increasing demand of worldwide travel. The initial FSCs (full service carriers) provided services such as free meals or amenities, so the customers could regard the flights as part of their journey. However, the generalization of worldwide travel led to an increased demand for affordable air transportation while intensifying the competition between airlines. This phenomenon led to the advent of LCCs (low cost carriers) that concentrate on no-frills but with cheaper ticket prices in order to attract more customers (Ko, 2019).====LCCs, which have a business structure that can generate profit at low fares, started to attract many travelers while threatening other carriers (Belobaba et al., 2015). LCCs focus on the basic role of transportation with minimized service compared to FSCs, and they provide 30–40% lower airfares than FSCs (Ko and Hwang, 2011). As expected, LCCs succeeded in attracting many passengers who are price-sensitive. The market share of people who used FSCs decreased 11.8% between 2003 and 2015, while the share of LCC passengers increased by 61% from 2007 to 2016 (Atallah et al., 2018). To regain the market share from LCCs, FSCs are trying many different strategies to acquire bigger market share through operating AWAs (airlines within airlines), which are the lower cost subsidiaries (Pearson and Merkert, 2014), or by diversifying the products to provide for the passengers, which can satisfy them better (Hazledine, 2011).====According to David Mc A, 2013, if the consumers are satisfied with the service quality of a typical airline, they expect the level of service quality to increase. This means that as better service is provided to consumers, the more consumers are going to be loyal to the company. Therefore, FSCs are differentiating themselves from LCCs by providing various services, such as onboard services or systematic services for the customer's convenience (Koklic et al., 2017). FSCs are providing many different services, such as passenger lounges, loyalty programs for customers, and free food, which are known as traditional air travel service. In addition, kiosk check-in or e-tickets are also provided. Still, airlines are trying to differentiate the service they provide, so they can draw more customers. Between those services, the services that can reflect the demand of typical passengers are receiving the attention. In other words, passengers can select the seat they want through an advance seat selection service.====Currently, many airlines provide an advance seat selection service. As the number of people who use air transportation increases, the needs of the people are also diversifying. In general, specific seats are allocated to passengers when they try to check-in at the airport. However, passengers can select the seats that they want in advance via the airline's app or webpage. An advance seat selection service lets passengers select the seats that they want on a first-come-first-served basis. Some of the seats that are wider than others, such as the ones where the emergency exits are allocated to the passengers who can help the flight attendants in emergency situations, but passengers who are able to serve the essential jobs in emergencies can sit there through an advance seat selection service. Passengers can use advance seat selection service not only to take the seats that have obvious advantages, such as the emergency exit seats or the front row seats where a bassinet can be installed, but they can also choose one of the seats they prefer even if it doesn't have a special feature. The seats that have general features are usually categorized into window and aisle seats, or the seats in the front row or the rear row. In other cases, if the passengers are in a group, they might want to sit close to each other. These kind of complicated demands from passengers can occur.====Even though the service can provide a convenience to customers, it can possibly cause dissatisfaction during certain situations, which is usually called service failure. The airline industry is keen to prevent service failures, because airline customers are sensitive to the relationship with the company. Therefore, it is important to make an effort to prevent service failures and have an appropriate counterplan (Palmer and Bejou, 2016). One of the issues is a change of aircraft according to an airline's inevitable situation. In this case, a different seat configuration can cause a problem for the advance seat selection service. For example, if a certain flight changed from Airbus-A380 into Boeing-B737, the seat configuration converts from 3-3-3 into 3-3. Then two of the aisle seats decrease, which can lead to some of the seats arbitrarily changing. The change of seats that passengers reserved through an advance seat selection service can make the dissatisfaction larger than the convenience. However, as was mentioned previously, this kind of situation can occur at any moment. Therefore, the solution to minimize the dissatisfaction of passengers who used an advance seat selection service needs to be devised.====In this study, an efficient airline seat reallocation algorithm to minimize the customer dissatisfaction is introduced that considers the situation when the seat change is suggested. There are various cases where seats are changed, such as aisle seat being changed to window seats or seats of group customers are separated. By calculating the dissatisfaction of the cases that can occur, an optimal way of allocating new seats for passengers will be presented.",An efficient airline seat reallocation algorithm considering customer dissatisfaction,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719305368,28 March 2020,2020,Research Article,384.0

In this problem, a carrier airline has to reschedule flights and requests to adapt to last-minute demand changes. We consider three different possible crew ==== that translate into three different way to evaluate the costs of deviating from the original schedule. We formulated the ACSRP as a mixed integer linear programming problem, and tested our implementation on 24 original schedules with up to 30 orders and 8 airports, and 4 different disruption scenarios for each one. Our results show that, against a benchmark recovery policy where only cargo is re-routed, recovery can yield savings of roughly 10%.","Air cargo is essential for the global economy because it enables the seamless integration of markets worldwide. It is a fast and reliable alternative, which makes it particularly attractive in markets where capital costs are high, and where it is consequently crucial to try to minimize shipping times. Although aircraft shipments currently represent 1% of the total tonnage moved by the cargo market, this figure increases to 35% when measured by value instead of weight (IATA, 2018).====In the last decade (2007–2017), air cargo has grown by 2.6%, and this rate is expected to rise to 4.2% in the next 20 years as a consequence of synchronized global economic expansion, increasing industrial production, world trade growth and widespread growth of e-commerce (Boeing, 2018). There are two main ways that air cargo can be transported: using dedicated freighters or using the remaining space in the luggage compartments of passenger aircraft (or, as it is usually called, in the “belly” of the plane). For combination carriers (i.e., carriers that transport both passengers and cargo), the use of belly space can be a very attractive alternative because it allows transporting cargo at a relatively small additional cost. However, restrictions in volume, security standards and regulations may prevent some cargo to be shipped in the belly of a plane, requiring the use of freighters. Even combination carriers, as LATAM airlines that have a vast passenger network with more than 300 aircraft, transport 35% of their cargo in their nine freighters (LATAM, 2018). Furthermore, freighters provide a reliable capacity level that can be planned in advance, as opposed to belly space which depends on how much luggage passengers check in for a specific flight (Morrell, 2011; Kasilingam, 1997). Additionally, freighter routes are planned according to the requests, and are independent from passenger demand patterns. This allows for more direct routes and shorter shipping times, which are crucial for high-value, time-sensitive products. Altogether, these factors explain that even when freighters represent 8% of the total commercial jet fleet, they generate almost 90% of air cargo revenue (Boeing, 2018).====The planning required for freighter operations is a complex task, especially for carriers that operate in markets that have directional imbalance, as it is the case of our partner airline operating in the Americas. Airlines need to plan their schedules in advance to enable them to reserve the necessary crews and aircraft. However, it is very hard to make accurate demand forecasts in the air cargo industry, and this is owing to its high unpredictability. This variability comes from many sources. First, requests tend to be large in size (smaller ones are easier to fulfill using belly space), and they are placed by a reduced number of customers (Moussawi-Haidar, 2014). Second, requests are usually placed on relatively short notice (Sandhu and Klabjan, 2006). Third, the routes of the passenger aircraft (i.e., belly space capacity) are planned in accordance to the passengers’ demand for trips, which does not usually match the demand for air cargo. Finally, the size of requests placed in advance may differ from that stated in the original reservation (Amaruchkul et al., 2007; Huang and Lu, 2015; Levin et al., 2012), or sometimes they do not even show up. This happens because there are usually no penalties in place for order no-shows (Wada et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2015; Moussawi-Haidar, 2014).====Given the unreliability of demand forecasting, airlines are forced to redesign their schedules on a daily basis (Friederichs et al., n.d.). In many airlines, this process is done manually by an experienced planner, who can change the routing of an aircraft, reroute cargo, or even cancel or add flights. Evidently, this manual process does not guarantee an efficient solution. The impact of uncertainty can be significant to the airline, in that the airplane may end up flying with very low load factors, or in some cases, it may even be unable to serve some requests, which in a tight margin industry could result in losses.====The aim of this paper is to formally introduce and solve this re-scheduling problem that arises in the short-term planning process for freighters. We call this problem the air cargo schedule recovery problem (ACSRP). We borrow the term “recovery” from the passenger transportation version of the problem. In passenger transportation, the disruptions occur on the supply side (e.g., an unscheduled maintenance of an aircraft) which forces the airline to find a way to return (i.e., recover) to the original schedule within a given time frame, usually as short as possible, minimizing the negative effects on operative costs and passengers. In our version of the problem, the objective is to reschedule the freighters and reroute (and eventually cancel) requests in light of the demand disruptions, taking into account the operative costs and the costs that follow from adjusting the schedule. Although the recovery problem has been previously researched for the passenger airline industry, as far as we could corroborate this is the first article that deals with the air cargo recovery problem.====It is worth noting that, although the original scheduling problem and the recovery problem seem to be very similar, there are essential differences between both problems that justify the need of a specialized tool for each. The main difference stems from how early the planning takes places, and the options that are available. A key resource that must be treated differently between these two problems is crew capacity: when a crew is scheduled to fly in the next days, it might be too late to reschedule it. This means that in the recovery problem, originally scheduled crews must be treated (at least partially) as a sunken cost. In the context of this work, we define a ==== (or just policy) as a policy followed by an airline that regulates the how flexible the crews are to last minute schedule modifications. A policy translates into a particular set of rules that allow to estimate the crew rescheduling costs for a particular recovery solution. We call these sets of rules a ====.====In this work we analyze three different policies regarding crew rescheduling that different airlines may follow. We name these policies ====, ==== and ====, and define them as follows:====These three different policies represent different approaches to deal with the trade-off between flexibility and the level of crew inconvenience. For example, policy ==== is a stricter version of policy ====, so it should always yield solutions that are more expensive but also less inconvenient to the crews than the solutions from ====. It is not possible, however, to apply this logic to establish a relationship between ==== and the other policies, because the kind of flexibility involved is essentially different. Policy ==== permits modifications in the routing of the fleet, but allows little flexibility for rescheduling the time of the flights. On the other hand, policies ==== and ==== allow for changes in the departure time of a flight, but restricts the origin and destination airports of the flight to remain unchanged. In other words, policy ==== gives the airline spatial flexibility, while policies ==== and ==== give the airline temporal flexibility.====In order to incorporate these three policies in the mathematical formulation of the ACSRP, we define three comparison schemes (====, ====, and ====) that correspond to each policy. These comparison schemes enable the comparison of the original and recovered schedules, and provide an estimation of the additional costs incurred in the recovery. They work by translating each policy into a series of additional variables and constraints that need to be included in the MILP formulation of the ACSRP so that the resulting total costs effectively reflect the ones implied by the policy of the airline.====When dealing with the ACSRP, it is of special interest to allow cargo to be transshipped. Unlike when dealing with passengers, the total travel time between the origin and destination, and even the number of connections that are made by a request is not relevant as long as it is delivered to its final destination within the desired time window (Sandhu and Klabjan, 2006; Amaruchkul et al., 2007). This consideration, which has not been taken into account by previous works dealing with this recovery problem, can lead to better solutions; however, it needs to be considered during the formulation of the problem, and this could make it harder to solve.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present a brief literature review regarding the problem. In Section 3, we provide a formal description of the ACSRP, providing a MILP formulation of the problem based on an extended space-time network, including the definition and formulation of the three comparison schemes. Section 4 contains numerical experiments that are based on real data, as well as a discussion on the results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude the paper and present some possible future lines of research.",Recovering from demand disruptions on an air cargo network,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719302479,19 March 2020,2020,Research Article,385.0

Results indicated that residents' risk perception near Taoyuan Airport is lower than that near Kaohsiung Airport. Noise pollution experience, perceived probability of environmental contamination and negative effects, and perceived severity of catastrophic consequences significantly increase residents' perceived risks. Residents are willing to recognize and participate in mitigating the risks of aircraft noise pollution. The more risk residents perceive, the more willing they are to participate in disaster reduction and investigate means of improving the risk environment.","In Taiwan, foreign import and export trade rely on international air and water transportation. Hence, airports play a critical role in air transportation by providing international throughput, passenger transportation, and cargo transportation. Successfully developing airports stimulates employment and economic development in cities. However, the construction and development of any airport entails environmental effects such as noise, air, and water pollution and damage to animal habitats. The most critical environmental effect is noise pollution because of its immediate and detectable effect on surrounding residents. Aircraft noise results from factors such as aircraft takeoff and landing frequency, aircraft movement, and aircraft approaching communities. Prolonged exposure to noise may cause residents to be prone to irritability, nervousness, headaches, depression, bipolar disorder, hearing loss, and other problems. Serious noise exposure may lead to permanent hearing disorders (The Noise Control Network of the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan, 2018; Civil Aviation Authority, 2019; Peters et al., 2018). Therefore, aircraft noise causes inconvenience to residents and thus is a key topic for national aviation policies. Taiwan's government has established nighttime curfews and noise restrictions as well as welfare subsidies for residents near airports.====Taoyuan International Airport is currently Taiwan's largest airport. In 2017, its airport cargo throughput was 2,269,585 metric tons, accounting for 93.94% of the total cargo throughput of all airports in Taiwan. Its passenger throughput was 44,878,703, accounting for 68.02% of Taiwan's total airport passenger throughput (Data Query Network of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, 2019). Its passenger throughput ranks 36th in the world and has the 11th highest cargo throughput (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 2016). The second-largest airport in Taiwan is Kaohsiung International Air Station (hereafter referred to as Kaohsiung Airport). The total throughput of the airport in 2017 was 81,555 metric tons. Its passenger throughput was 6,479,183, accounting for 9.82% of Taiwan's total airport passenger throughput. The Kaohsiung Airport is adjacent to Kaohsiung City and is the largest airport in South Taiwan. In 2017, the number of takeoff and landing flights at Taoyuan Airport reached 674 per day and that at Kaohsiung International Airport reached 142 per day. Airport noise causes discomfort and even public grievances among nearby residents.====Airport risk assessment and management processes in managing pollution is a public health concern. Conflicts occur when the risk perceptions of the public differ from those of experts in government agencies. Environmental risk management can be improved by including the concerns of local residents. Risk management processes should be transparent to reduce public's threat perception. Risk perceptions are conceptually crucial in analyzing how people understand and avoid threats (Johnston et al., 1999). Hence, introducing public risk perceptions and risk communication to airport environmental risk management is vital for improving relations among local residents, governments, and airport operators.====Studies have investigated topics such as aircraft noise and health effects (Civil Aviation Authority, 2019; Peters et al., 2018), economic issues related to the costs and benefits of aircraft noise (He et al., 2014; Wolfe et al., 2016), the effect of aircraft noise on property values and management (Lijesen et al., 2010; Suksmith and Nitivattananon, 2015; Trojanek and Huderek-Glapska, 2018), noise control for residents (Asensio et al., 2014; Vogiatzis, 2012), and aircraft noise charge schemes (Lu, 2014). Only a few studies have discussed public perception and communication of aircraft noise risk (Jue et al., 1984; Gasco et al., 2017; Suau-Sanchez et al., 2011). Currently, no related research has been conducted in Taiwan. This study introduces the concept of risk perceptions and risk decisions to the risk assessment and management processes of Taoyuan and Kaohsiung International Airport. Introducing risk perception in the management process may improve relationships between local residents and port authorities and encourage local residents to react to aircraft noise pollution.====This study surveyed the aircraft noise opinions of residents living in areas surrounding Taoyuan and Kaohsiung airports. We analyzed the risk perceptions of noise pollution caused by aircraft taking off and landing and flight paths through residential areas and identified how local residents judge encountered noise risks. By using this survey, we obtained leading factors that can explain how local residents form their risk perceptions. Furthermore, this research explored the effect of risk perception on residents’ willingness to participate in risk management.

Based on the as-flown route structure learned, quantitative metrics are developed to describe the structural efficiency of the airspace and the operational efficiency of the traffic flows. For this, actual flight trajectories are projected onto reference nominal trajectories in space and time.

An interactive ==== tool is also created to output performance statistics and air traffic visualizations. With the provision of a systematic data-driven approach for characterizing actual air traffic operations, the analytics framework is envisioned to assist airspace design and performance monitoring processes and to provide the basis for developing predictive capabilities in support of traffic flow management.","As a key element of air transportation, Air Traffic Management (ATM) is the system of systems in charge of promoting a safe and orderly air traffic flow. Global air traffic has doubled in size once every 15 years since 1977 and is expected to continue to do so. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that the air traffic demand will double by 2035, reaching 7.2 billion passengers globally (International Air Transport Association, 2019). As aviation has evolved, technological and operational improvements for modernization of the ATM system have become necessary to enable the continued growth in air traffic while meeting increasingly stringent targets on efficiency, safety and environmental impact.====Besides the deployment of new technologies and operational procedures, efficient use of operational data is also key to improve ATM and increase the performance of air traffic operations. Every minute, a high volume of data is generated from the flight planning phase to the execution of the flight operation and will become increasingly available and accessible as the digital transformation of the ATM system takes place. Exploiting this big aviation data with advanced analytics techniques is a promising way for better assessing and predicting air traffic operational performance and developing new decision support tools for ATM.====Aircraft trajectory data is an example of operational data that has become increasingly accessible with new surveillance technologies. With Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), high-fidelity aircraft trajectory data is recorded and made available to the general public through online flight tracking services such as FlightRadar24 and FlightAware. Detailed analysis of flight trajectory data using advanced analytics techniques provides an opportunity for quantitatively assessing the air traffic performance at different dimensions and better understanding how this performance is affected by the various operational factors driving ATM decisions. From this knowledge, sources of inefficiencies can be addressed and new models and tools can be developed to better predict and control the performance of the system.====This paper presents a data-driven approach for multi-scale characterization of the as-flown route structure and air traffic flow efficiency in the Brazilian airspace based on aircraft tracking data recorded by surveillance systems. First, unsupervised learning is performed with a flight trajectory clustering analysis to identify air traffic patterns in both the terminal and the en route airspace for major origin-destination (OD) pairs of the Brazilian air transportation system. Based on the airspace structure learned, quantitative metrics are developed to describe the structural efficiency of the airspace and the operational spatiotemporal efficiency of the traffic flows at different scales. The usability of the data-driven approach is demonstrated with a comparative analysis of air traffic flow performance for multiple OD pairs in the Brazilian network across different flight phases and with the development of a statistical model to investigate causal factors for inefficiencies observed in the system. Finally, we also demonstrate the development of an interactive prototype tool for historical analysis and monitoring of air traffic performance created upon the trajectory data analytics framework.",Characterizing the Brazilian airspace structure and air traffic performance via trajectory data analytics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719306349,17 March 2020,2020,Research Article,387.0

This article proposes novel exact integer linear programming formulations for implementing first-in-first-out queue discipline, controlling waiting time and determining variable counter allocation with adjacency constraints for real world problems. Exact formulations in the existing literature handle small problems but do not address queue discipline and explicit control of waiting time. With our formulations, we solved live problems huge in size compared to those reported in the literature. The solutions are very efficient with passenger waiting times well below the international norms and high counter utilization.","Check-in counter allocation is an important problem, particularly at large airports. Airlines plan flight departures on a seasonal basis using weekly rosters, each season comprising about six months, and submit their plans to the airport operator for facilities. The airport operator explores the possibility of accommodating airlines’ requests considering available resources at the airport and makes commitments to the airlines for the entire season. In order to make seasonal commitments, the airport operator studies optimal utilization of resources at macro level. One of the important resources is check-in counters. This article is concerned with finding solutions to the check-in counter allocation problem primarily at the planning stage. Modelling this problem to find implementable solutions is difficult and challenging. A number of authors have studied this problem using Operations Research (OR) and Simulation tools (Chun and Mak, 1999, Atkins et al., 2003, Dijk and Sluis, 2006, Bruno and Genovese, 2010, Araujo and Repolho, 2015, Trakoonsanti, 2016, Bruno et al., 2018 etc).====At present, there are no exact formulations available for controlling waiting time theoretically and implementing queue disciplines.

To this end, suitable metrics are required to assess the role of the interconnections between the elements and complex network science provides several network metrics to evaluate the network functioning. Here we focus on centrality and causality metrics measuring, respectively, the importance of a node and the propagation of disturbances along links. By investigating a dataset of US flights, we show that existing centrality and causality metrics are not suited to characterise the effect of delays in the system. We then propose generalisations of such metrics that we prove suited to ATM applications. Specifically, the new centrality is able to account for the temporal and multi-layer structure of ATM network, while the new causality metric focuses on the propagation of extreme events along the system.","The introduction of changes in the ATM system is often difficult due to the tight interdependencies that exists across the different systems, subsystems, and institutional frameworks. The full implications of changes on parts of the system are difficult to predict at system level.====At a time of increased traffic, the ATM system can improve its performance by being better tuned for flexibility. For example, understanding the coupling between flights helps to understand the margins embedded into the flight schedules designed by airlines and can lead to better knowledge of the coupling between stakeholders and processes.====Current monitoring of ATM performances are based on ==== indicators (KPIs) which are estimated considering different stakeholders. However, the interdependencies among the system elements are not adequately represented. Capturing these interdependencies is critical in order to understand the current system performances and how changes affect the relationship between the elements in the system. This can be mitigated with the use of network metrics (Zanin and Lillo, 2013) such as ==== and ====, which quantify the network connectivity and highlight the delay propagation patterns. Moreover, it is relevant to consider how system’s elements are connected and how their criticality to propagate delay and cost might be different from the perspective of different stakeholders (and in particular for flights and passengers) (Cook et al., 2012, Montlaur and Delgado, 2017).====The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we show that existing network metrics are not suitable to identify the effect of delays and missed connections in the functioning of the ATM system at a global and local level. Second, we propose new metrics which are tested on real traffic data and are designed to capture loss of airport centralities and to identify channels of disturbance propagation. By using suitable simulation models, these network metrics can be used to assess the effect of the introduction of new mechanisms (e.g. modifying the flight arrival coordination) on the ATM system.

The proposed scenario 2 demonstrated significantly reduced net greenhouse gas emissions (t CO","It has been reported that aviation emissions account for more than 2% of global CO==== emissions and projected CO==== emissions (Mt) from international aviation is expected to grow to more than three times by 2050 in comparison to 2018 (ICAO, 2016). Currently, international airports are typically designed with operational and economic efficiency as priorities (Boons et al., 2010). Thus, successful international airports are normally evaluated by indicators such as financial performance, number of flights and passengers traffic. In some countries like the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other local authorities can implement special regulations for airports, however typically these regulations are limited in scope (Monsalud et al., 2016). Only in the last decades has the aviation industry started considering the sustainability performance, gradually introducing aspects of environmental stewardship and social responsibility as important issues (Monsalud et al., 2016; SAGA, 2013). Waste management in airports is one of the critical environmental issues that require more attention (Li et al., 2003). Despite the fast growth of aviation in airports, less attention is generally paid to the solid waste management in comparison to noise, aircraft emissions and water consumption (Pitt and Smith, 2003a, Pitt and Smith, 2003b; Carvalho et al., 2013). As noted by Upham et al. (2003) non-regulated resource and waste outputs in airports are related to carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, public negotiations on emissions and associated limits can be achieved locally as environmental capacity targets. As a result, locally achieved environmental limits have functioned as sustainable capacity limits and targets for airports (Upham et al., 2003).====The waste management policy recommended by the Airport Council International (ACI) is to divert solid waste disposed in landfills (ACI Policy Handbook, 2018). This is expressed in the waste management hierarchy: avoid generating waste, reduce, reuse, recycle and finally dispose the lowest possible quantity. Generally speaking, the purpose of waste management is to reduce amount of waste being generated and its disposal cost. Typically, airports generate both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that need to be recycled, utilized for energy recovery, or disposed at landfills (US Federal Aviation Administration, 2013). The typical waste streams generated at airports according to the International Civil Aviation Organization are: municipal solid waste (terminal, tenant, airline, cargo waste), construction and demolition waste (C&D), compostable and biodegradable waste and hazardous & industrial waste (ICAO) (US Federal Aviation Administration, 2013; ICAO). According to Baxter et al. (2018b), waste generated by airlines at Kansai International Airport (Japan) accounted for 20% of the total airport waste. Considering that the choice of airlines is directly influenced by the level of service provided to passengers (Abeyratne, 2001), airports are continuously seeking to achieve further improvement of customer service by providing free newspapers, magazines and other amenities. As a result, such measures lead to an extra airport waste. In this regard, it was observed that only sorting and recycling of newspapers on aircrafts at Munich Airport (Germany) was enough to reduce the waste by half (Pitt and Smith, 2003b). Moreover, the new regulation adopted by German Waste Management and Product Recycling Act in 2012, has forced all products purchased by the Munich airport to satisfy environmental and economic requirements. In addition, continuous improvement of higher recycling rate was achieved by the strict separation of recoverable fractions with trained staff in six recycling stations located nearby airport. Moreover, logistics optimization measures were performed by minimizing container loads, shortening the transport paths in order to reduce the GHG emissions (Baxter et al., 2014).====Waste management in international airports is recognized as one of the key aspects in sustainability performance (Lam et al., 2018; Upham et al., 2003; Kilkis and Kilkis, 2016). In the study of Kilkiș and Kilkiș (2016), a benchmarking of airports was developed based on the sustainability ranking indexes. According to the authors, environmental management and biodiversity were found to be one of the five main drivers to build a ranking of sustainable airports. As expected, water and waste management aspects of airports also served as main indicators (Kilkiș and Kilkiș, 2016). In addition, the authors extended the study by implementing benchmarking metabolism further for airlines based on the sustainability airline index (SAI) (Kilkiș and Kilkiș, 2017). The results showed that top ranking airports such as Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Frankfurt and Munich (Germany), Atatürk (Turkey) and Heathrow (UK) have achieved a high level performance both in terms of operational aspects, such as passenger and cargo traffic, and environmental management. In addition, a comparison of world's best 10 top airports was also conducted by Koç and Durmaz (2015) based on sustainability analysis and performance. According to this study, the airport that perform very well according to the stakeholder expectations do not necessarily perform satisfactorily in terms of sustainability reporting investigations based on empirical findings (Koç and Durmaz, 2015).====According to the annual reports and open data Munich, Naples (Italy), Gatwick (UK), Hong Kong and Geneva (Switzerland) had the highest recycling rate of municipal solid wastes in recent years (Munich Airport 2015/2016; Miedico, 2018; Gatwick Airport, 2017; HKIA, 2016/17; Geneva Airport, 2018). In addition, Copenhagen (Denmark) and Brussels (Belgium) International Airports have achieved significant improvements in terms of waste recycling rate of around 26 and 28%, respectively (Copenhagen Airport, 2017; Brussels Airport, 2017). The detailed information on waste recycling rates of some selected international airports are presented in Table 1.====The total weight of the reclaimed solid waste at Munich Airport has continuously decreased from 16 000 to 8000 t from 2008 to 2011 (Baxter et al., 2014). In 2015, the airport achieved a solid waste recycling rate of 79%, 57% of which was mixed materials and 22% was waste paper. Of the non-recycled waste (21%), 11% was sent to a biogas plant, while the remaining 10% was disposed at the Munich landfill (Munich Airport, 2015). In 2016, 6.4 Mt of waste was recycled, while 4.5 Mt of waste was used for energy recovery purposes, and only 309 t was disposed at the landfill (Munich Airport, 2016). Approximately 10.4 kt of waste was generated in 2015 at Kansai International Airport (KIA, 2016) and 83% was characterized as combustible fraction and the remaining 17% as recyclable fractions (KIA, 2016). The combustible fraction includes kitchen, food, rags, non-recycle and other wastes, while the non-combustible fraction consist of glass, ceramic dishes, glass bottles (broken) and metal wastes. The recyclable fraction of KIA airport is further sorted to aluminum, steel cans, unbroken glass bottles, newspaper, magazines, office paper, documents and cardboard (KIA, 2016). The combustible fractions were utilized at the incineration plant located at the Kansai Airport area. The incineration plant is equipped with a fluidized bed combustion system. Flue gas from the incinerator is treated with a filter-type precipitator, catalysis to reduce NOx emissions and wet ash stabilization technology (Baxter et al., 2018a, Baxter et al., 2018b). The exhaust gas from the incinerator is controlled under strict standards limits and kept at or below the following concentrations: dust at 0.02 g/Nm====, SOx at 20 ppm, HCl at 30 ppm and NOx at 70 ppm (Baxter et al., 2018a, Baxter et al., 2018b).====As is evident, there are only a few studies on solid waste management in international airports (Pitt and Smith, 2003b, Pitt and Smith, 2003a; Mayer et al., 2015; Baxter et al., 2018a, Baxter et al., 2018b). As the first step in any waste management plan for the Astana International Airport, the detailed composition of MSW produced at the airport (TSE) is required and it is presented here for the first time. In addition to the compositional analysis, GHG emissions were estimated from the MSW fractions and four possible scenarios are evaluated. As experience has shown, the waste management scenarios could potentially reduce the environmental footprint of the airport. At present no recycling program or other waste management measures are implemented in the Astana International Airport. Also, there are limited data on MSW management for any international airports in Kazakhstan. This study will be useful for airport as well as city authorities to develop an effective solid waste management strategy and also to promote continuous improvement of existing waste management programs.",Municipal solid waste management and greenhouse gas emissions at international airports: A case study of Astana International Airport,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301644,11 March 2020,2020,Research Article,390.0

At the same time, decision-making about airport capacity investments is extremely complex, involving trade-offs. This paper’s objective is to optimise a privately owned airport system’s capacity investment decision in a city under demand uncertainty. Next to the investment size, our real options model incorporates the timing of the investment, as well as the cost of congestion. The results reveal that the larger a city’s initial airport capacity, the smaller its investment will relatively be and the lower the occupancy rate threshold at which investment will take place. We also show that, in case of a higher demand growth combined with more demand uncertainty, the city will benefit from a significantly larger investment, but made later at a higher occupancy rate. In this case, cities with a small initial capacity will sometimes even more than double current capacity. Higher airport charges and an increase in non-aeronautical revenues both lead to a later investment in more capacity, due to the increased project attractiveness. An increase in congestion costs results in a larger investment made earlier, in order to eliminate delays. Airport operational cost and capacity holding cost increases both lead to smaller investments.","Airbus (2017), Boeing (2017) and IATA (2017) expect passenger as well as air cargo traffic to double over the next 20 years. This will put pressure on the entire sector to maintain its level of operational readiness within the boundaries of safety, environmental standards and cost-effectiveness. Consequently, airport capacity shortage is one of today’s major challenges in the aviation sector. According to Eurocontrol (2013), 1.9 million flights or 12% of demand will not be accommodated in 2035 due to an imbalance between demand and capacity, resulting in airport congestion and delays. Furthermore, insufficient capacity leads to higher air fares and thus a negative impact on consumer welfare (Zou and Hansen, 2012, SEO Amsterdam Economics, 2017).====In order to safeguard future economic growth, existing airport capacity should be used more efficiently and investments in new airport capacity are indispensable. However, airport capacity investment decision-making is confronted with a lot of uncertainty and trade-offs. First of all, the demand for air transport, which is a derived demand linked to economic fluctuations, is highly cyclical. Second, airport capacity expansion is lumpy and involves long lead times. This increases the exposure to uncertainty and financial risk. Third, similar to other transport infrastructure projects, airport capacity expansion involves a fundamental trade-off between economic and environmental objectives. On the one hand, connectivity has measurable economic value for a region. On the other hand, expansion leads to a negative impact on the environment in terms of e.g., noise, local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Fourth, a trade-off in airport capacity investment decisions exists between overinvestment in order to avoid costly delays but at the expense of potentially underutilised infrastructure at a high investment cost and underinvestment leading to congestion but at a lower investment cost. Finally, different stakeholders are involved in airport infrastructure investments. Peneda et al. (2011) distinguish five groups of stakeholders among which different interactions exist, namely politicians, the airport operator, airport users, non-users and investors. These stakeholders often have conflicting objectives. As indicated by Smit (2003), the shareholder value of an airport differs from its societal value. This is also why decision-making about airport infrastructure investment depends on the airport ownership structure. Privately owned airports have the objective to maximise profits, whereas publicly owned airports will focus on social welfare maximisation, including consumer surplus, spillover benefits and airline profits.====It is clear that the questions whether, when and to what extent to expand existing airport capacity will become increasingly relevant. They are however very challenging to answer. London, where it took almost 50 years of debates and studies before an expansion decision was made, is one of the most illustrative examples of the complexity of airport capacity investment decision-making. However, airport capacity planning is not only relevant for mega-cities with hubs, such as London with around one million annual aircraft movements in the entire city (Department for Transport, 2017). It also matters for smaller airport cities such as Brussels with about 200 000 annual flight movements.====The objective of this paper is to optimise large-scale and irreversible airport capacity investment decisions of cities with existing airport capacity in terms of both the flexible amount and timing of the investment. In order to accurately take this managerial flexibility to deal with uncertainty into account, a real options approach is adopted. This approach is well-suited to deal with large, expensive and irreversible infrastructure investments, such as runways, terminals and towers, under uncertainty. Our research fills a gap in the existing literature in two ways. First, previous airport capacity investment studies accounting for demand uncertainty do not consider flexible investment timing. In this paper, both the timing and the size of a one-shot, once-and-for-all investment in airport capacity expansion are optimised together. Second, while congestion is not explicitly modelled in previous studies dealing with infrastructure investments under demand uncertainty, it is incorporated in our model using a realistic approach based on insights from queuing theory. The link between capacity and congestion leading to delays is important and has been studied for many years (Newell, 1979, Zhang and Zhang, 2006). Next to making two contributions to the scientific literature on both airport capacity investment and real options modelling, this research presents insights to improve aviation policy-making as well as airport operators’, users’ and investors’ decisions.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the existing research in the field of airport infrastructure investments. Our model is introduced in Section 3, while Section 4 describes the selection of model parameter values. The optimal investment decision calculations using real options theory are carried out in Section 5. Section 6 is dedicated to the interpretation and discussion of the results.

Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) which is the most widely used in literature is one of these models. HFACS is based on Reason's Swiss Cheese Model. The biggest disadvantage of the Reason's model is its post-accident applicability. Mostly HFACS aviation applications are usually based on accident data. This is a reagent (result-focused) approach. In this study, however, HFACS which is an improved version of Reason's model, was applied to aircraft incidents that did not result in an accident. This is a proactive approach. Thus, with this approach, the biggest disadvantage of Reason's model is turned into an advantage. In addition, a realistic application of this approach has been demonstrated in this study, focusing on aircraft incidents that took place between 2000 and 2018. The year 2000 forms a milestone in the manufacture of more technically advanced aircraft models which significantly reduced occurrence of technical errors in aircrafts, hence the choice of 2000 as base year. A total of 328 aircraft incident reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database were studied and among these reports cockpit crew related incidents were analyzed using HFACS. As a result of the analyzes, the root causes of incidents have been identified. In addition, unlike traditional HFACS analysis, the relationship between errors occurred at management levels of HFACS and the unsafe acts of the cockpit crew in aircraft incidents was statistically revealed.","During the analysis of an aircraft accident or incident, if the cause is a technical factor, it can be detected based on the data obtained from flight data recorder, voice recorder or from other sources with certain tests (fatigue test etc.). These causes can be entered into the accident or incident database in a well-defined way. For example; pilot tube malfunction or engine failure. This facilitates the work of aviation authorities to ensure that post-accident database analyzes are carried out in a methodical way. However, if the accident or incident was caused by human factors, it will be more difficult to find out the exact cause, in this case, the analysis of the accident or incident will be more intuitive rather than data-based. Moreover, it would have been impossible to make advanced tests as in the case of mechanical failures. In addition, the expressions entered into the accident database will not be well defined. As a result, this will not provide useful, convenient, data for aviation authorities when performing subsequent data analysis (Shappell and Wiegmann, 2003). For all the above reasons, a comprehensive framework is needed to analyze human factors. If all analyzes are carried out using an advanced framework, the expressions entered in the database will be well defined and useful. The Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) was developed by Shappell and Wiegmann to meet this need (Wiegmann and Shappell, 2001b).",The effect of management practices on aircraft incidents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718304460,24 February 2020,2020,Research Article,392.0

The results confirm that the travelers' WTP for the premium economy class in the long-haul travel is higher than those in the medium and the short-haul travels. However, the ratio of additional WTP to the economy class fare in the long-haul route is slightly lower than that in the medium-haul route. The results also present that international travelers have the highest WTP for increased seat width in the premium economy class service attribute, followed by increased seat pitch and upgraded in-flight meal service. Finally, the results indicate that the WTP to upgrade to premium economy class are proportional to the age or the income level of travelers. Furthermore, international travel frequency and the experience of premium economy class have a positive impact as well. This research can be a useful resource for analyzing international travelers’ WTP concerning the type of service and this information will be useful to policy makers in their efforts to determine their fare policies and the target audience for marketing premium economy class.","The premium economy class is fast becoming an embedded and valued product, and it targets the price sensitive business traveler and the comfort seeking leisure passenger. Since Virgin Atlantic and EVA Air introduced the first premium economy class in 1992, 6 airlines operated in 2000, 14 airlines operated in 2009, 48 airlines operated in 2015 and over 60 airlines are now operating the premium economy class in the world. After the 2008 global economic crisis, many passengers who previously traveled in business class downgraded to economy class, and some carriers expedited the introduction of the premium economy cabin to sustain a higher yield. Furthermore, there are many leisure travelers who are unwilling to pay for business class, but would be prepared to incur the additional charges to upgrade to premium economy class (Hugon-Duprat and O'Connell, 2015).====The premium economy class is positioned between economy class and business class in terms of fare, comfort, etc. It is sometimes limited to more leg room, but its most comprehensive service can be associated with business class. Each airline operating the premium economy class provides different seat space and additional service properties. Table 1 shows the comprehensive list of carriers and service routes operating the premium economy class from/to Incheon International Airport in Korea as of May 2017.====For the successful introduction of the premium economy class, a careful study of the additional costs involved and reasonable tariffs are needed. Thus, this study aims to investigate how much international travelers are willing to pay to upgrade from economy to premium economy class by service type and to identify the socioeconomic and travel characteristics of international travelers that affect the additional willingness-to-pay (WTP) for upgrading to premium economy class. In particular, all the domestic flights in Korea have less than 1 h of boarding time, so all the carriers operating domestic flights do not consider the introduction of premium economy class. In this background, we investigate the WTP for international travelers explicitly. Also, we use the Tobit model which is superior to the regression discontinuity and quantile regression model because the WTP includes positive and zero responses, and it is assumed to be censored at zero.",Estimation of willingness-to-pay for premium economy class by type of service,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719303783,22 February 2020,2020,Research Article,393.0

Of the various drone applications, delivery services for commercial goods or emergency medical supplies are currently being tested and implemented such as Amazon (Amazon and Amazon prime air, 2018), Alibaba (The Economic Times, 2017), and the DPD group in France (La Poste Group Press Department, 2016). They are expected to become a prominent drone application.====Much attention has been given to drone delivery service, but there is still little officially launched service due to regulatory and technical issues. Most countries have legal restrictions preventing drones from flying beyond visual line of sight or from flying automatically without a pilot, which makes it difficult for drone delivery service to begin in earnest, but their use will increase over the long term. As battery, propulsion, and communication technologies evolve, long-distance and long-term flight becomes possible and the marketability of drone delivery service is expected to improve as a result.====As such, this study assumes that drones will be widely used in the near future, especially for the delivery of consumer goods. For example, Amazon Prime Air will deliver small packages to customers in 30 min or less (Amazon and Amazon prime air, 2018). However, there has been a lack of research on consumer preference for the drone delivery service. Unlike traditional freight transport, of which the mode is determined by shippers such as logistics manager (Tavasszy and De Jong, 2013), receivers (i.e., consumers) can choose the mode of delivery for consumer goods. Online shopping malls in Korea, for instance, provide delivery options (e.g., by truck or motorcycle) to consumers, and consumers make a decision based on the speed and price of delivery. Indeed, some consumers are willing to pay more for the same-day shipping, then they choose the motorcycle delivery. As such, consumers will be aware of and choose the mode of delivery such as drone delivery when online retailers launch drone delivery service. Recall that some online retailers such as Amazon have already been advertising their upcoming new delivery option (i.e., drone) to potential customers. Hence, the choice behavior analysis in this new context is necessary.====The market share of drone delivery service can be estimated with the knowledge on preference, so it is essential for the decision of whether or not to enter the new market enabled by drones. Therefore, this study contributes to analyze potential consumer preference for drone delivery service based on the analysis of mode choice behavior among traditional and new delivery services. Although the underlying choice model is well known and widely implemented, this is the first study to propose such an analysis, and the results of this study will raise awareness of a new era in end-user delivery service. The proposed model considers not only traditional parcel delivery by trucks but also the delivery service by motorcycle, which is not widely used outside of Korea. The findings of this study will provide a reasonable estimation of the future market share of drone delivery services, so it will be useful for parcel delivery companies preparing to deploy drones in a new market.",Choice model based analysis of consumer preference for drone delivery service,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719304661,19 February 2020,2020,Research Article,394.0

Airport parking, which is a substantial source of revenue for the airports, is no different and anecdotal evidence suggest a reduction in parking revenue in airports in recent years as a result of the popularity of ride-hailing services. This research investigates the effects of the entry of ride-hailing services on airport parking patronage using three large airports (John F Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International and LaGuardia) in the US as a case study. Intervention analysis technique was used on time-series monthly parking data at these airports, controlling for passenger numbers. Results indicate there was a statistically significant reduction in the numbers of cars parked at all three airports since the introduction of ride-hailing services, confirming the anecdotal evidence. Findings have implications not only for airport business and revenue models, but also for wider effects of ride-hailing and automation.","The ride-sourcing or ride-hailing services provided by the Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber, Lyft, Didi-Chuxing, Ola or Grab have gained rapid popularity among the global urban population, both in the developed and the developing countries. These on-demand mobility services use advanced information and communication technology based smart-phone applications to dynamically and efficiently connect drivers to consumers in real time (Shaheen et al., 2015). Unlike the traditional taxi services, often the drivers use their own vehicles to provide the service and are directly responsible for the capital and running costs of the vehicles. These services often operate under a more lax regulatory environment than taxis and pass on a substantial burden of the risk to the drivers, allowing them to be significantly cheaper than taxis in most places. The use of mobile phone applications with real-time and visual tracking of the vehicle and the absence of cash transactions (in some developing countries, cash can be used) make the TNC services convenient for the passengers too. The potential introduction of fully automated vehicles is expected to reduce the costs of these on-demand mobility services even further in future, with the possibility of a substantial switch from vehicle ownership to these on-demand mobility services. This has large implications on how we travel in future and consequently on energy use, carbon emissions, land use pattern and distributional equity. One lens through which potential impacts of vehicle automation could be understood is through studying the effects of ride-hailing services.====Even without automation, ride-hailing services are significantly changing the urban travel pattern (Henao and Marshall, 2018; Clewlow and Mishra, 2017; Schaller Consulting, 2018; San Francisco County Transportation Authority, 2018). One area where ride-hailing services can have a profound impact on is the land-use, especially through reducing parking needs and potential repurposing of parking spaces in urban areas. Anecdotal evidence suggest that parking revenue in urban areas has been declining due to the emergence of the TNCs (Moris, 2018). A recent survey among the parking professionals reveal that ride-hailing services are the largest driver of changes in car parking behaviour (International Parking Institute, 2018).====Outside of traditional parking-centric businesses, parking plays a substantial role in the airport business. Parking is a large source of revenue for the airports, and often the largest non-aviation related source. Median gross parking revenues were USD 63 Million and USD 23 Million in large and medium hub airports in the US in 2016 (Mandle et al., 2017), while in London Heathrow Airport (LHR), parking revenue was GBP 107 Million in 2015 (Steer Davies Gleave, 2017). In San Francisco International Airport (SFO), parking and ground transportation account for around 14% of the operating revenue (Airport Commission, 2018), while the share is 16% for LHR (Steer Davies Gleave, 2017). On the other hand, the use of TNC services for airport access has grown rapidly: at SFO, the use of ridehailing services increased by 59% between July 2016 and June 2017. While most of this growth came at the expense of commercial surface transport (primarily traditional taxis), there were substantial reduction (7.9%) in parking during that period, too. Such large reductions in parking transactions due to the operations of TNC services can cause significant concern for airport operators. However, apart from Henao et al. (2018), all of the evidence on the impact of these on-demand mobility services on airport parking are from the grey literature: there is little information on the background data (often using confidential commercial data that researchers do not have access to) or on the adequacy and robustness of the methods, making them less transparent to scrutiny. As such, this research aims to model the effects of ride-hailing services on airport parking using publicly available time-series parking data from three large airports in the US serving New York City: John F Kennedy International (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA) and Newark Liberty International (EWR). Unlike the previous scant literature on the topic, focus is on developing robust time-series models to understand the impacts.====The paper is organised as follows.

Thus, in the presence of higher airfares due to a subsidy, the tourists not entitled to the subsidy have incentives to switch to a cheaper alternative, namely tourism packages. Consequently, a packaging strategy can lessen or even avoid the negative impacts of the subsidy on a region's tourism sector.","Airfare subsidies have been introduced in some territories despite international aviation law and regulations advocating free air transport markets (e.g. Billete de Villemeur, 2004; Fu et al., 2010). As stated by Valido et al. (2014), such policy measures can be only justified by the presence of market failures or for equity reasons. As highlighted by these authors, the so-called outermost regions of the European Union (EU) constitute a paradigmatic case in this respect. These regions are overseas territories whose residents, as an exception to the European legislation, receive subsidies on airfares when travelling to the rest of their country. It goes without saying that traveling from (to) a remote region to (from) the rest of the country relies mainly on air transport, particularly when these territories are islands, so these subsidies aim to compensate the disadvantages due to remoteness that are not endured by other national citizens.====However, airfare subsidies for residents may have undesirable effects linked to possible airfare price rises that might have a crowding-out effect of passengers who are not entitled to the subsidy. These concerns have given rise to a number of empirical and theoretical research studies. For instance, Fageda et al. (2016) analysed the impacts on airfares of subsidies introduced in Spain during the period 2003-2013, while the theoretical work of Valido et al. (2014) studied the inefficiencies generated by such subsidies, as non-resident passengers may be expelled from the market.====Previous studies have focused on the effects of subsidies on air transport markets and leave aside the analysis of other economic impacts on remote regions. Importantly, some impacts might become an issue if their economies are mostly based on tourism (Bråthen and Halpern, 2012). Indeed, airfare subsidies may lead to a significant expansion of transport demand by residents to visit the rest of the country, thus causing a rise in the prices of airline tickets for subsidised air routes. As a consequence, tourism flows from the rest of the country might be reduced, cutting down the rents earned by the remote region's tourism sector.====The Spanish tourism region of the Canary Islands is a prototypical case in this respect. This archipelago is an outermost region of the EU, where the tourism sector amounted to 35.2% of GDP and 40.3% of employment in 2017 (Exceltur and de Canarias, 2018). In 2018, the Spanish government raised the ad-valorem subsidy for archipelago residents from 50% to 75% of the market airfare.==== Thus, these subsidies involve a difference between the reduced airfares paid by residents and the market airfares earned by airlines. More specifically, residents only pay 25% of market airfares, while the national government pays the remainder 75% to the airlines. This large increase in the subsidy could well have sizeable impacts on the regional tourism industry. This calls for an in-depth analysis in order to identify potential adverse effects and policy measures or firms’ strategies to manage them. For this purpose, this paper studies the effects of an ad-valorem subsidy for residents on the performance of another sector, namely the tourism industry, which produces complementary services. More specifically, we explore how a packaging strategy – widely used in the tourism sector – results in hidden price discrimination that benefits both transport and local tourism firms. To our knowledge, no previous attempt has been made in this direction.====Our analysis involves not only the transport price on the air route connecting the region with the rest of the country, but also the price of tourism services supplied in the region. Note that the price of local tourism services is also affected by international tourists coming from the rest of the world. Therefore, an additional price must be taken into account, namely, the transport price for the air route that connects the region with the rest of the world.====It is important to highlight that the tourism demand from the rest of the country tends to represent a significant share in this kind of remote destination. In the case of islands and other remote regions of the EU the share of nationals in tourism demand - share of country residents in overnight stays in tourism accommodation - ranges from around 10% in the case of the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Madeira and Islands of the Aegean and Crete; 14% in Ionian Islands; 43% in Azores; and between 50% and 86% in Corsica, Sardinia and French Overseas Departments (Eurostat, 2019). Moreover, literature has shown that tourism flows to island regions from mainland countries are mainly determined by income in the origin regions of tourists and prices of flight tickets (Gundelfinger-Casar and Coto-Millán, 2018). Consequently, rises in air prices due to airfare subsidies for residents could greatly affect tourism flows from the rest of the country.====The impact of airfare subsidies for residents on the regional tourism sector seems to rely on the transport firms’ ability to discriminate prices between passengers who are eligible for subsidies, i.e. residents, and passengers who are not. However, this type of price discrimination is forbidden by law (Vissers et al., 2014; Borgesius and Poort, 2017). This prohibition suggests that a rise in the transport price could greatly reduce the flows of incoming passengers from the rest of the nation, with the consequent contraction in the tourism production and profits earned by the tourism sector in the remote region. Nevertheless, here we highlight that, in the case of tourism, there exists the possibility of hidden price discrimination (Magenheim and Murrell, 1988) through packaging. Indeed, packaging is a distinctive practice in tourism markets and involves the sale of bundles or tourism packages that contain the typical services of a tourism shopping basket. This basket is mainly composed of air transport and accommodation services, but it can also include rental cars, excursions and other recreational activities supplied in the destination (e.g. Wong and Kwong, 2004; Čavlek, 2006; Zhang et al., 2009; Romero and Tejada, 2011; Calveras and Orfila, 2010, 2014, Calveras and Orfila-Sintes, 2019). By packaging transport and destination tourism services, non-residents may purchase a package for an overall price, in which airfares are not observable. In this way, non-residents can opt for either buying directly from firms, thus facing a stand-alone price for each service, or purchasing the tourism package sold at a discounted price. In other words, firms sell services within a tourism package at a lower price than when selling them directly to clients. Consequently, in the presence of higher airfares because of an airfare subsidy for residents, non-residents may have more incentives to buy tourism packages than each service separately. The issue is, then, to what extent this hidden price discrimination, which causes a switch from direct selling to packaging, could alleviate or even prevent a possible contraction of tourism production and profits due to the subsidy.====To answer this question, we develop a theoretical model that represents air transport and tourism transactions involving a remote region, the rest of the country and the rest of the world. We consider two air routes: a national air route, used by passengers with residence in the remote region and national passengers from the rest of the country; and a foreign air route, used by foreign passengers to reach the remote region. Noticeably, air transport and tourism services provided in the destination are complementary goods (e.g. Divisekera, 2002; Álvarez-Albelo and Hernández-Martín, 2012; Wachsman, 2006; Álvarez-Albelo et al., 2017), though not necessarily perfect complements. The reason lies in the fact that the purpose of the trip for some passengers could be to visit friends or relatives, and hence not all air passengers will demand tourism services at the destination. Moreover, residents do not need to buy air tickets to consume the tourism services supplied in the region. However, inbound holiday tourists typically demand both air transport and tourism services. Indeed, owing to their specific characteristics, some holiday tourists would be interested in purchasing these services jointly as a bundle or tourism package (e.g. Sheldon and Mak, 1987; Yoon and Shafer, 1997; Pearce, 2008), provided that the package is offered at a discount price, that is to say, at a price lower than buying the services separately.====As in Valido et al. (2014) and Forsyth and Dwyer (2002), we consider that air transport and tourism markets operate under imperfect competition, namely, firms have market power. For the sake of simplicity, in the model, we assume that each air route is operated by a different monopolist firm, and the tourism services are also provided by a monopolist firm based in the region. Firms can sell their services directly to their clients (direct selling) and jointly as a tourism package (bundling). In the latter case, each transport firm and the tourism firm undertake a packaging strategy or policy that creates additional demand for tourism packages and results in lower joint prices. The package prices are determined through mutually beneficial agreements between firms, which are reflected in revenue sharing contracts (e.g. Wang et al., 2004; Giannoccaro and Pontrandolfo, 2004; Cachon and Lariviere, 2005; Guo and He, 2012). Thus, the firms agree upon the package prices and the share of joint profits from sales. Competition à la Bertrand between each transport firm and tourism firm determines the stand-alone prices for the respective services.====Therefore, the model contains both stand-alone prices from direct selling and the prices of tourism packages from the packaging policy. In this setting, the airfare subsidy for residents can cause the stand-alone ticket price on the national air route to rise. In this scenario, passenger flows from the rest of the nation will be reduced, diminishing the production and profits of the tourism firm based in the region. Even so, these adverse effects might be compensated by an increase in incoming tourists attracted by a higher price discount linked to the packaging strategy. Consequently, the net impact on the region's tourism sector relies on the opposing effects of the subsidy on the demand segment of direct selling and the demand segment of tourism packages.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 offers a review of related literature. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4 solves for stand-alone and package prices in equilibrium. Sections 5 shows the impacts of a higher ad-valorem subsidy on air transport and tourism markets. Section 6 discusses the results. Lastly, section 7 summarises and concludes.",The effects on tourism of airfare subsidies for residents: The key role of packaging strategies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719304806,12 February 2020,2020,Research Article,397.0

The impediments challenging financial prosperity in the continent are numerous and have resulted in prolonged loss-making periods across most Latin American carriers. Breaking with this trend, Copa Airlines has been able to report double-digit net results for several years and recorded 56% of total profits earned by all Latin American carriers in 2016. This research has identified a number of Key Performance Indicators that have underpinned Copa Airlines' financial prosperity through a Product and Organisational Architecture (POA) framework analysis whose results were validated and elaborated upon by the CEO of Copa Airlines. Copa's sustained financial success was attributable to a number of factors. First, its geographical positioning has allowed it to engineer strong connectivity by coupling North and South America through its hub, which is reachable with narrowbodies to nearly all points in the Americas. Second, its low unit cost structure is akin to that of LCCs, operating a single aircraft type with high utilisation. Third, it has a uniquely low market concentration of competitors on its routes and capitalises on this by having a strong schedule with high frequencies together with outstanding punctuality. Fourth, it has a synergistic and fruitful cooperation with its hub airport at Tocumen. Finally it benefits from positive external factors such as a dollarized home economy with high GDP growth, exceptionally low unemployment and ==== rates ring-fenced with security. These pillars can be used as a reference for other Latin based airlines seeking to improve profitability.","Latin America is comprised of nineteen sovereign states and the continent is a cluster of several heterogeneous operating environments. The region comprises 13% of the world's landmass, but only accounts for 5.2% of the global air passenger market, a significantly lower share when compared to Europe and the US with 26% and 24% respectively (IATA, 2018; World Bank, 2017). However airfares have fallen by more than 50% since 2002 and passenger numbers have trebled, while passenger demand in the region is forecasted to grow from 298 million in 2015 to 658 million by 2035 (ALTA, 2016). The annual travel rate per capita for Latin America is less than 1%, but the region has great potential for growth with a burgeoning middle class with higher disposable incomes encircled by an amplifying economic outlook, while the fleet is expected to more than double over the next 20 years to almost 4,500 aircraft (Ascend, 2018; CAPA, 2017; Euromonitor, 2017). The FAA (2016) reinforced the magnitude of Latin America by reporting that it remains the largest international destination for US carriers.====However airline profitability remains elusive and problematic in Latin America as it is constantly hindered by numerous challenges including: high operating costs; weak yields; very high airport charges; navigation taxes; strict and burdensome government regulations; restrictive, outdated or non-existent air service agreements; and an inefficient and outdated aviation infrastructure. As a consequence Latin American carriers continue to underperform financially. Over a 6 year period from 2011 to 2016, Latin American carriers averaged net losses of $900,000 while in 2016 they produced an average of $600,000 in profits, representing just 3% of global net profits of $34.8 billion, while their counterparts in North America accounted for over 47% of net profits (IATA WATS, 2017; IATA WATS, 2014). In 2016, Latin American carriers earned just $2.15 net profit per passenger, while industry-wide airlines averaged $9.13 – more than 4 times that of Latin America (IATA WATS, 2017). The situation has not changed over the decades as Cooper et al. (1995) conducted a Delphi study in the early 1990s of Latin American airlines whose respondents rated ‘generating profits’ as a low priority. However, within the quagmire of underperforming Latin American carriers, Copa Airlines has been a shining star as it has attained financial prosperity combined with superior operational efficiency for sustained periods whilst operating in the continent's difficult environment. Noteworthy is that Copa Airlines' profits comprised around 56% of total profits earned by Latin American carriers in 2016, while it produced the world's 3rd strongest operating margin in 2017, registering 18% as well as the world's 3rd best net margin of 15%. In Q1 2018, it attained the world's highest operating and net margin of 20% and 19% respectively (Flightglobal, 2018; Airline Weekly, 2018). For most of the last decade it generated double-digit operating and net margins. This unprecedented and sustained profitability of a Latin American airline merited deeper investigation to uncover its differentiated strategies that underpin its prosperity in such a difficult geographical setting. The aim of this paper is to outline the key strategic drivers that underpin Copa Airlines' financial prosperity when compared with the remaining dominant carriers on the continent.====The findings may provide a blueprint of recommendations for other airlines operating in Latin America to improve their profitability. The objectives of the paper are three fold. First, to understand the Latin American air transport market by outlining the challenges and to categorise market concentration levels of the continent's seat capacity. Second, to pinpoint which elements of Copa Airlines' business model contributes to its continued profitability, when benchmarked against the remaining dominant carriers in Latin America and third, to provide supporting empirical evidence on each of the elements that positively contributes to Copa Airlines' profitability as corroborated by its CEO.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 defines the current situation in the Latin American market. Section 3 outlines the research methodology. Section 4 presents the results from the Pareto Analysis and Product and Organisational Architecture (POA) framework pinpointing the characteristics that specifically contribute to Copa Airlines' prolonged profitability. Section 5 outlines the specific elements that have contributed to Copa's financial prosperity, which were validated by its CEO.

Its technical development and service achievements make it one of the most significant contributors to the advancement of modern society. The demand for air transport has steadily increased over the years, influencing global economy. Furthermore, it has enabled the rapid movement of millions of persons around the world and improved quality of life (ICAO, 2004). In this context, assuring that air passengers services maintain high-quality standards becomes fundamental. This objective is attainable only by analysing service quality from the passengers' point-of-view, in order to recognize passengers' opinions and identify critical issues and consequently, adopt strategies to improve passenger services. Providing high-quality services to business and tourist passengers is a core competitive advantage to reach relevant economic development (Chen, 2008). Travellers would be certainly more attracted by more modern airport infrastructures, and by more comfortable and safer airlines; therefore, measuring customer satisfaction is a key element for airlines'survival and competitiveness (Tsafarakis et al., 2017). In the case of the airport infrastructures it is particularly useful for managing companies to identify the most suitable policy strategies to improve the provided services.====The main contribution of this paper is to propose a model that best captures the differences in the opinions of air transport passengers and that is able to identify groups of passengers with similar perceptions about the services. This differentiation can be useful to better understand specific passengers’ requirements as a function of their characteristics, and consequently to undertake more targeted intervention for improving the services. We decided to propose a model structure based on SEM-MIMIC approach, which we hold as the most suitable instrument for our research objectives, specifically to capture heterogeneity in the perceptions.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: a section of literature review; a specific section concerning the SEM-MIMIC methodological approach, specifically the ordinal Probit framework; a section dedicated to the case study supporting the work; a section describing the results of the proposed model, and finally a section discussing the results and the conclusions about the work.","Service quality in a mid-sized air terminal: A SEM-MIMIC ordinal probit accounting for travel, sociodemographic, and user-type heterogeneity",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719303916,3 February 2020,2020,Research Article,399.0

Statistical inference is also performed on the GMPI results using the bootstrapping method. Empirical research was conducted on 15 international airlines during 2011-2017. The obtained results showed that the productivity of all airlines had been fluctuating and experienced a slight increase over 2011–2017. Most of these 15 airlines made more progress in managing punctuality than CO==== emissions. High punctuality policy may not be the best choice for all airlines when considering financial constraints, while airlines in more liberalized aviation markets are more likely to improve productivity by reducing flight delays. Efficiency change and technological change were the major driving factors for the growth of airline productivity. European and US airlines benefitted more from superior technology, while most Asian and Oceanian airlines still benefitted from the advantage of efficiency. Based on the findings, specific management advice was given.","The international civil aviation industry has experienced rapid growth over the past few decades, boosted by a population boom and economic prosperity (Airbus, 2014). Inevitably, airline companies are faced with increasingly fierce competition. For instance, airlines have been granted more operational rights with less governmental control, the number of private airlines has increased, low-cost carriers have been booming, and an increasing number of airlines have entered international markets (Wanke et al., 2015). Airlines are devoted to improving their operational performance and pursuing greater competitiveness. Academics are aware of the necessity for appropriate airline performance evaluations and have extensively studied this topic (Wanke and Barros, 2016; Zou et al., 2014; Wing Chow, 2010). In addition to increasing desirable outputs which was highlighted in operational management, the undesirable outputs such as flight delays and CO==== emissions of an airline should further be reduced, in order to continually improve its productivity (Arjomandi and Seufert, 2014; Li et al., 2016; Tsionas et al., 2017).====With the increasing environmental and service quality awareness of customers, new challenges emerged for the majority of airlines. One of the environmental issues with the highest profile is the CO==== emissions of an airline. In 2016, flights worldwide produced 815 million tons of CO====, which accounts for 2% of all global man-made CO==== emissions (IATA, 2016). Although this is only a relatively low proportion, emissions from the civil aviation industry increased fast, reaching an annual increase of 6% over the past 10 years. Airline CO==== emissions and their impact on climate change have become a focus of the international community. In 2008, the European union included aviation in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). In 2009, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) issued a worldwide commitment to restrain airline CO==== emissions. In October 2016, the international civil aviation organization (ICAO) formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program, which is known as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation. Regulations on CO==== emissions have exerted an increasing effect on airline operations, pushing airlines toward an effective management of CO==== emissions to alleviate their negative side effect on operational performance. A number of scholars focused on measuring airline performance with the CO==== emissions as an undesirable output (Chang et al., 2014; Cui and Li, 2015; Arjomandi and Seufert, 2014; Liu et al., 2017). When considering CO==== emissions in the evaluation model, the productivity/efficiency of airlines had different characteristics. For example, Asian airlines were regarded to be more economically efficient than European and North American airlines (Distexhe and Perelman, 1994; Arjomandi and Seufert, 2014). However, European airlines tend to have better environmental performance after the inclusion of aviation into ETS.====Service quality poses another challenge for airlines. Good service quality helps an airline to keep customers and maintain its market position. According to Buell et al. (2015), a firm's most profitable customers tend to be attracted to alternatives with superior quality. Currently, no universal definition of airline service quality exists since it is a rather subjective term (Liou et al., 2011). Existing studies mostly investigated airline service quality via several dimensions. For example, Bowen and Headley (2012) divided airline quality into four aspects: on-time performance, involuntary boarding denial, reports of mishandled baggage, and consumer complaints. Among these factors, whether a flight arrives at its destination on time is always the key concern of passengers. Fight delays cause waste of resources not only for passengers but also for airlines (Assaf et al., 2014). Therefore, flight delays has been the subject of several studies due to its potential effect on airline performance (Fan et al., 2014).====Despite the consensus on the positive relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction, disparities exist with regard to the effect of customer satisfaction on airline performance in different regions. Steven et al. (2012) reported that market concentration dampens the relationship between customer satisfaction and airline profitability of the 12 largest US airlines during 2003-2009. Airlines that operate in concentrated markets have fewer incentives to satisfy their customers than airlines that operate in more competitive markets. However, Choi et al. (2013) suggested that although a tradeoff existed between service quality and productivity during 2008-2011, US airlines would overcome it in the long run. A positive, albeit weak relationship between operational efficiency and service quality was identified by Wanke et al. (2015) for Asian airlines. For Chinese airlines, Tsionas et al. (2017) also reported a mutual dependence relationship between airline technical efficiency and delays. Chen et al. (2017) suggested that the relationship between flight delays and carbon emissions affected airlines’ efficiency levels in China during 2006-2014. Since the relationship between service quality and performance has been changing with the operational environment of airlines, it would be meaningful to further identify the relationship between flight delays and airline performance in major airlines worldwide over recent years. This would help operators to adopt appropriate strategies to reduce the possible productivity loss from flight delays.====In summary, airline performance evaluation has been widely recognized as an essential means to help airlines improve their performance and handle fierce competition. Existing studies on airline performance evaluation altered with more contextual or environmental variables incorporated. In particular, CO==== emissions has been an important undesirable output since the announcement of a series of airline CO==== regulations. Flight delays also became an important constraint variable of airline operations. This study would construct an integrated airline productivity performance evaluation model, which simultaneously considers CO==== emissions as an undesirable output in the operations, and flight delays as attributes of operations.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the airline efficiency and productivity literature.

The results produce two important findings. First, Southwest's nonstop entry depressed its rivals' nonstop airfares and connecting airfares. Second, Southwest's connecting entry depressed its rivals' connecting airfares, but did not depress their nonstop airfares. Considering nonstop and connecting services as differentiated products which differ in quality, the findings suggest that firms have quite different fare strategies upon the entry of different quality products.","Since the first low-cost carrier (LCC), Southwest Airlines, established in 1967, LCCs have reached a huge success in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. Unlike traditional legacy carriers who operate on hub-and-spoke structures, LCCs adopt a very different business model which involves point-to-point structures, allowing for higher aircraft utilization. In addition, LCCs are well known for requiring employees to work multiple roles to cut personnel costs.====Such cost-cutting strategy allows LCCs to sell tickets at a relatively low price and maintain competitive advantage. Over the past twenty years, LCCs have been growing rapidly in the US. In 2017, 49% of all domestic passengers travelled with LCCs. Southwest, the leading LCC, itself transported 27.9% of the domestic traffic, making it the largest carrier in the U.S. and the largest LCC worldwide.====Given the fact that LCCs have been so successful, it is not surprising that they have attracted a lot of attention in the literature. Many researchers have shown that LCCs, including Southwest Airlines, lowered airfares on the routes they entered.====However, most of the studies either only looked at nonstop flights, or aggregated across the service types. According to Reiss and Spiller (1989) and Dunn (2008), this may lead to incorrect inference, since nonstop and connecting flights may be regarded as differentiated products in similar markets. This paper fills the gap by discussing Southwest's effects in the context of both service types and comparing their differences.====It should be noted that although Southwest is famous for its P2P routing, it does connect as well, only not to the same degree as traditional hub-and-spoke carriers, like Delta and American. For instance, in 2017, Southwest provided connecting service on 4801 domestic routes, and provided nonstop service on 2011 routes, while for Delta the numbers of routes were 5604 and 755 for connecting and nonstop service, respectively. Passengers were open to use those connecting itineraries as well, especially on mid-haul and long-haul routes, where connecting traffic comprised about 30% and 40% of the domestic traffic, respectively.====The main objective of this work is to study how Southwest's entry affects its rivals' pricing, with a focus on comparing nonstop and connecting flights. All other (e.g. frequencies) being equal, the nonstop service is viewed as a higher quality product compared to the connecting service, and different connecting services also vary in quality using a measure of the extra flight distances.==== A set of price equations are estimated using U.S. airline industry data from 1993 to 2017.====The rest of the paper are composed as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature.

Furthermore, we are able to decompose these markup effects into price and marginal cost effects and evidence suggests that the source of these negative markup effects is primarily driven by negative price responses.","After the 1978 airline industry deregulation, the U.S. airline industry was rife with chronic flight delays due to increased demand and limited capacity. The public frustration and outsized media coverage of flight delays eventually prompted legislation from the U.S. Congress. In 1987, the U.S. Congress enacted the On-Time Disclosure Rule==== allowing the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to track the on-time performance (OTP) of domestic flights operated by large air carriers with at least one percent of domestic passenger revenue (Mayer and Sinai, 2003). The BTS then publicly releases carrier OTP reports on a monthly basis and ranks airlines on how well their flights depart/arrive on time.====The OTP disclosure requirements have changed over the years. Initially, airlines were required to submit information regarding their scheduled and actual flight departure/arrival times, flight cancellations and diversions. In 1995, supplementary disclosure requirements were added, namely delayed/canceled flights due to mechanical problems, aircraft's tail number and taxi and airborne times. In 2003, carriers were required to disclose specific causes of delay and in 2008, the tarmac rule was enacted prohibiting carriers from letting an aircraft on the tarmac for more than 3 h without deplaning passengers (Yimga and Gorjidooz, 2019; Forbes et al., 2019). Understanding supply-side behavior in the airline industry has customarily been an important research area that has been studied extensively.====Persistent growth in air travel, along with market structure changes from the emergence of low cost carriers, aviation technology advancements (especially the popularity of regional jets with different plane sizes) and an acceleration in industry consolidation, has stimulated a large body of research on assessing the effects of flight delays. On the one hand, consumers have become more sensitive to airline OTP and estimates of consumer welfare costs associated with flight delays are in the billions of dollars each year (Ball et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2012; Gayle and Yimga, 2018). Air traffic congestion and delay will likely become even more prominent given the projected demand growth in the coming decades. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) projects total enplanements to grow by 40 percent by 2038.==== On the other hand, how air transportation supply responds to flight delay remains an area with limited empirical investigation. The element that receives the most attention is that incurred directly by airlines through increased operating expenses (Zou and Chen, 2017). Flight delay requires the consumption of extra fuel, labor, capital, and other scarce resources necessary in the airline production function. These additional inputs add to airline operating costs.====In this study, we estimate the effect of flight delays on product markups. Examining this relationship, ultimately, allows us to measure the effects of flight delays on airline market power. We exploit a structural econometric model of demand and supply to decompose the estimated markup effects into price and marginal cost effects. A key feature of the model is that it does not require data on cost to infer the effects of flight delay on marginal cost and market power.====Our empirical analysis starts by estimating a discrete choice model of air travel demand which serves the purpose of verifying that passengers’ choice behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that flights associated with flight delays are less desirable. We then proceed to specifying the supply side assuming that prices are set according to a static differentiated products Bertrand-Nash equilibrium with multiproduct firms. With the static Bertrand-Nash assumption, we derive product-specific markups and recover product-level marginal costs. With the estimated markups and marginal costs in hand, we are able to specify and estimate markup, price and marginal cost equations as functions of flight delay. These functions allow us to measure the effects of flight delay on markup and investigate whether the markup effects are primarily driven by price changes rather than changes in marginal cost.====Several conclusions emerge from the empirical analysis. First, other things equal and consistent with the extant literature, we find that flight delays have a negative effect on consumers’ utility.==== We also find that flight delays have a negative effect on market power and further examination reveals that market power decreases primarily due to the downward pressure flight delays exert on prices. We conduct a battery of robustness checks using different measures of flight delay and find qualitative similar results. This finding mirrors that of Forbes (2008) who found that prices fall in response to longer flight delays, suggesting that a decrease in product quality (measured as OTP in this case) has a strong negative effect on the market price.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In the U.S., the three common types of airport use agreements are the residual method, the compensatory method, and the hybrid method. Under a residual agreement, the financial risk of the host airport is borne by the signatory airlines, and in return, the signatory airlines pay reduced user fees. Under a compensatory agreement, however, airports bear their own financial risks in the absence of a signatory airline. A hybrid agreement combines the features of residual and compensatory agreements. For example, under a hybrid agreement, airports usually bear their own financial risks in terminal operations while the signatory airlines take over the financial risks in airfield operations. The aim of this paper is to determine whether these three types of business agreements affect airport operational efficiency. Using 2009 to 2016 yearly data of 59 U.S. hub airports, we find that airports with residual-type agreements tend to have lower operational efficiency. This implies that, although under a residual agreement, the signatory airlines pay favorable airport fees and charges, increased airport inefficiency may undercut any potential benefits of the agreement.","In the U.S., while airlines and airports are separate entities, they form an absolutely inseparable vertical relationship in air transportation. The close coordination of the two entities, through their roles and activities in the air transportation network, is indispensable and highly critical for the greater interests of efficiency and welfare beyond the entities themselves. In light of the vast importance of their coordination and mutual reliance, bilateral contracting is integral to the business relationship between airports and airlines.====While airlines in the U.S. are privately owned and managed, airports in the U.S. are owned and operated by local governments or port authorities and financed by local governments. The main financial sources of U.S. airports are user charges, state/local government programs, Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants, and passenger facility charges (Graham, 2004). Airport user charges are basically aeronautical revenues and non-aeronautical revenues. User charges are used to recover operating expenditures and debt service costs (FAA, 1999). The AIP was established for the purpose of supporting a national integrated airport system. Grants are allocated by the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) based on passenger volume and project basis (Fuhr and Beckers, 2009). Passenger facility charges are enplanement fees charged directly to passengers. Passenger facility charges are usually used for capital projects and maintenance/repair expenditures (FAA, 1999). Yet these sources are not sufficient to fund capital projects and sustain airport operations. For example, airports in the U.S. needed approximately $14.3 billion per year between 2005 and 2009, but the AIP supported just over $3.5 billion in 2006, leaving a gap of $10.8 billion to be funded with other sources (National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, 2007). Thus, airports must seek additional funding opportunities to sustain their capital projects and reduce financial uncertainty.====Having a stable stream of revenues from passenger and cargo services as well as non-aeronautical businesses helps airports maintain a sound financial footing. Although non-aeronautical revenues have been vital for break-even budgets in recent years, airports need to establish various contractual agreements with airlines to cover potential financial risks. Especially in recent decades following the deregulation in 1978, financial volatility within the airline industry could easily spill over to airports as a result of increased airline bankruptcies and cessations of unprofitable service routes. Meanwhile, many airlines are seeking increased values or returns from their relationships with airports. Besides user fees’ discounts, airlines also want to increase their connections and abilities to offer a wider range of services to passengers at their hubs. Their increased willingness to shop around also reflects the contestability of the airline industry (Carney and Mew, 2003). Thus, forging a strong and mutually beneficial business relationship with airlines is paramount to airports. When entering a contractual agreement with a tenant airline, an airport must balance between risk and reward, and it must ensure that the outcomes of the agreement are beneficial not only to itself but also to the airline.====For airlines, in addition to securing airport facilities for operations, a vertical contractual relationship with an airport could enable airlines to expand market power by controlling and even potentially foreclosing upstream airport facilities from downstream rivals in the long run. Moreover, airlines could avoid higher airport fees through long-term contractual agreements with airports (Barbot, 2011). However, increased air traffic volumes in recent years have put a substantial constraint on airport capacity. According to the ==== (2017), passenger volume in the U.S. is expected to rise by an average of 1.9% per year over the next 20 years. Airport capacity is important to airlines, and airports need reliable partners in the airline industry to ascertain sufficient passengers or customers that are fundamental to the long-term growth and financial stability of the airport. Competition in the downstream air travel market also means that airlines must be strategic about their decisions on routes, connections, service levels and their dealings with airports.====Therefore, vertical contractual agreements between airlines and airports are the bread and butter of the U.S. air transportation system. Besides serving as a legally binding document, contracts enable and motivate the parties involved to work together and take actions that benefit each other. Nevertheless, if either party cannot fully observe or control the other party's action or behavior, the problem of moral hazard may arise (Holmstrom, 1979). Moral hazard in this context refers to the lack of effort on the part of the agent (Eisenhardt, 1989). In other words, the agent may “shirk” or may not put forth sufficient effort. This could have implications for air transportation efficiency since the signatory airlines, as the principal, is not able to control the host airport's performance in operations.====In the U.S., residual, compensatory and hybrid are three common types of airport use agreements. Airports adopting residual agreements obtain a financial guarantee from signatory airlines, and in return, signatory airlines pay reduced airport fees depending on the airport's operating expenditures and non-aeronautical revenues. Unlike the residual method, the compensatory method requires that airports bear their own financial risks in the absence of signatory airlines. The hybrid method is a combination of residual and compensatory methods. Under a hybrid agreement setting, the residual method is usually applied to airfield operations while the compensatory method is utilized in terminal operations.====In this study, we examine these three common types of airport-airline agreements and their impacts on airport operational performance. To the best of our knowledge, the implications of the three common use agreement methods on airport operational efficiency have not been previously studied. This study seeks to fill the void in the literature by looking into the outcomes of the use agreements. The results will shed light on the vertical relationships between airports and airlines and enhance our understanding of the effect of their use agreements on the operational performance of airports. Additionally, the outcomes of this research will enable airport management to make informed decisions on balancing risks and rewards and to sustain and improve airports’ coordination with their tenants for the greater benefits of society.====This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the three use agreement methods. In Section 3, we give a brief review of the studies on the airport-airlines vertical relationship and airport efficiency.

The goal of this paper is to explore the relationships between ,"As the people who perform and manage flight work, civil pilots play a vital role in in-flight safety. Consequently, civil pilot safety behavior is crucial to the overall safety performance of any airline (Kao et al., 2009). However, most existing researches, conducted from the perspective of the impact of mental process and mental characteristics of individual on pilots' safety operation behaviors, have focused cognition perspective, personality perspective, social cognition perspective. However, very few researchers have explored the role of mental state overlooked with regard to aviation safety. In reality, mental disorders may increase the risk of accidents and incidents by impair the performance of pilots (Vuorio et al., 2017).

Reduction in boarding time can benefit airline carriers and airports and improve passenger satisfaction. However, aisle ==== caused by passengers placing their luggage during boarding is a key factor leading to cabin congestion and low boarding efficiency. Therefore, the storage time for the carry-on luggage and its influencing factors is analyzed in this study. An experiment was conducted in a B737-800 model (1/3 size) to explore the factors effecting the time of luggage storage, and a new effective model of luggage storage time is proposed through a significance test and data fitting. The results show that the age of passengers, the type and quantity of luggage, and the existing luggage in the luggage bin have a significant impact on the luggage storage time; the rule of the variation in luggage placing time is similar between young adult passengers and middle aged passengers; the impact of the existing luggage in the overhead bin on the luggage storage time shows a stable trend in the initial period, but with the quantity of the luggage increasing to a certain point, the luggage storage time begins to increase sharply, which is known as a “jump”; and the luggage type has a great influence on the threshold value of jump. The results of the study can provide a reference for airlines to manage cabin luggage to improve boarding efficiency and improve passenger experience.","Efficient aircraft turnaround is an important factor in the competition between airlines. With the increase of passenger traffic, the reliability of the ground operation has become increasingly significant (Schmidt, 2017), and directly affects the operation efficiency, costs, and profits of the airline. The duration of turnaround for a Boeing 737–900 is 45 min (Coppens et al., 2019). Estimates for possible cost savings due to a reduction of the turnaround time of 1 min $30/min (Nyquist and Mcfadden, 2008), which can sum up to several hundred million dollars per year for a large airline (Neumann, 2019).====To ensure a reliable and efficient turnaround time, the critical path of the process should be in the focus for improvement. Aircraft turnaround is composed of aviation fuel supply, cleaning, luggage placement, and passenger boarding. Among them, passenger boarding is one of the most time-consuming links (Bazargan, 2010), and is usually on the critical path as the last link of the turnaround (Schmidt, 2017). Its efficiency determines the estimated withdrawal time to a certain extent (SESAR, 2014), and may have a significant impact on the whole operation of the aircraft. For example, the boarding time of 200 passengers in the 1990s was approximately 22 min (Marelli et al., 1998), and a survey by Zurich airport in 2009 found that the time had increased to 40 min (Steiner and Philipp, 2009), occupying a total of 40%–60% of turnaround time for short trips (Shang et al., 2010). Therefore, shortening the passenger boarding time is one of the keys to improving the efficiency of aircraft turnaround (Horstmeier and Haan, 2001).====To reduce the boarding time, many scholars have recently begun exploring the factors that affect boarding efficiency. Research has shown that interference in the passenger cabin is the main reason for congestion in the aisle and the decrease in boarding efficiency (Van et al., 2005; Bazargan, 2007; Soolaki et al., 2012; Kuo, 2015; Shi and Zhang, 2015). To reduce boarding interference, some scholars have proposed orderly boarding sequences, such as back to front (BF), outside to inside (OI), half-block (Landeghem and Beuselinck, 2002), reverse pyramid (RP) (Van et al., 2005, the Steffen strategy (Steffen, 2008), and free (Qiang et al., 2014), which are different from random boarding. Apart from boarding strategies, some studies have focused on group behavior (Zeineddine, 2017; Tang et al., 2018a, Tang et al., 2018b), individual properties (Tang et al., 2012, Notomista et al., 2016), baggage (Milne and Kelly, 2014; Milne and Salari, 2016, Tang et al., 2018b), aircraft interior design (Schmidt, 2017; Schultz et al., 2013; Schultz, 2017a, Schultz, 2017b; Schultz, 2018), evaluation of the boarding progress (Schultz, 2017c), and aircraft boarding prediction. Among all boarding interferences, aisle interference refers to a situation in which passengers are prevented from moving forward by other passengers in front of them placing their luggage. It is considered to be a key factor affecting boarding efficiency (Nyquist and Mcfadden, 2008; Steffen, 2008; Canzani and Lechner, 2014; Milne and Kelly, 2014; Qiang et al., 2014; Milne and Salari, 2016), and with the increase of passengers' luggage, the impact is increasingly significant. Previous studies have shown that the boarding time of an A320 aircraft was 20–35 min (Landeghem and Beuselinck, 2002; Van et al., 2005; Bazargan, 2007; Nyquist and Mcfadden, 2008; Iyigunlu et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2016), the average speed of passengers in the aisle without interference was approximately 1 row/s (Steiner and Philipp, 2009; Mas et al., 2013; Budesca et al., 2014; Ren and Tang, 2014), and that the seat interference time was 3.6 s–18 s (Ferrari and Nagel, 2005; Soolaki et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2012). However, the aisle interference time was 6–30 s (Steffen and Hotchkiss, 2012; Katja et al., 2013; Milne and Kelly, 2014). It can be seen that the aisle interference consumes much more time, and is the main factor for the decrease in boarding efficiency. In other words, reducing aisle interference improves boarding efficiency.====Some boarding strategies for reducing luggage interference have been suggested (Katja et al., 2013; Milne and Kelly, 2014; Qiang et al., 2014; Milne and Salari, 2016; Notomista et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2017). However, because the delays caused by the passengers placing luggage is influenced by many factors, such as luggage quantity (Ferrari and Nagel, 2005; Steiner and Philipp, 2009; Shang et al., 2010; Katja et al., 2013; Milne and Kelly, 2014; Ren et al., 2016), luggage bin capacity (Shang et al., 2010; Zeineddine, 2017), existing luggage in the luggage bin (Ferrari and Nagel, 2005; Shang et al., 2010), passengers' genders (Giitsidis and Sirakoulis, 2016), and passengers’ ages (Budesca et al., 2014; Giitsidis and Sirakoulis, 2016), causing significant uncertainty in the delay. In some studies, a feasible method is to assign a random value to the delay time by a probability distribution (Sun et al., 2013; Carmona et al., 2014; Giitsidis and Sirakoulis, 2016). However, this method ignores another important problem in the study of boarding efficiency—the mechanisms of aisle interference, and their influencing factors. Currently, only a few studies have provided a model for interference time, and most of them use a bin occupancy model (Ferrari and Nagel, 2005), bin model, hyperbolic model (Shang et al., 2010), luggage stowing time model (Notomista et al., 2016), or trigonometric distribution (Landeghem and Beuselinck, 2002; Schultz et al., 2013; Budesca et al., 2014; Canzani and Lechner, 2014; Iyigunlu et al., 2015). However, these models are mainly based on an incomplete observation of the boarding process, and the consideration of influencing factors for aisle interference is not exhaustive. For example, factors such as the size and weight of luggage, and the gender and age of passengers, are not considered. Moreover, such observation lacks comprehensive and accurate statistics, and its applicability in China has not yet been tested. Experimentation is an effective method for overcoming the above problems, and some scholars have adopted experimental methods for studying boarding problems. However, the main aspects of these studies are passenger check-in luggage measurements, seat interference simulation, and equivalent boarding experiments, e.g., a 72-person boarding narrow-body mock airplane experiment (Steffen and Hotchkiss, 2012), 30-person classroom experiment (Miura and Nishinari, 2017), 40-person bus experiment (Qiang, 2017), or micro-behaviors trials involving 35 subjects inside a cabin section (Gwynne et al., 2018). These experiments were conducted in less realistic test setups. However, two airline field trials are used to research a stochastic boarding model (Schultz, 2018). In this paper, a microscopic approach is used to model the passenger behavior. This model is used to compare measurements from field trials of boarding procedures with simulation results and demonstrates a deviation smaller than 5%. Especially this paper provides a comprehensive set of operational data as a reliable basis for the calibration of a stochastic boarding model, including classification of boarding times, arrival and departure rates of passengers at the aircraft door, individual durations to store hand luggage, and timestamps for passenger interactions during seating. Since arrival at the aircraft, storage of hand luggage, and interactions during the seating process are identified as major input factors for the individual passenger behavior, specific field trials provide a fundamental database to calibrate these factors. However, what factors and how to affect the efficiency of boarding in the boarding process, such as the excessive storage of luggage, or the personal characteristics of passengers, has not been studied in depth. And the author also mentioned in the article that the boarding is also driven by external factors, which are currently not covered by the stochastic boarding model. There is no clearer direction on how to improve the boarding strategy or the proposal to enable new infrastructure. Therefore, this paper builds a mathematical model for analysis the factors which affect the time of storage luggage by experimental test. Based on a 48-seat boarding experiment in a prototype cabin (Ren and Xu, 2018), we classify the interference to aid in analyzing airplane boarding, and compare the boarding time and perceived time for six boarding strategies to find the efficient strategies. This time, a baggage experiment is conducted for an entire passenger group so as to determine the factors affecting the time of baggage placement, perform a significant analysis, and obtain a final boarding interference model. This is the main work of this study.====Therefore, based on the characteristics of Chinese passengers (i.e. they carry more luggage, and more than 80% of passengers carry more than 1 piece of luggage based on a survey), and because the order of boarding is difficult to organize, this study breaks through the current status of boarding research focusing on the order of passengers, and takes aisle interference and a bin model as research emphases. First, the characteristics of four types of luggage storage models from previous studies are compared, and the trend of model optimization is analyzed. Through field observation of passengers and their luggage characteristics, the key factors in aisle interference were clarified. Second, experiments observing 148 people placing luggage in a high-fidelity environment were conducted. A close relationship between aisle interference and luggage size, weight, and number was found, and a definition of a luggage specification index was suggested. Finally, a quantification formula for a model of luggage storage time was obtained from the experimental data. The research provides a theoretical contribution to a model for finding the mechanisms of boarding interference, based on the experimental measurements. In that regard, it is of practical significance. Managers can understand the key factors affecting boarding time and manage cabin luggage to improve boarding efficiency, such as by strictly limiting the number of pieces of luggage or increasing the bin capacity.",A new model of luggage storage time while boarding an airplane: An experimental test,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303405,24 January 2020,2020,Research Article,405.0

According to the annual reports made on the carried passengers that have been published by Iran Civil Aviation Organization (“www.cao.ir,” n.d.), average annual growth rate of the number of the carried passengers by international airlines has been 14.1% from 2014 to 2018, which demonstrates the Iranian passengers’ desire to fly with the mentioned carriers. This data gives us a clue that Iranian airlines have been facing a crisis leading to market share loss.====In order to overcome this crisis, domestic airlines should pay attention to the passenger's expectations of their services. Airlines need to discover new ways to emphasize essential service items and reduce the time and energy consumed on less important service items (Liou et al., 2011). The approach, by which airlines allocate services to their customers in order to increase their satisfaction, has always been a crucial issue for the aforementioned companies. Most authors suggested a meaningful association between aspects of service quality and customer satisfaction (Ali et al., 2015).====Several studies attempted to determine some service quality dimensions in the airline industry (Y.-H. Chang and Yeh, 2002; Chen and Chang, 2005; Liou and Tzeng, 2007; Park et al., 2004; Tsaur et al., 2002). However, not all service dimensions are equally important to all passengers, because no two passengers are accurately alike, especially when demographics; the purposes of travel and ethnic background is considered (Gilbert and Wong, 2003). Since the past research revealed the fact that satisfaction can be considered as a function of pre-purchase expectation and perception of disconfirmation (Oliver, 1980), an intriguing question raised: How do airlines become capable of satisfying their customers with regard to their different pre-purchase expectations (Füller and Matzler, 2008)?====The present study answers to above question that without considering various needs and expectations of different customers, increasing the quality of service does not lead to customers' satisfaction at all. Thus, this study argues that customers should be segmented based on their expectations into distinctive groups in order to determine the satisfaction attributes of each class. Since, customer segmentation is usually the first step towards the analysis of customer behaviors in service companies (Yang et al., 2002). Moreover, if service providers examine the customers’ needs, they will have adequate capacity to meet their requirements (Porter, 1980). Therefore, a service company should identify groups of customers with homogenous behaviors and try to adapt their offer as much as possible to the unique needs of the segment members (Kara and Kaynak, 1997).====Therefore, this study suggested a novel model of customer segmentation based on behavioral variables in order to provide distinctive groups of customers by similar expectations for the airline industry. Since different levels of expectation will be related to different customer behavior and these expectation influence customer-perceived service quality, which is nowadays considered to be a key factor to obtain a competitive advantage(Diaz-Martin et al., 2000).====Previous research used RFM model (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) to cluster customers. It is one of the most prominent models of clustering that adjusts an effective market segmentation for increasing the duration of the customer's lifecycle (Linoff and Berry, 2002). Teichert et al. (2008) proposed that behavioral variables should be added to the traditional socio-demographic and socio-economic variables in order to segment airline passengers. Moreover, Teichert et al. (2008) revised RFM model to incorporate attitudinal variables. Chiang (2014) proposed FMCN model by adding cancelation times and the number of family members as behavioral variables. DehghaniZadeh et al. (2018) revised RFM model to LDCFR, and added length and combination of distance and class rate to it. The present research proposed the ICF model with the aim of designing behavioral variables that cluster customers based on their common expectations. Thus, we selected flight intent, flight class, and frequency as the variables.====This study aimed to extract several service quality attributes by reviewing the related literature and conducting some deep interviews in order to identify the most relevant attributes according to the SERVQUAL in the Iranian airlines market. Even though, a number of researches applied SERVQUAL for measuring the quality of airline service, this study specifically measured customer satisfaction with the quality of airline service quality in each cluster of passengers.====The study design is presented here. The next section briefly reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 describes clustering with the ICF model, customization of service quality attributes, Kano model, Importance-Satisfaction analysis, and data collection. Section 4 reports and discusses the results.

The findings show that successful airport surge capacity management is closely related to prioritizing the flights and operational activities; considering the influx of local people to airports and local infrastructure capacity in the planning phase; developing suitable methods to encourage people to take part in surge operations; providing uninterrupted communication in and out of airport. In view of the above-stated findings this study suggests that airports can meet the surge demand through systematic capacity planning of the existing and additional human, supply, system and space elements by considering experienced or anticipated capacity shortages in disaster conditions.","As transit points, airports are illustrated places in which “====” thanks to the various services which are provided in their unique environment (Huang et al., 2018). In addition, the airports offer services such as runway, apron, storage, ground handling to airlines and cargo companies for their regular operations (Oum and Yu, 2004; Vertalka, 2012). In the meantime, the airports play an important role in humanitarian operations (Choi and Hanaoka, 2017b; Hult and Segell, 2017; Smith, 2010). The importance of airports in disaster relief operations, as a part of humanitarian supply chain, comes from the intrinsic characteristics of airports such as having large buildings, handling systems and intermodal access (Smith James Fielding, 2007). This potential enables airports to be used as logistics centers, base camps, medical centers, staging and sheltering areas to serve disaster affected communities in the humanitarian supply chain system. In these facilities, relief goods are sorted and stored and airport and aid staff are accommodated (Choi and Hanaoka, 2017a; Kanaya, 2012). In this sense, airports are expected to fulfill critical functions as a foul-weather friend of societies in disaster conditions besides facilitating and enriching the transport experience of their stakeholders in normal times. Therefore, airport authorities must be aware of the airports’ role as “====” and “====”. Within this scope, they should have the sense of responsibility to determine a vision for the role of airports in humanitarian operations (Wells and Young, 2004).====Airports which operate in dynamic environments must have the capability of meeting the requirements of unexpected conditions (Butter, 2010). This can be achieved by creating airport-specific and realistic airport emergency plans (AEP). AEP is defined as a warranty to provide airport business continuity, protect human life and airport infrastructure in the face of natural or man-made disasters (Ashford et al., 2011; Kraus and Vladimír Plos, 2014). In order to have successful airport disaster response operations, AEPs specify the functions of relevant stakeholders to accomplish assigned responsibilities, formalize the organizational relationships to establish a ground for successful coordination determine the required staff, materials and equipment, make demand forecasts, prepare airport physical infrastructure and analyze airport capacity (Ashford et al., 2011; Enoma and Allen, 2007; Kenville, 2005).====Airport capacity, as a critical part of AEP, is regarded as one of the important factors in airport operations management (Jacquillat and Odoni, 2018). Airport capacity analysis measures the effectiveness of airport system elements in order to manage passenger flow and aircraft movement, calculate the extent of delays in the system (Ashford et al., 2011). In addition to these reactive indicators, the airport capacity assessment gives direction to airport managers to understand the performance of. their airport and take proactive actions for satisfying related stakeholders’ needs (Avisu, 2016; Jacquillat and Odoni, 2018). Otherwise, irreversible airport capacity decisions cause waste of significant capital investment and hinder humanitarian activities of airports as well as their daily operations.====Airport capacity refers to the capability of managing an entire airport's operations. But, the majority of definitions focus on the runway capacity as a single indicator of airport capacity. Albers et al. (2005) revealed a comprehensive list of airport operational activities which includes logistics and operational activities, human resource management, airport technological development and the facilities where these activities take place. In the meanwhile, the “====” indicates that airports like other sophisticated systems consists of integrated sub-systems which have different capacity requirements (Albers et al., 2005). For this reason, it can be misleading to plan the capacity of complex systems by considering mainly one factor. This can create systemwide bottlenecks and delays in the operations (Ashford et al., 2011). Therefore, airport logistics operations can be accomplished by looking at the complete picture of aerodrome operations with the aim of optimizing the planning and utilization of all resources. At this juncture, surge capacity concept, which is mainly discussed in healthcare setting and supply chain flexibility (SCF) concept, can be applied to plan airport disaster response capacity. The reason of this proposal is owing to the similarities between the surge capacity and SCF as well as the similarities between healthcare and aviation industry (McConaughey, 2008). The most eminent similarities between both industries stem from the complexity of business environment, the high level of uncertainty and risks in their operations, the need to employ highly specialized people, the standard work processes, the use of checklists for operational safety, the vital consequences of mistakes, the aim of operating with zero error, working in team to manage emergencies of which conditions change from one moment to the other (Belote, 2015; de Korne et al., 2010; Helmreich and Davies, 2004). Thus, the methods used by healthcare industries can be applied to the airports so as to carry out their operations smoothly in a time that society literally need help. On the other hand, there is a similarity between surge capacity and SCF because they do not solely focus on one element of the problem. On the contrary, they evaluate conditions by considering different facets of the conditions from a holistic point of view.====Several scenarios can be thought for the airports located in a disaster affected region: (1) An airport's both airside or landside facilities can be severely damaged and non-operational. (2) Its airside facilities can be damaged and cannot be utilized for logistics operations. But it can be used for other humanitarian purposes. (3) Despite the minor damages, an airport can continue its operation. This research aims to find out the elements of “airport logistics surge capacity”, the possible problems that can be faced in surge capacity management, the antecedents for successful surge operations at airports, the importance of airport disaster preparedness for immediate and effective response, and relationships between each element of surge capacity in the first phase of disaster management regarding the third scenario. The reason of selecting one scenario and one function in this research is that investigating all of these scenarios and functions is beyond a single research paper.====According to Polater's (2018) literature review there is very little empirical evidence about the logistics role of airports in disaster operations, let alone investigating it particularly from surge capacity and SCF perspectives. The previous literature has made a significant contribution to present general framework of airport disaster management (Baučić and Medak, 2015; Chang and Yeh, 2016; Choi and Hanaoka, 2017a; Choi et al., 2019; Hanaoka et al., 2013; Hellingrath et al., 2015; Kanyi, Kamau and Mireri, 2016a; James Fielding Smith, 2009; Wu and Ren, 2016; Yang et al., 2012). However, there is a lack of research that classifies the factors affecting airport disaster operations, details their constitutive elements and determines relationships between them. Thus, it can be claimed that there is a need of research that reveals each factor of surge capacity in airport industry for non-aviation related disasters. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to analyze the airport non-aviation disasters from surge capacity and SCF perspectives in the literature. The key questions of this study are as follows:====This paper seeks to offer a general framework of the airport logistics surge capacity concept rather than investigating an individual airport's specific problem. I believe that the findings of this paper will have significant contributions to the disaster literature and airport industry. Firstly, it adapts the “surge capacity” concept from the healthcare to the airport industry. Second, this investigation attempts to propose a new capacity development framework for temporary disaster response operations, namely “airport logistics surge capacity”. Thirdly, the research provides evidences of surge capacity elements in airport setting.====In the remainder of this paper, a review of airport capacity, SCF and surge capacity literature are to be presented. The following section explains the research methodology, followed by the presentation of empirical results.

Particularly, the relevance of passenger satisfaction has been emphasized. However, although different research approaches have been used, there is still a gap related to understanding the several relationships between aspects associated with passenger satisfaction with the airport. In this study, a comprehensive conceptual model, which includes the relationships between key antecedents and consequences of passenger satisfaction, was developed and examined. Using ==== analysis, several findings concerning passenger expectations, airport service quality, switching costs for changing airports, and passenger loyalty towards the airport are stressed.","The airport industry has undergone major changes over recent decades. During this period, we have been witnessing a paradigm shift from seeing airports solely as huge public facilities towards the concept of multi-services business organizations. As a result, airport executives have become more concerned with their businesses performance, as well as understanding passenger experience at the airport, which has become crucial for airport management.====According to the literature, a positive experience at the airport can influence passenger's intentions to purchase in commercial areas (Chung, 2015; Lin and Chen, 2013; Lu, 2014; Sohn and Lee, 2017), increase their reuse intention (Al-Refaie et al., 2014; Nesset and Helgesen, 2014), induce positive word-of-mouth (Nesset and Helgesen, 2014; Wattanacharoensil et al., 2016), and can be a driver of airport competitiveness (Graham, 2014; Parrela, 2013; Wattanacharoensil et al., 2017). However, despite its relevance for airport management, literature on passenger experience is scarce and tends to emphasize a commercial and business viewpoint, instead of a passenger-based perspective (Wattanacharoensil et al., 2016). As such, more research on the passenger-airport interaction and their behavioral attitudes towards the airport is needed in order to support airport planning and operating management efforts.====In this context, the concept of customer satisfaction, their antecedents and consequences, are key elements for examining the passenger experience in the airport context. Customer satisfaction reflects a post-consumption evaluative judgment concerning a product, service, or firm (Falk et al., 2010; Oliver, 2015; Wilson et al., 2012). Antecedents are those elements expected to influence the level of satisfaction, while consequences are the expected effects of the level of satisfaction.====Customer satisfaction has long been a central issue in the Services literature, but has not been fully explored in the airport industry. Regarding airports, passenger satisfaction has been associated to their perceptions of service quality and servicescape, their emotions, their demographic characteristics, and their loyalty (Bezerra and Gomes, 2015; Fodness and Murray, 2007; Moon et al., 2016; Wattanacharoensil et al., 2016). Several research models have been used, but only a few studies were based on a comprehensive approach to the relationships between the antecedents and consequences of passenger satisfaction in the airport context. Particularly, the effects of passenger perceptions and behavioral attitudes in multi-airport regions seem to be under-researched. This paper is aimed at helping to fill these gaps, by developing and testing a comprehensive and reliable model of the relationships associated with the passenger experience and analyzing their perceptions and attitudes in the context of a multi-airport region, which provides a passenger-perspective of the competitive dynamics in the airport industry.====Bearing these considerations in mind, satisfaction is taken as the central element of the passenger experience at the airport and the reserch effort is focused on identifying and estimating the relationships between the antecedents and consequences of the passenger satisfaction with the airport. Hence, three objectives were followed:====To accomplish these objectives, a survey was applied to departing passengers in one of the main Brazilian airports located in a multi-airport region. Grounded on extensive review of the literature and accounting for specific features of the airport services, a theoretical model of the antecedents and consequences of passenger satisfaction was developed and used to test several research hypotheses. Data analysis was based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), namely the covariance-based approach (CB-SEM). The reason for CB-SEM in this paper is twofold. First, this method has been traditionaly used in several service sectors for years and sample size was adequate in view of the method requirements. Second, this study tested several relationships well-grounded in the theory but some of those for the first time used in the airport sector, thus CB-SEM is appropriate for a confirmatory approach (Hair et al., 2017).====In the next section, a background on customer satisfaction and the current state-of-the-art of the research related to passenger satisfaction in the airport context is provided. In section 3, the conceptual model and hypotheses are explained. In section 4, the research methods are described. Results are presented and discussed in section 5.

However, they have been rarely included in several energy-related studies due to the complexity of their mechanical and operational systems. The purpose of this research is to propose benchmark metrics to investigate the energy performance of existing and future airport terminal buildings. By using measured data of total 30 existing ones in North America and simulated results of total 90 specific space type models, a more improved ==== model can refine the values for average of energy use. When revalued from their characteristics based on the refined average, energy performance forecasts are improved by from 1.1% to 3.0% as compared to the case of the simple average. In addition, it can be used to define a higher energy baseline reflecting some weights adjusted by the building characteristics and to apply it into the space configurations for new airport terminal buildings.","After the College Park Airport in Maryland in 1909, more than 44,000 Airport Terminal Buildings (ATBs) worldwide have been consistently developed to satisfy the rapid growth of the aviation industry (The Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commision, 2015; CIA, 2010). Over the 100 years of commercial flight services, numerous changes in engineering, technology, business program, and operational strategy have improved the design and planning related to their functionality and users' convenience in ATBs. In order to carry out several demands of the services according to environmental specificities, some major aviation agencies and institutions have assisted ATBs to (be) design (ed) as commercial complexes that can meet more intense demands of logistics and transports (TRB., 2010b, TRB., 2010a; TRB, 2012; FAA, 2017; ICAO, 2017). However, several systematic and programmatic complexities in ATB design and planning have prevented the quantification of the building's performance with respect to ATBs unlike office buildings, malls, hospitals, and other major building types. This situation is directly related to the difficulty in evaluating ATB's energy performance. For this reason, many researchers and designers have not been able to refer to the energy optimal design of ATBs.====In order to define building's energy performance, most energy analysts use the concept of the Energy Use Intensity (EUI: kWh/m====-yr or kBtu/sf-yr) to measure energy consumption levels relative to the building's gross area (AIA, 2012; USEIA, 2008; USDOE, 2013, USDOE, 2013). The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) report is typically used to compare the performance as building types for energy benchmarks. According to the report, major commercial buildings are categorized as 14 types: education, food sales, food service, health care, lodging, retail, office, public assembly, public order and safety, religious worship, service, warehouse and storage, other, and vacant (USEIA, 2008). By using over 5000 measured data, the CBECS report indicates EUIs of the 14 building types. For instance, it presents the surveyed results that the EUI of Office Buildings is 293.1 kWh/m====-yr, and Health Care is 592.2 kWh/m====-yr, respectively.====However, even though airports, bus stations, train stations, subway stations, and ship berthing facilities are very diverse in terms of the functionalities and operational characteristics, they have not appropriately categorized in details (USDOE, 2013, USDOE, 2013; Lee and Kim, 2017; USDOE, 2013, USDOE, 2013). Among the types, ATBs are one of the largest energy consuming buildings and the largest-scaled building complexes. Some reports and survey results are available to confirm the energy use intensity of some airports at North America (Architecture, 2030, 2012; USEIA, 2008). However, since the number of cases is quite small, it is hard to define appropriate energy consumption levels related to size, business type, number of passengers, and weather conditions (Baxter et al., 2018; Malik, 2017). Even some studies dealing with high refined surveys and advanced performance evaluation models used have not categorized energy issues of ATBs (Chao et al., 2017; Eshtaiwi et al., 2018). Such a situation makes it difficult for researchers to build energy performance guidelines, thus many designers and engineers still do not clearly refer to energy optimal ATBs. Several studies developed energy efficiency measures through the experiments and simulations of building's envelope conditions in large areas, and other studies which have dealt with airside facilities, ground power equipment suggested theoretical and empirical methods to define air quality with quantification of CO====, SO====, and NO==== by and energy consumption of aircrafts by surveys and some prediction models (Cui and Li, 2015; Sukumaran and Sudhakar, 2018; Kılkıs and Kılkıs, 2017a, Kılkıs and Kılkıs, 2017b). In order to construct a methodology for synthesizing some data from these sporadic studies, there have been some studies that suggested predictive and deterministic models using subjective surveys or advanced statistical methods (Huang et al., 2015; Baltazar et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015). Moreover, containing useful analyses about the performance benchmarks for airports have focused on the sustainability of the entire airport system, including a lot of information in various fields such as airside, employment and emission, so the allocation of ATB's own planning issues have not been very large (Postorino and Mantecchini, 2014; Kilkis & Kilkis, 2016; Kılkıs and Kılkıs, 2017a, Kılkıs and Kılkıs, 2017b). Studies that have constructed a methodology for improving the energy efficiency of the HVAC system by highlighting the relationship between the characteristics of space planning and passengers, or that have revealed actual commissioning results through the analysis of actual results specifications of airport-specific HVAC systems, provide very useful information. However, they have some weaknesses to generalize because most studies are limited to specific conditions of specific airports (De Rubeis et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Sukumaran and Sudhakar, 2018; Postorino and Mantecchini, 2014). Therefore, it is necessary to develop an energy benchmark metric to investigate the level of energy performance of ATBs.====After ATBs have played a commercially important role, many energy-related studies analyzed buildings’ performance and gathered measured data to estimate their energy end use. Despite such efforts, there has been still a lack of guidelines or manuals for energy efficient buildings. Even though the growing demands of energy efficient ATBs, useful energy performance metrics have not been proposed either. In the future, as well as commercial purposes, it will become clear that more complex systems will be required in terms of safety and security. The existing benchmark research of corresponding energy consumption levels will not be able to meet the levels required by future increasing demands. Although there have been insightful references for the air transport business and its characteristics, it is also true that there have been no appropriate intersection with studies in the field of understanding the various aspects of airport buildings that have been actually used for important purposes. Therefore, a number of studies on air transport management need to be linked to the management of buildings, thereby expanding existing achievements.====This paper presents an intuitive energy benchmark metric for ATBs using both actual data and simulated energy consumption results to reduce possible errors derived from their small number of ATB samples. Section 2 summarizes energy performance indicators and benchmark tools dealing with effective factors and metrics, and proposes an integrated regression model. In Section 3, the proposed model is tested with actual measured data, and shows the result. In Sections 4 Discussion, 5 Conclusion, the model's effectiveness, practical implications and a follow-up study are discussed.","Energy performance analysis of airport terminal buildings by use of architectural, operational information and benchmark metrics",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301310,13 January 2020,2020,Research Article,410.0

The objective of this study is to identify and rank the airport selection criteria of LCCs. Based on reviewing the existing literature, five main factors comprising 16 sub-factors were developed. The factors were first validated by three ","The deregulation of aviation industry in the 1990s has led to a strong development of Low-cost carriers (LCCs), especially in Europe and North America. LCCs are often defined as the airlines that are operated to minimise operating costs and without the conventional in-flight services and amenities (i.e. no-frills), resulting in lower fares and fewer comforts. The traditional business model of LCCs has been well studied (Halpern et al., 2016; Klophaus et al., 2012). Compared to Full-Service Carriers (FSCs), LCCs are often characterised by point-to-point traffic, single aircraft type, use of secondary airport, direct sales of tickets, single class cabin, and no complimentary in-flights services. Due to their price competitiveness, LCCs have not only displaced considerable market share from FSCs, but also stimulated demand from new market segments (Zhang et al., 2008). In fact, about 50% of the intra-European air traffic is served by LCCs in 2014. While the early booming period of the LCC sector has been replaced with a steadier growth in recent years, the sector remains an important part of the aviation industry.====Among others, airport choice is one of the most important factors that determines the success or failure of LCCs (Warnock-Smith and Potter, 2005). In this regard, research has been conducted to identify the airport selection criteria, yet no consensus has been reached regarding their relative rankings. For example, Mason and Morrison (2008) evaluated the attractiveness of airports based on airport cost, airport size, number of competing airlines and monopoly routes, whereas other studies prioritised the criteria such as efficient turnaround facilities, catchment area and proximity to the primary city (Barrett, 2004b; Warnock-Smith and Potter, 2005). Dziedzic and Warnock-Smith (2016a) further suggested that the relative importance of the selection criteria has changed over the years given the fast-evolving business environment.====Indeed, clear distinctions between different airline business models are increasingly hard to formulate considering the dynamic nature of the industry. LCCs are actively modifying their strategies in order to stay competitive by blending low-cost traits with those of FSCs (Klophaus et al., 2012). Notable changes are witnessed within the LCC sector, which include more focus on attracting business travellers (hence moving into primary airports and requiring short flight connections), engaging in code-sharing and even offering long-haul services (De Poret et al., 2015; Halpern et al., 2016). To a certain extent, the LCC sector seems to drift to a hybrid model where factors related to connectivity, convenience and comfort become important considerations in addition to the conventional emphasis on cost and efficiency (Mason and Morrison, 2008). To this end, the traditional LCC business model has evolved as the sector matures. It is thus highly timely to re-examine the airport selection criteria under the current changing context of LCCs.====Furthermore, extant studies predominantly focus on LCCs in Europe and North America, whereas LCCs in Asia are under-investigated (Chang and Lee, 2010; Zhang et al., 2008). As different from those mature markets, LCCs in Asia are only a recent phenomenon due to a much slower pace of deregulation in the region. According to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), there have been many, recent entrants in Asia's LCC market (e.g. 9 Air, Air Seoul, Lucky Air, NokScoot Airlines, Spring Airlines Japan, Thai Viet Jet Air and Trujet). This would raise competition between LCCs operating in Asia. Further, Asia is a fast-developing economic region. The income of Asia's population is increasing, and this would have an impact on passengers' expectation about the services of LCCs and subsequently, their airport selection choices. As a consequence of the above observations, insights generated from prior research may not be applicable to the unique economic, operating and regulatory environment of Asia. To this end, an Asian perspective becomes critical, which is especially true considering the huge growth potential of the Asian aviation market. To overcome the research gap, this study aims to identify and prioritise the airport selection criteria from the perspective of Asian LCCs. Methodology-wise, a Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is applied in order to systematically rank the relatively importance of the selection criteria. The method integrates the fuzzy logic into the conventional AHP technique which allows the researchers to handle vague information based on the experts' judgements to determine priority scales.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. First, extant literature related to the LCC operating models is reviewed, based on which the key airport selection criteria along with the sub-criteria are presented. After elaborating the research method, the results regarding the relative importance of the selection criteria are discussed in detail. It is found that airport charges is the most important criterion, followed by airport performance and airport growth opportunities, whereas the airport infrastructure and catchment area are considered least important.

Designing services that excel in those dimensions is likely to improve the company's performance with customers.","The airline industry operates in a highly competitive market, in which companies have to deal with various challenges to succeed (Calisir et al., 2016; Dolnicar et al., 2011). Examples include oscillating fuel prices, fluctuating demands for service, economic crises, natural disasters, strikes, personnel shortage, restrictive government regulations, and increased security precautions (Calisir et al., 2016; Dolnicar et al., 2011). In such a challenging economic environment achieving and maintaining a high level of passenger satisfaction is seen as a key competitive advantage (Chen, 2008; Li et al., 2017). In that sense, it is important not only to understand how passengers evaluate airlines’ services, but also to identify their most valued dimensions of satisfaction (Park et al., 2004).====Customer satisfaction may be measured by the gap between perceived quality of the product or service, and pre-purchase quality expectations (Chow, 2015; Forgas et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2017). Customers tend to be satisfied with an airline when service quality attributes deemed most important are met or surpassed (Chow, 2015); such attributes represent dimensions of satisfaction (Guo et al., 2017). Several studies state that customer satisfaction plays an important role in motivating customers' behavioral loyalty, which translates into giving positive reviews, returning as customers, or recommending the product or service to others (Forgas et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2017; Mattila, 2004; Morgan and Hunt, 1994). On the other hand, unsatisfied passengers may reconsider using the same airline in future flights (Namukasa, 2013), or start a negative word-of-mouth campaign (which may be electronic) that could cause damage to the company's reputation and image (Blodgett and Li, 2007).====Measuring customer satisfaction in the airline industry is becoming more frequent and relevant (Park et al., 2005); there are at least five reasons for that (Grigoroudis and Siskos, 2009). First, customer satisfaction measurement programs could improve the communication with the clientele. Second, companies may examine whether their services fulfill customers' expectations. Moreover, companies may analyze the impact of specific efforts and actions on the clientele. Third, key satisfaction dimensions that should be improved may be identified. Fourth, companies could identify their strengths and weaknesses against competition, based on customer perceptions and judgments. Finally, companies’ personnel may be motivated to increase their productivity given that all improvement efforts promoted on services are evaluated by customers themselves.====However, since the relationship between service quality dimensions and customer satisfaction may show a nonlinear pattern, assessing customer satisfaction may become a challenging task (Basfirinci and Mitra, 2015). In recent years, different approaches were proposed to identify and measure airline service quality and passenger satisfaction (Tsafarakis et al., 2017). One research stream uses statistical techniques such as regression (e.g. logistic or ordinal) to model the relationship between quality dimensions and customer satisfaction (Ali et al., 2016; Eboli and Mazzulla, 2009; Josephat and Ismail, 2012); another uses Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods and tools to evaluate airlines’ service levels and generate propositions for improvements (Li et al., 2017; Liou et al., 2011; Liou and Tzeng, 2007).====Conventional qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods (e.g. focus groups, questionnaire surveys, or a combination of both) are generally used by researchers and practitioners as an information source to identify and measure customers’ dimensions of satisfaction (Guo et al., 2017). However, these methods are time consuming and often inaccurate (Wan and Gao, 2015). For example, biased conclusions may result from limited sample sizes or inconsistent measurement items and questions (Chow, 2015). Not all customers take questionnaires seriously, and many customers fill them out randomly, bringing noise into analyses (Wan and Gao, 2015). In addition, questions are normally set based on previous research (Guo et al., 2017), compromising the uncovering of subjects not contemplated in questionnaires; e.g. emerging customer preferences (Wan and Gao, 2015).====As an alternative to conventional methods, studies from different fields have shown that user-generated content (UGC) can be used as an information source to understand customer preferences and demands (Chau and Xu, 2012). UGC results from the widespread diffusion of Web 2.0 technologies (Guo et al., 2017), which enabled customers, including those from the airline industry, to share their experiences and opinions. Thousands of customers may share spontaneous, insightful, and passionate online feedback, thereby creating the “wisdom of crowds” (Surowiecki and Silverman, 2007). More important, such feedback is widely available online and easily accessible for free or at low-cost (Guo et al., 2017). One popular form of UGC is online customer reviews (OCRs) (Felbermayr and Nanopoulos, 2016). Usually, OCRs are provided by customers who had direct (and usually recent) experience with a product or service; they are reported in multiple forms including online ratings (e.g. number of stars) and online reviews (e.g. personal opinion in text format) (Flanagin and Metzger, 2013; Jin et al., 2016; Sparks et al., 2016).====The present study aims to explore the “wisdom of crowds” (Surowiecki and Silverman, 2007) contained in thousands of OCRs to provide directions for airlines companies to improve in competitiveness. More specifically, this study aims to: (====) identify and extract dimensions of customer satisfaction expressed in OCRs; (====) verify the distribution and importance of those dimensions in OCRs from different groups of airline customers; (====) identify and extract adjectives used to describe perceptions in those dimensions and calculate the adjectives’ sentiment scores; and (====) test and validate the dimensions and adjectives in (====) through regression analysis. By exploring OCRs, we believe that the “voice of the customer” (Gaskin et al., 1993) will be heard, since those records are written in their own language. OCRs are also organized and prioritized in the way customers think about, use, and interact with airline services.====This article contributes to the state-of-the art on the use of spontaneous generated content to explore dimensions of customer satisfaction in at least three ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify and extract dimensions of customer satisfaction using airline company data. Despite the fact that LDA is considered the principal method to extract latent topics from unstructured texts (Zhao et al., 2015), there is no evidence of using it to analyze customer satisfaction in the airline industry. Second, we propose to expand the scope of data stratification, normally limited to a specific airline and/or a particular online rating system, to include passenger characteristics and preferences (e.g. nationality, type of traveler, and cabin flown). We also propose a temporal stratification of data to enable the analysis of changes in customer demands over time. Third, this study uses a database with over 55,000 OCRs, referring to more than 400 airlines, and passengers from over 170 countries. Compared to previous studies, our data base is much larger allowing more reliable generalizations [e.g. 2,105 tweets in Mostafa (2013), 7,466 OCRs in Yao et al. (2015), 9,238 tweets in Sreenivasan et al. (2012), 10,895 tweets in Liau and Tan (2014), and 12,864 tweets in Wan and Gao (2015)].",Text mining approach to explore dimensions of airline customer satisfaction using online customer reviews,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719302959,27 December 2019,2019,Research Article,412.0

Delay is assigned as the result of the optimisation of a deterministic multi-objective problem considering flight and passenger perspectives when defining objectives of performance and fairness. Two optimisation cases are presented: one where objectives are based on flight metrics, and another one where they are based on passenger metrics. The paper defines and analyses efficiency-fairness trade-offs: the concepts of ==== for flights and passengers are defined as the percentage of efficiency loss due to the consideration in the optimisation of fairness; whereas the ","Airports are limited in capacity by operational constraints (Bazargan et al., 2002; Gilbo, 1993), generating in some cases, a significant imbalance between capacity and demand. Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM) initiatives are then implemented to smooth traffic arrivals, transferring costly airborne delay, carried out with holdings and/or path stretching, to pre-departure on-ground delay (Carlier et al., 2007).====When a capacity-demand imbalance is detected, a Ration by Schedule (RBS) prioritisation of flights is the current practice for slot assignment (EUROCONTROL, 2015a). RBS policy is considered by the different stakeholders to be the fairest delay assignment, since it respects the original slot planning, but economical optimum cannot be guaranteed and only arrival delay is considered. Nevertheless, while airline reported delay was 14.7 min per flight in Europe in 2018, reactionary delay was responsible for ==== of it, heavily influenced by the impact of first-rotation delays (EUROCONTROL, 2019), and should thus not be neglected.====In the current operational environment, the system is optimised considering a flight-centred perspective, however, different stakeholders might experience ATM system performances differently. In particular, passenger-centric metrics might differ from their equivalent flight-centric ones (Cook et al., 2012). In (Montlaur and Delgado, 2017), performances for flight and passenger delays of an extended arrival manager (E-AMAN) were analysed in conjunction with a pre-tactical optimisation of flights. In that work, the assignment of slots was optimised considering either arrival delay for flights, arrival delay for passengers, total delay for flights (considering reactionary delay) or total delay for passengers (considering outbound connections). Results showed that in the scope of an E-AMAN, the distances and possible delays that can be assigned do not justify the application of a more sophisticated strategy than RBS. Nevertheless, when the scope of optimisation was enlarged to include the pre-tactical phase, benefits (and trade-offs) were obtained by optimising the assignment of delay instead of only considering flight schedules. While minimising the total delay for passengers is, as expected, the best strategy from the passengers perspective, it leads to higher reactionary delay for flights with respect to a flight-centric optimisation. Though optimisation carried out in (Montlaur and Delgado, 2017) focused on only one stakeholder at a time and did not include an explicit consideration of equity, it was shown that if focus is given to flight total delay, the benefit per passenger remains similar to the passenger centred optimisation and the variability with respect to the RBS delay assignment was reduced, improving the fairness of the solution.====Equity from a flight perspective was explicitly included in (Montlaur and Delgado, 2018), where flight and passenger delays and equity were conjointly considered in the optimisation scheme. Preliminary conclusions showed how focusing on one objective would affect the two others. The work presented in (Montlaur and Delgado, 2018) focused on the optimisation of three metrics (flight and passenger delays and flight-fairness) at the same time, allowing a better understanding of the trade-offs between performance from a flight delay, passenger delay and flight fairness perspective. The work focused on allowing decision makers to consider informed ==== articulation of preferences when optimising the delay assignment. To that end, the concept of ==== (understood as ====) and ==== as the ones defined in (Bertsimas et al., 2012) were used.====Previous research, focusing on three variables at the same time, lacked some applicability and a definition of fairness for passengers was missing. This paper has three main goals: 1) It considers a classical efficiency-equity trade-off at flight level, which would use easily available data. 2) It then studies the impact on passengers metrics. 3) It finally aims at covering the gap of equity for passengers by suggesting a definition of passenger delay fairness and finally analyses the trade-offs existing between flight and passenger performance and fairness metrics. Note that, during real life operations, the impact of uncertainty would be very relevant as the planned optimisation performed pre-tactically is subject to degradation when tactically realised. This might impact the trade-off between indicators and affect the optimal assignment of slots focusing on the expected outcome, as done for example in (Glover and Ball, 2013). In this paper, however, the assignment of slots is optimised in a deterministic manner since the main objective consists in defining and presenting different metrics. Future work should research the impact of the system's stochasticity on the stability of the solutions.====Section 2 details the background on fairness on delay assignment with an analysis of literature when allocating resources from a fairness point of view. Section 3 first explains the optimisation model and objectives used in this work. It then considers how individual objectives are combined in a multi-objective problem and presents the optimisation cases analysed in the paper. Finally, the consideration of efficiency and fairness trade-off with the concepts of ==== and ==== are described.

The main results (for the multi-objective optimisation and for the performance-fairness trade-offs) and their discussion are reported in Section 5.

Under the influence of the Single European Sky (SES) and Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiatives, national markets for terminal ANS are opening up, and new technologies are being developed. The question arises how European air navigation service providers (ANSPs) should react to the challenges caused by these market changes.====As part of the SES initiative, functional airspace blocks (FABs) were established in an attempt to optimise ANS provision over state boundaries by enhancing cooperation between ANSPs. The ultimate aim as mentioned in the SES framework regulation is to, where appropriate, eventually have one integrated ANSP for a FAB (European Commission, 2004). To date, the FABs seem to be somewhat rigid constructions (European Commission, 2018). However, the consolidation question remains very present in the European ANS industry. The SES II+ package, which is still in the process for approval, aims to further improve efficiency in the sector by partly unbundling terminal from en-route services and fostering industry-led consolidation (European Commission, 2018). An econometric analysis might help policymakers and ANSPs to understand whether such unbundling ==== and consolidation ==== could be economically viable.====To assess possible consolidation strategies, this paper presents the estimates of a multi-product translog cost frontier for the European ANS industry from which measures for economies of scale and scope are derived in the sample means. The paper contributes to the existing literature by using a parametric method to estimate economies of scale, taking into account the multi-product nature of the ANS industry.

However, such process is frequently disrupted by various events, affecting punctuality of airline operations. This paper describes an innovative approach for obtaining an efficient stand assignment considering the stochastic nature of airport environment. Furthermore, the presented methodology combines benefits of Bayesian modelling and metaheuristics for generating solutions that are more robust to airport flight schedule perturbations. In addition, this paper illustrates that the application of the presented methodology combined with simulation provides a valuable tool for assessing the robustness of the developed stand assignment to flight delays.","Modern air transportation industry is encountered with a complex challenge. Air travel demand is rapidly growing every year and is estimated to double over the next two decades. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that the amount of air travellers is expected to reach 8.2 billion travellers by 2037 (IATA, 2018). On the other side, air transport stakeholders are constantly pressured with changing standards and improvements in safety, passenger service and sustainability levels, as well as increasing need for modernisation of facilities.====Emerging technologies and overall demand to smoothen air passenger experience throughout the entire journey creates large investment pressure on airport stakeholders in the short time horizon. However, yet existing capacity constraints have to be also taken into consideration for the future investment areas (Symonds, 2018). If capacity development does not match the speed of traffic growth, congestion and economic problems will appear. Those problems would be a direct consequence of airlines not having access to necessary infrastructure for satisfying the increasing demand for air freight and passenger travel.====Everyday airport operations involve many aircraft and airport resources. Serving arriving aircraft and its passengers, preparing aircraft for departure and embarking its passengers require specific number of resources and corresponding equipment. At many airports these operations are performed by separate ground-handling dedicated companies, so the airport only must provide enough space for required time for making ground-handling possible. Nevertheless, while the number of aircraft passing through an airport grows from season to season, available space at an airport remains the same in most of the situations, thus, increasing the importance of facilities management by airport stakeholders. They must create an assignment schedule for the upcoming operational period, matching the existing parking positions with the requirements of airlines and passengers. However, in reality this assignment plan is often disrupted by deviations from scheduled times of arrival/departure of some flights, making the existing assignment schedule difficult to achieve and creating additional workload on decision-makers to re-make assignment schedule in time-constrained conditions.====In circumstances of limited capacity and high occupancy of terminal facilities, every deviation on arrival or departure time makes necessary to hold aircraft, affected by such deviations, waiting for availability of an appropriate parking position to be served at. This problem can sometimes be avoided by increasing buffer times between consecutive assignments to the same parking facility, however this reduces airport capacity. If the punctuality is disrupted, in the framework of a congested airport and limited airport apron space, it becomes vital to find tools that help to ease the burden of unpunctual arrivals and departures on the rest of daily operations and mitigate the negative impact of operational stochasticity on the terminal capacity planning and scheduling to ensure its robustness.====The existing challenge of congested airports for mitigating the negative effect of arrival and departure delays on stand assignment schedule became a motivation to look for a leveraging methodology in the field of operational research. So, this paper presents a novel methodology for coping with the impact of unpunctual flights on the stand allocation schedule, which allows to benefit from historical data, optimization techniques and simulation for optimising the use of an airport stand capacity, considering the objectives of airport stakeholders and historical flight delays.====As mentioned, this paper focuses on the stand allocation problem (SAP); which refers to the problem of assigning flights to existing parking positions (stands) in such a way that all operational and technical constraints are satisfied. This problem is also called gate allocation problem (GAP). This term differs from SAP only in the definition of main subject: It considers only the gates used by passengers to go from the terminal building into the aircraft during the boarding procedure. In its nature, both SAP and GAP are approached by the same methodologies and are similar to a job-scheduling problem (Taillard, 1993), studied for decades. The complexity of the assignment is directly related to the number of flights to be assigned, which in airport routines can be to over 500 flights and more per day, depending on the size of an airport, which makes SAP/GAP an NP-hard problem due to real-life quantity of constraints and decision variables, such as aircraft size, airline business model, airport policy in stand assignment among others. As the number of flights for large airports can surmount thousand movements per day, the task of allocation becomes very complicated to be solved manually in an efficient way. Thus, for making stand allocation according to all required conditions and avoiding errors, SAP/GAP are often approached to be solved by the means of various algorithms, described in the next section. The article continues in the following way. Section 2 performs the literature review, in Section 3 presents the methodology and a case study is presented in Section 4. Section 5 exemplifies the application of the methodology in the case study and Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses the future work.",A multi-objective optimization with a delay-aware component for airport stand allocation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719302832,28 November 2019,2019,Research Article,416.0

Its total length of high-speed rail (HSR) tracks in operation has been greater than that of all other countries combined since 2012. HSR poses a significant challenge to the Chinese airline ====, especially on major airline routes. The impacts of HSR on two market-competition measures, namely, the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) and the Lerner index, are examined in this study. In general, the entry of HSR had the effect of reducing market power measured by both the unweighted and weighted Lerner indexes. However, the Lerner index and HHI of the routes with parallel HSR services remained consistently higher than those of the routes without parallel HSR services.","China's civil aviation market has become the second largest in the world since 2005 in terms of the volumes of passenger and freight traffic handled in the domestic market. The market share of air transport among all transport modes has been rising steadily. In 1980, the share of air transport was less than 1% in China's inter-city passenger transportation including rail, road, and water measured by revenue passenger kilometers (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2016). However, this figure rose to more than 20% in 2017. The rapid growth is due in part to China's market-oriented reforms in the whole economy and a series of liberalization policies implemented in the air transport sector, which have completely reshaped and transformed the Chinese airline market (e.g., Zhang, 1998; Zhang and Chen, 2003; Zhang and Round, 2009, 2011; Wang et al., 2014).====As with many other countries, the airline industry in China has long been characterized by frequent mergers and acquisitions. The most influential merger events occurred in October 2002, when the central government guided ten state-owned airlines to merge into three large airline groups: Air China, China Eastern Airlines, and China Southern Airlines (known as the “Big Three”). The 2002 airline consolidations have substantially changed the landscape of China's airline industry and had a profound impact on almost all the major airlines. The Chinese domestic aviation market has since been dominated by the Big Three, accounting for over 75% of the market (Zhang et al., 2013). Another event that has had similarly substantial impacts on the air transport sector was the entry of high-speed rail (HSR) into China's transport networks. The first major HSR service was launched in 2008 between Beijing and Tianjin. The impact of HSR has become greater as the length of HSR tracks increases. In 2017 the length of China's HSR tracks amounted to 20,000 km (km), representing by far the largest HSR network in the world (Zhu et al., 2018). It is planned by the central government that China's HSR network will by 2025 reach a total of 38,000 km, including eight north-south and eight east-west trunk lines (Wang et al., 2017). Furthermore, by 2030 China's HSR network is planned to reach 45,000 km in length, and most cities with a population of 500,000 or more will be connected by HSR.====The shock to air transport due to HSR comes from the fact that HSR can be a close substitute for air transport. Wan et al. (2016) found that HSR development has strongly and negatively affected short- and medium-haul air routes in both China and Japan. Zhu et al. (2018) showed that HSR becomes a preferred and dominant option over the air mode on a number of long-distance routes up to 1,300 km. Fu et al. (2015) revealed that to incumbent full-service carriers in China, HSR services impose a much more competitive pressure than do low-cost carriers (LCCs). With the further expansion of the HSR network, there has been a growing body of literature examining the impact of HSR on China's airline industry (e.g., Fu et al., 2012; Yang and Zhang, 2012; Jiang and Zhang, 2016; Zhang and Zhang, 2016; Chen, 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018a). For a recent survey see Zhang et al. (2019). These studies have reported that the shock to air transport due to the presence of HSR is real and material in terms of the impact on air demand and airfares. Wang et al. (2018a) provided both theoretical and empirical evidence showing that the speed of HSR has a larger impact on airline traffic than on airline prices. They also found that more intense competition between airlines can reduce HSR speed effect on airfares. However, little research has explicitly examined how market concentration and market power have changed in China's airline market as a result of the entry of HSR. This research aims to fill this literature gap.====To objectively measure the degree of competition in China's airline industry, both the unweighted Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) and Lerner index and the weighted HHI and Lerner index are, in this study, adopted to measure the competition degree on each air route in the Chinese domestic market. Specifically, this paper will first examine the changing trends of the four competition indicators in China's airline markets including those with and without parallel HSR services. We then employ an econometric model to further analyze the impact of HSR on airline market power proxied by HHI and Lerner index. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Lastly, the final result is integrated by another KELM model incorporating the forecasting results of all components. In order to prove and verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach, the passenger demands of Beijing, Guangzhou and Pudong airports are introduced to test the performance. Also, the experimental results show that the novel approach does have a more obviously advantage than other benchmark models regarding both accuracy and robustness analysis. Therefore, this approach can be utilized as a convincing tool for the air passenger demand forecasting.","Air transport is a complex system that includes aircraft, airports, flight routes and air traffic management systems, and it plays an extremely important role in transportation industry, and also in the social and economic development. In the airline industry, air passenger demand forecasting is an essential element for airport managers to make opportune operation plans (Kim and Shin, 2016). Air transportation requires long-term demand forecasts to develop long-term operational plans, such as the opening of new routes, airport construction and layout, reducing flight costs and adjusting ticket prices, meanwhile, it is also necessary to pay more attention to the immediate short-term demand forecasts in the purpose of airport scheduling, quarterly operating plans, and short-term maintenance and inspection plans (Tsui et al., 2014). In view of the huge workload of airport construction and the situation that is difficult to change after completion, the accurate forecasting of airport demand is extremely important for its construction, investment and management (Flyvbjerg et al., 2005). However, it is a very challenging work to forecast passenger demand due to its multiple characteristics, such as irregularity, high volatility and non-stationarity (Xiao et al., 2014).====To address this issue, some scholars have paid gradually close attention to the air passenger flow demand forecasting research (Sun et al., 2019). All kinds of models have been built up to forecast passenger demand, the prediction methods can be classified into three categories: economic models, time series models and artificial intelligence methods (Dantas et al., 2017). The economic methods focus on the correlation between the passenger demand and multiple variables, which are regarded as the influence of changes in the economic environment and the traffic system, and then the forecasting models are established via a host of equations. The used commonly economic models include regression analysis (Abed et al., 2001), causality test (Fernandes and Pacheco, 2010), logit model (Garrow and Koppelman, 2004), gravity model (Grosche et al., 2007), which perform better in a relatively stable application environment (Xiao et al., 2014). The time series methods rely mainly on historical data to predict by mining the intrinsic relationship between current data and past observations series. The various time series models have been used to forecast passenger demand, such as smoothing techniques (Samagaio and Wolters, 2010; Williams et al., 1998), adapted Markov model(Chin and Tay, 2001), ARIMA/SARIMA (Tsui et al., 2014), gray theory (Hsu and Wen, 2000), seasonal adjustment method (Aston and Koopman, 2006), and Holt-Winters (Segura and Vercher, 2007), etc. As we all know, the causal economic model is more suitable for using multiple influencing factors to analyze the long-term or short-term relationship between a specific factor and passenger demand through statistics such as cointegration test and Granger causality test (Baker et al., 2015). In addition, although the time series model has obvious advantages in dealing with nonlinear and unstable series, it is susceptible to the change of internal parameters of the system (Xiao et al., 2014). As a fact, the air passenger demand series has been confirmed to be subject to several factors that make it nonstationary at level value, for instance, economic growth (GDP), regional resources, revenue and so on (Hakim and Merkert, 2016).====On account of the non-linear characteristic of passenger demand, the economic and time series approaches are criticized severely due to their limited and poor effective forecasting ability (Tsui et al., 2014). Fortunately, with the development of information technology, academic researchers and business practitioners try to explore artificial intelligence forecasting algorithms, which are characterized with self-adaption and non-linearity, and have the ability to map arbitrary function(Zhang et al., 1998). By adjusting the weights online, these methods can approximate the arbitrary nonlinear function to an expected accuracy, and capture the inherently complex, dynamic and nonlinear characteristics in the data, as well. Therefore, the artificial intelligence approach possesses usually higher forecasting accuracy than that of both the econometric models and the time series ones. Till now, the research results on artificial intelligence models are flourish in many aspects, for example multilayer perceptron neural networks (Smith and Demetsky, 1997; Van Arem et al., 1997; Lee et al., 2006), Kalman filter (Vythoulkas, 1993), time-delay neural networks (Zhang, 2000), radial basis function neural networks (Zheng et al., 2006), the support vector machine for regression (Castro-Neto et al., 2009), Elman neural network (Elman) (Hao and Tian, 2019), and extreme learning machine (ELM) (Li et al., 2018). Currently, this kind of artificial intelligence algorithms have been developed in various forecasting areas, including passenger demands forecasting (Xiao et al., 2014), wind speed forecasting (Zhao et al., 2016) electricity price forecasting (Wang et al., 2016), etc. They have been identified as a valid prediction methods with strong robustness and fault tolerance.====Since most passenger demand forecasting models have their own advantages and disadvantages, none of them can always obtain the desired forecasting results. For instance, the economic models and the time series ones are extremely simple in structure, which require only endogenous variables without the need of other exogenous variables. But the drawbacks of them are a poor extrapolation effect, a narrow forecasting range and a strong dependence on data, so that, they are more beneficial to forecast linear data rather than for the irregular and nonstationary data (Yang et al., 2017). On the other hand, artificial intelligence models can deal with multiple variables and non-linear problems, while the settings of input-output structure and parameters are primarily dependent on the experience of the researchers. These limited parts of the non-linear input-output relationship may lead to their unsatisfactory prediction accuracy (Li et al., 2014). In addition, some other shortcomings connected with the artificial intelligence models are over fitting, slow learning speed, and the high probability of entrapment in local minimum.====In fact, numerous factors, such as the economic development, policy adjustments and seasonal cycles, will affect the demand of air passengers. Furthermore, with the implementation of the low-altitude opening strategy, the uncontrollable and unpredictable emergencies increase the difficulty of accurate passenger demand forecasting. The single econometric approaches and the artificial intelligence models can not meet the requirements of all the aviation management participators in terms of error and accuracy. To further enhance the predictive capability of the models, the novel hybrid approach is an excellent option in which it combines creatively the forecasting models with some different characteristics and is capable of capturing the intrinsic features in the original data and improving the forecasting accuracy. Therefore, many researchers have been making efforts to process the volatility and the noise existed in the data series by adopting different data pre-processing techniques before forecasting. For instance, several decomposition approaches have been incorporated into the hybrid model to identify and extract the main characteristics of nonlinear series, including singular spectral analysis (SSA) (Xiao et al., 2014), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) (Shao et al., 2015) and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) (Pei et al., 2017). For example, a new hybrid model was developed for short-term passenger demand forecasting, which consists of singular spectrum analysis (SSA), adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO) (Xiao et al., 2014). The results confirm that the established model is able to estimate satisfactorily changes in the future passenger demand. Similarly, Xie et al. proposed a hybrid approaches for short-term passenger demand forecasting(Xie et al., 2014). The experiment analysis demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model perform better than other competitive models, and indicate that it is a prospective tool to forecast the complex time series with high volatility and nonlinearity. Therefore, it can be concluded that, in previous studies, the forecasting results of the hybrid model are outperformed usually the single model.====At the same time, the common decomposition methods, such as EMD and EEMD, are sensitive to signal noise and sampling. Dragomiretskiy and Zosso proposed a variational mode decomposition method (VMD) in 2014 to address these problems, which is a novel non-recursive time-frequency analysis technique (Dragomiretskiy and Zosso, 2014). The VMD can adaptively decompose the original signal into a series of quasi-orthogonal modes(Wang et al., 2015). So far, the VMD decomposition method has been introduced into some prediction fields. For example, Zhu et al. proposed a hybrid forecasting approach incorporating VMD, the mode reconstruction (MR) with the optimal combined forecasting model (CFM) to forecast carbon price series (Zhu et al., 2019). The empirical results display that the proposed model is superior to competitive models in some statistical measures and robustness. Lahmiri presented a new time series approach to forecast the economic and financial time series, which are in link with VMD and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) (Lahmiri, 2016). The performance of the model is appraised by comparing the prediction results of the VMD-GRNN model and the EMD-GRNN model, and the analysis illustrate that the VMD is an efficient and meritorious signal analysis technology. In this paper, the variational mode decomposition model (VMD) is utilized as a data pre-processing strategy to obtain the characteristic information of different scales of the original series.====However, the data information in the real life (such as the air passenger demand) involves a rather complex internal structure, which can hinder the artificial intelligence models from obtaining the more complex behavior patterns in the original time series. The previous studies have emphasized the significance of data decomposition as a pre-processing technology, and present that the decomposition can obviously improve the forecasting performance of the approach. But these studies may ignore the unique trait of each component such as the frequency range of the signal and the stability of the modes. By the analysis of the above literatures, this research proposes a novel hybrid approach (VMD-ARMA/KELM-KELM) as follows: (1) The VMD is used to decompose the passenger demand series into several subsequences. (2) By testing the stability of each decomposition mode, the autoregressive moving average model is applied to forecast stable subseries, and the non-stationary sequence is predicted by the kernel extreme learning machine. (3) The forecasting results of ARMA model and KELM are integrated into one final result. To illustrate the performance of the proposed approach, the air passenger demand of Beijing and Guangzhou airports are calculated and compared with other competitive approaches. Meanwhile, the study also adopts the air passenger demand data of Shanghai Pudong airport to confirm the robustness of the proposed approach. The empirical analysis exhibits that the proposed hybrid approach is superior to other competitive approaches, which is an efficient and meritorious tool in air transport demand forecasting and can be identified as a reliable alternative. The proposed approach in this paper integrates the advantages of various methods and technologies, and overcomes data complexity caused by different factors, which can completely capture and learn the intrinsic characteristics in the original air passenger demand. Simultaneously, it can greatly improve the forecasting performance and obtain more reliable results. Consequently, the most accurate forecasting results can provide some strong and effective references and advices for the operation and the construction in the aviation industry.====The remainder of this research is arranged as follows. Section 2 describes the framework and developing process of the hybrid forecasting approach in detail, and all kinds of evaluation criteria.

In addition to these findings, both reading of passenger needs and WENG partly mediate the relationship between boreout and SOOCBs. The findings based on the use of the phantom variables suggest that WENG is a more proximal variable to SOOCBs than reading of passenger needs in the association between boreout and SOOCBs. In view of the abovementioned findings, our study offers implications for practice within the penultimate part of the paper.","In today's competitive business environment, service companies need to have a pool of talented employees who can deliver quality services to customers, find solutions to problems/failures, and achieve customer satisfaction and loyalty. This is so important for the aviation industry where according to the International Air Transport Association, the number of passengers is expected to go up to 4.3 billion in 2018 (Cheng et al., 2018a). Under these conditions, airline companies should center on retention of talented cabin attendants who can display the aforementioned intended outcomes (cf. Chen et al., 2019; Farooq et al., 2018; Medina-Muňoz et al., 2018; Tsafarakis et al., 2018).====Cabin attendants who have frequent interactions with passengers should read passengers' needs to boost a good relationship with them and achieve passenger satisfaction (Ho and Wu, 2019). According to Donavan et al. (2004), reading customers' needs refers to “…the employee's desire to pick up on customers' verbal and nonverbal communication” (p. 132). Not surprisingly, customer-contact employees should pay particular attention to reading the needs of customers using verbal and nonverbal communication (Lages and Piercy, 2012). When employees prioritize customer interests as a result of reading their needs, they can contribute to the organizational performance by displaying high levels of service-oriented organizational citizenship behaviors (SOOCBs). SOOCBs which are represented by loyalty, participation, and service delivery enable employees to promote the company to outsiders, carry out their tasks with uncommonly few mistakes, and provide suggestions for service improvement (Bettencourt et al., 2001).====In addition, work engagement (WENG) which is manifested through vigor, dedication, and absorption (Schaufeli et al., 2006) is a motivational variable triggering employees’ extra-role performance, innovative service behavior, customer-oriented organizational citizenship behaviors, or SOOCBs (Cheng et al., 2018b; Lyu et al., 2016; Stock et al., 2017). It appears that in a service environment where customer-contact employees or cabin attendants are work-engaged and are able to have an accurate reading of customer needs, management expects its employees to exhibit positive performance outcomes. However, cabin attendants who attend to a jillion passengers annually (Hu et al., 2017) are plagued with role stress, passenger misbehaviors, frequent and irregular shifts, work pressure, and emotional dissonance (Cheng et al., 2018b; Karatepe and Eslamlou, 2017; Vatankhah and Darvishi, 2018). Such employees may suffer from boreout, which “is a negative psychological state of low arousal and is represented by three indicators such as crisis of meaning at work, job boredom, and crisis of growth” (Stock, 2015, p. 574). Employees who experience boreout at elevated levels find their work meaningless (crisis of meaning at work), are unable to concentrate on their tasks (job boredom), and are devoid of the chance to learn new things and achieve their goals associated with personal growth and development (crisis of growth) (Stock, 2015, 2016).",Investigating the selected consequences of boreout among cabin crew,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719302194,11 November 2019,2019,Research Article,420.0

This research proposes a practical methodology for investigating the inherent patterns of the relationships between air-traffic volume and ,"With the advance of economic globalization, the volume of air traffic – comprising the carriage of both passengers and freight – has emerged as closely interrelated with regional economic development (Matsumoto, 2004; Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008; Yamaguchi, 2008; Miller and Clarke, 2007). A better understanding of the mechanisms that link air-traffic volume to macroeconomic factors would, therefore, equip policymakers to arrive at more informed policy and strategy decisions regarding airports, airlines and related entities. A considerable body of research has estimated or forecasted air-traffic volumes over both the short and long term, and/or has explored the relations between air traffic and urban development, and this has yielded a variety of demand-forecasting models for both air passengers and cargo (Grosche et al., 2007; Suryani et al., 2010; Tsui et al., 2014). However, air-traffic volume is potentially influenced by an immense array of factors, most of which are to some extent stochastic, so such models do not always perform satisfactorily due to the limited number of factors each one of them takes into account. Meanwhile, those researchers who have explicitly focused on linkages between air-traffic volume and such macroeconomic factors as employment, trade volume and national income (Brueckner, 2003; Dobruszkes et al., 2011) have mainly focused on a handful of suspected factors from their own subfields. In short, the complexity of the issues at hand has rendered it difficult in practice for researchers to consider all the relevant variables. However, the present paper argues that doing so is both necessary and possible.====Specifically, this study aims to uncover the inherent relationship between air-traffic volume and macroeconomic environment, using algorithmic data-mining techniques such as K-means clustering and decision-tree classification to determine the critical macroeconomic factors in this relationship from among an unprecedentedly wide range of potential macroeconomic factors, using the case of Taiwan from 2001 to 2014. After identifying the critical macroeconomic factors, an air-traffic volume forecasting model is developed to validate the effectiveness of the identified critical factors as predictive variables, with the data of Taiwan from 2015 to 2016. The results are expected to be useful in strategy formulation, operations management, and investment-program decisions by governments, airports, airlines, and related entities.",A practical approach to determining critical macroeconomic factors in air-traffic volume based on K-means clustering and decision-tree classification,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301097,11 November 2019,2019,Research Article,421.0

The market share of LCA has grown unprecedentedly across the globe expanding in Europe, Oceania, South America, Asia and Australia. The rise of the LCA has make it necessary for the aviation industry to adapt and accommodate their specific needs. During the initial rise of the LCA, many secondary airports emerged to satisfy their specific needs for simple, affordable and uncongested facilities leading to the emergence of the ‘Low-Cost Airport’ whereas the primary airport was specifically dedicated to the legacy airlines. As the LCA became mature they began to operate from larger airports and at the same time, legacy airlines modified their business model and operational strategies to reduce cost as a response to increased competition from LCA while operating from larger airports. This led the primary airports to address the need of both legacy and low-cost carriers (De Neufville, 2008). Hence, the current situation, both low cost and primary airports need to integrate the requirements of LCA into their service offerings.====Southwest Airlines initiated the LCA model in 1970 and became one of the most successful business models in the airline industry, earning consecutive profits for 45 years as of 2017 and bringing unparalleled offerings to passengers and the economy as a whole (Anon, 2018). The first LCA in Thailand, One Two Go, owned by Oriental Thai airlines started its operations in December 2003 (Charoensettasilp, 2013). Thai Air Asia, jointly owned by Air Asia (Malaysia) and Shin Corp (Thailand), as the second LCA in Thailand in February 2004. Later Solar Air and Happy Air joined as LCA in Thailand. Nok Air, a subsidiary of Thai Airways International, began operating as a LCA in July 2004 (Pandey, 2016). Later in 2009, Thai Smile, a second subsidiary of Thai Airways International, started its operations as a LCA (Qin, 2012). LCA in Thailand contribute 47% of total passenger traffic in 2017 at the six major Airports of Thailand (AOT) airports (CAPA, 2018). The LCA have tripled in terms of available seat kilometer (ASK) offering on Thailand domestic routes in the period 2014–2017 (CAPA, 2018).====Eventually, the increasing traffic of LCA made it necessary for airports to have an understanding of their specific needs and to integrate them into their design parameters. The specific understanding of the actual requirements of LCA would help the airport operators to render the customized service to the growing market segment of LCA in the air transport industry. This paper aims to evaluate the strategic design parameters of the Low-Cost airport in Thailand and whether they meet the service expectations of Low-Cost Airlines. The study utilizes the Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making Method (MCDM) to evaluate how well the service needs of LCA have met the expectations of LCA. Fuzzy-Quality of Function Deployment (QFD) has been employed to integrate the expectations of LCA into the technical design parameters of the studied airport rendering an evaluated design parameter of the studied airport.====The article is subsequently presented in the following sections.

The increasing relevance of the research field at large has been fueled by the observation that both the size and the impact of air transport has been increasing over the past decades (Air Transport Action Group, 2008; Ishutkina and Hansman, 2008). For example, passenger numbers have been soaring, more than tripling from 1.025 billion in 1990 to 3.227 billion passengers in 2017 worldwide (International Civil Aviation Organization, 2017), with IATA forecasting these numbers to double again by 2036 (International Air Transport Association, 2016). Against this backdrop, researchers have sought to better understand the impact and evolution of air transport, including new and better ways of modeling air transport networks and their many effects.====One of the most critical challenges in air transport research is the uneven availability and formatting of data (e.g. Derudder and Witlox, 2005). While there has been a growth and diversification in data collection strategies over the past few years (Poorthuis and Zook, 2017), air transport researchers still face a limited choice of data sources that may or may not provide information in the desired format and/or detail. When zooming in on researching air transport networks in and of themselves, there are two options. The first option is to build a database from scratch, which in this day and age most often entails collecting web-based air travel data. This can either be done by (1) using or developing a web Application Programming Interface (API) to access a meta-search engine or online route planner and/or by (2) ‘screen-scraping’ online route planners or meta-search engines (e.g. Grubesic and Zook, 2007). The second option is to use primary datasets and the tools provided to access them. This varies from freely available raw data to sometimes quite expensive databases with bespoke analytical and visualization tools as well as structured APIs (e.g. Google Flights and the Official Airline Guide (OAG) data). There are a small number of exceptions to this bifurcation between freely available versus commercial databases, e.g. the international section of the DB1B database (Bureau of Transport Statistics, 2018), an extra dataset detailing international flights to and from the US. Although in principle freely available, there are some of the restrictions to its usage, such as the requirement of being an US citizen to access the dataset.====In this paper, our focus will be on publicly accessible and arguably some of the most widely used primary air transport datasets: the data provided by the United States Bureau of Transport Statistics (BTS), and its Origin Destination Survey (DB1B) in particular. Analyses based on the DB1B datasets are geographically circumscribed in that – with the exception of the above-mentioned information detailing international flights to and from the US – the data are restricted to information on domestic flights departing from/arriving at United States airports. In addition, the DB1B dataset is a 10% sample of reported tickets rather than a full dataset. In spite of this focus on a sample of US-centered flights, the importance of the DB1B dataset in air transport research cannot be underestimated (Mao et al., 2015; Neal, 2010, 2014; Seshadri et al., 2007). There are two reasons for this. First, the data ‘feeds’ parts of some of the other well-known datasets. For example, in the case of the OAG, the DB1B data is used by drawing on the following simple method: “DB1B is a 10% sample of an airline's tickets, then ‘adjusted’ to estimate 100% of the market by multiplying the data by a factor of 10” (OAG, 2015). Second, the detailed info and the consistent way in which data are gathered make the BTS datasets ideal for air transport research. For example, Neal (2010) uses BTS data to provide an overview of the use of air traffic networks for urban research by building models of urban-economic flows. Later, he extended this work by differentiating air traffic networks by scale, species and season (Neal, 2014). Fuellhart et al. (2013) and Brueckner et al. (2014) use BTS data to analyze multi-airport regions (MARs) in the US, disentangling the geographies of offer and demand in these MARs. Brownstein et al. (2006) and Colizza et al. (2007) use BTS data to study epidemiological networks as these are increasingly undergirded by air transport movements.====Irrespective of the diversity of the topics addressed in these and in many other papers, it is clear that one of the drawing cards of the BTS sample as well as other major primary datasets is their alleged ‘ground truth’. However, few of the data providers offer detailed info about how their data are sampled and treated. The data quality is therefore sometimes taken to be self-evident. The OAG (2019), for example, self-advertises as “the world's most comprehensive and accurate real-time travel data” without disclosing further details on data collection, treatment and validation. Furthermore, to date there has been little scrutiny of the alleged quality of these datasets (Boyd and Crawford, 2012; Poorthuis and Zook, 2017). The few data quality reports that have been provided tend to be published by the data providers themselves (Strohmeier et al., 2015; Zaveri et al., 2012), with a noteworthy example being a BTS 2005 report on aviation data modernization (US Department of Transportation & Office of the Secretary, 2005). The report determined that 69% of city pairs reported by the DB1B did not meet the Department's accuracy criteria when using enplanement statistics as a validation benchmark. Although this does not necessarily imply that there is a data integrity or structural bias problem with the DB1B data, it does raise questions about how accurate the data are and what the nature of possible biases might be. Because the implications of using inaccurate data may be profound, it is of key importance for air transport researchers to map and understand such possible biases in these datasets.====The purpose of this paper is to explore how potential biases in air transport datasets can be ====. Although investigating the ==== and ==== of these potential biases would be an equally relevant endeavor, this is a more difficult task. Analyzing the sources of biases would require insight into the data collection and processing, but this is complicated because data and their treatment are protected by privacy laws. Meanwhile, assessing the impact of biases on air transport research findings would involve complex issues associated with research replicability and reproducibility. Bearing these limitations in mind, our paper specifically focuses on the (lack of) accuracy of the data rather than on the nature and consequences of these potential biases.====To this end, we develop a methodology that allows identifying possibly biased routes in datasets in an automated manner. Although our focus will be on validating the DB1B data, we present our methodology as a more generic approach that can be used in different contexts and applied to different datasets. To this end, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We start by outlining four important factors to consider when working with both the DB1B database and the Air Carrier Statistics (T-100) database (which we use to validate the DB1B database): collection, representation, inter-mutability and nomenclature. We then use descriptive statistics to describe these DB1B and T-100 databases, and propose a Jaccard-like index to identify biased routes. We conclude by demonstrating how route/database biases can impact research by means of a number of straightforward case studies, focusing on our understanding of the position of routes/airports in air transport networks. In a concluding section, we explain how this approach can be adapted to serve as a more generic tool for assessing route bias in air transport datasets.","Revealing route bias in air transport data: The case of the Bureau of Transport Statistics (BTS), Origin-Destination Survey (DB1B)",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301929,7 November 2019,2019,Research Article,423.0

We propose a generic assessment of such strategic schedules using predictions about arrival/departure flight delays and cancellations. We demonstrate our approach for strategic flight schedules in the period 2013–2018 at London Heathrow Airport. Together with the development of dedicated strategic flight schedule optimization models, our proposed approach supports an integrated strategic flight schedule assessment, where schedules are evaluated with respect to flight delays and cancellations.","The continuous growth of air traffic, together with limited airport expansion possibilities, have resulted in air traffic demand-capacity imbalances and arrival/departure flight delays at the largest airports in Europe. As an example, in 2017, the number of flights in Europe has increased by ==== relative to 2016 (EUROCONTROL, 2017). This corresponds to an additional 1191 flights per day on average. At the same time, ==== of the flights in 2017 experienced an arrival delay of 15min or more (EUROCONTROL, 2017).====To manage the demand-capacity imbalances, the busiest European airports make use of administrative demand management strategies to limit the number of flights scheduled to arrive/depart during busy hours. The main administrative demand management strategy currently in use is the airport slot allocation process, which follows the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Worldwide Slot Guidelines (International Air Transport Association, 2017). The IATA slot allocation process takes place two times per year (the Winter and the Summer season) and gives airlines the permission to use the full range of an airport's infrastructure to arrive or depart at a specific date and time at the airport (Zografos et al., 2017; Pellegrini et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2018). provide a detailed overview of the slot allocation process. This process is managed by airport coordinators. The main input of the slot allocation process at an airport are 1) the requests of the airlines to access an airport's infrastructure for arrival or departure at a specific date and time, and 2) a deterministic, pre-defined airside and terminal capacity of the airport in terms of, for instance, maximum number of movements per day, per hour and per 15min. Following the IATA guidelines, the output of the slot allocation process is a strategic flight schedule containing the scheduled arrival and departure flight date and time up to 6 months prior to the day of the flight execution. The strategic schedule is in the form of a series of scheduled arrival and departure times. These series are commonly recurrent over a period of time, e.g., flight 123 is scheduled to arrive at 10AM every day from Monday to Thursday, in the months April and May.====In the past decade, several optimization models to allocate slots to arriving/departing flights, have been proposed (Zografos et al., 2012; Ribeiro et al., 2018). have developed optimization models for slot allocation at a single European airport. Network-wide slot allocation optimization models have been developed by (Castelli et al., 2012; Corolli et al., 2014; Pellegrini et al., 2017). The main objective of these models is to minimize the difference between the airlines’ slot requests and the slots granted at the airport, following the IATA guidelines and taking into account the declared capacity limits of the airport. However, these models assume ideal conditions: the flights are assumed to be able to arrive and depart exactly within their scheduled slots, and the capacity of the airport is considered to be fixed, deterministic. In the day of the execution, however, flights often experience arrival/departure delays or cancellations. The strategic flight schedules, currently obtained following optimization of the slots requests and the IATA guidelines up to 6 month prior to the day of the flight execution, do not give an indication on the potential flight delays and cancellations associated. In turn, the actual impact of the strategic schedules on the airport on-time performance is unknown at the moment of schedule generation. To address this, a methodology is needed to assess strategic flight schedules with respect to potential flight delays and cancellations and to provide airports with insights into potential performance bottlenecks. Such insights are particularly important to support the airport coordinators in developing strategic schedules that not only meet the IATA guidelines, but also enable a smooth and robust air traffic that benefits both airlines, airports and passengers.====In this paper we propose a machine learning-based approach to assesses the impact of strategic, IATA guidelines-compliant flight schedules on the on-time performance at an airport. In particular, we propose classification algorithms to predict whether flights scheduled in the strategic phase (6 months prior to the day of the execution) are subject to arrival/departure delays and cancellations during execution. Using the obtained flight delay and cancellation results, we propose a generic methodology to rank the strategic schedules by comparing and contrasting the associated flight delay and cancellation predictions. This analysis provides a means to assess strategic schedules based on their predisposition to have flight delays and cancellations. We demonstrate our assessment methodology using 10 strategic flight schedules from 2013 to 2018 at London Heathrow Airport (LHR), which is one of the busiest airports in Europe. To the best of our knowledge, in this paper we address for the first time the assessment of strategic fight schedules with respect to potential flight delays and cancellations.====The main contribution of this paper is that it provides a generic assessment of strategic flight schedules, at the moment when they are generated, using KPIs derived from predictions on flight delays and cancellations. The generality of our proposed assessment relies on the fact that we use a relative performance comparison between the assessed strategic schedules, rather than assigning user-defined weights to the target KPIs. Thus, we assess, using a generic methodology, the robustness of strategic, IATA-compliant flight schedules with respect to delays and cancellations. Together with the development of dedicated optimization models that aim to satisfy airlines’ requests for slots in the presence of airport capacity constraints, our approach provides the airport coordinators with an integrated assessment of the performance of the IATA-compliant, airport slot allocation process.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses existing machine learning approaches for flight delay and cancellation predictions and their performance. Section 3 describes the flight schedules and the flight delay and cancellation data from LHR in the period 2013–2018. Section 4 presents our proposed machine learning approach for flight delay and cancellation classification. Section 5 describes a generic approach to assess strategic flight schedules based on KPIs that are derived in Section 4 using machine learning-based predictions for flight delay and cancellation.

This study aims to examine the connection between airport reward programs and customers' behavioural intentions of visiting the airport, attempting to bring some benefits and credits for implementing reward programs in the airport sector by using Singapore Changi Airport as a case study. Two types of customer behavioural intentions (i.e. time spent at the airport and various purposes of visiting the airport) were investigated in the study to examine the effects of Changi Airport's reward program (i.e. Changi Rewards). An on-line survey was conducted, and the participants' responses were analysed via a ==== approach. The results showed that the attractive benefits of Changi Rewards could have a positive influence on arousing customers' intentions to engage with the programme. In addition, customers' intentions to engage with the programme can have a positive effect on increasing passengers' time spent at the airport and inducing customers to visit the airport for leisure purposes. Managerial implications to the airport sector are discussed.","It is generally accepted that the airport business can be sorted into aeronautical operations (which include aircraft landing and parking, passenger services, etc.) and non-aeronautical activities (such as shopping concessions, restaurants, car parking, and other entertainment facilities) (e.g. Graham, 2013; Perng et al., 2010; Zhang and Zhang, 1997). However, it seems to be increasingly difficult for airports to control the level of their aeronautical charges because of intensified competition in the airline sector, continually changing customer behaviour, the emergence of low-cost carriers, rising security costs, and continuing governmental, economic, regulatory and legal requirements (e.g. Freathy, 2004; Fuerst and Gross, 2018; Graham, 2009, 2013). As a consequence, the majority of airports have been forced to shift their attention from obtaining revenue from traditional aeronautical sources to commercial sources (e.g. Edwards, 2005; Lu, 2014; Morrison, 2009), which has also resulted in the transformation of airports’ role from purely functioning as transportation nodes becoming commercial hubs (Fasone et al., 2016; Kasarda, 2008). Such circumstances can be seen in many modern international airports such as Singapore Changi Airport, Korea Incheon International Airport and London Heathrow Airport.====In the face of fierce competition characterising the airport sector, there is no question regarding the importance of optimising non-aeronautical revenue in airport operations all around the world (e.g. Del Chiappa et al., 2016; Fasone et al., 2016; Graham, 2009, 2013; Yokomi et al., 2017). Many airports, particularly modern international airports, have exerted lots of effort in expanding their non-transport services and facilities to transform the airport from a simple venue for air transportation services to a commercial hub offering a great variety of commercial activities such as terminal-based shopping malls, duty-free stores, entertainment facilities (cinemas, gyms and saunas), cultural attractions (museums and exhibitions) and restaurants. It is almost certain that these investments have become a valuable and primary income source for every airport (e.g. Geuens et al., 2004; Graham, 2009; Han et al., 2015; Lin and Chen, 2013a, 2013b; Lu, 2014; Perng et al., 2010). Meanwhile, passengers might not be the sole customer group that could benefit from the enhanced airport commercial offerings, since a broader range of potential customers (local residents) may also make frequent use of these commercial and retail facilities (e.g. Freathy and O'Connell, 2000; Fuerst and Gross, 2018; Geuens et al., 2004; Graham, 2009; Jarach, 2001; Kasarda, 2008).====Along with the commercialisation of the airport sector, airport management teams have been continually seeking opportunities to increase their customers' expenditure and spending at the airport so as to maximise profits. Prior research has revealed that a loyalty or reward program is a practical marketing tool for cultivating, developing and retaining loyal passengers to help firms secure closer relationships with customers in today's highly competitive and profit-oriented environment, as well as to increase the possible share of their customers' budget and purchases (e.g. Butscher, 2002; Carlsson and Löfgren, 2006; Mimouni-Chaabane and Volle, 2010; So et al., 2015). Airport managers worldwide have therefore put greater emphasis on loyalty marketing. Reward programs are popular in various types of businesses (e.g. hotels, airlines and retail stores), particularly among airlines (these are known as frequent flyer programs) (e.g. Berman, 2006; Dekay et al., 2009; Dorotic et al., 2012; Klemperer, 1995; Lederman, 2007; Lemon and Wangenheim, 2009; Liu et al., 2000; Martín et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2015). Given the fact that reward programs have been widely implemented by the airline industry, it is somewhat surprising that reward programs have not been given enough attention by airport managers. Only a limited number of airports have already incorporated reward programs into their daily operations, such as Singapore Changi Airport (Changi Rewards), London Heathrow Airport (Heathrow Rewards) and Auckland Airport (Strata Club).====In the air transport literature, little attention has been paid to airport reward programs. For example, Wittmer and Maurer (2015) conducted a customer survey at a regional airport in Switzerland (EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg) to test the attractiveness of airport reward program benefits to passengers. The findings suggested that some customers are attracted by the program's benefits (e.g. priority check-in, shopping and dining discounts) but there are many customers whose awareness of the airport reward program was still extremely low. However, these results were based upon data collected from a regional European airport. To the best knowledge of the author, no other study can be found about the effect of airport reward programs on customers' behavioural intentions of visiting the airport.====Based on the fact mentioned above, this study aims to contribute to the air transport literature by offering a better understanding of this less-studied area, with an in-depth analysis of Singapore Changi Airport's reward program as a case study. It is believed that there are two key customers' behavioural intentions to Changi Airport's reward program: (1) the passengers' time spent at Changi Airport and (2) the customers' purposes of visiting Changi Airport. These two responses were applied to evaluate the effect of reward programs on customers' behavioural intentions of visiting the airport for two reasons. Firstly, there is a strong possibility that air passengers make more purchases at the airport if their waiting time is long enough (Bohl, 2014; Castillo-Manzano, 2010). Secondly, the purposes of visiting the airport have not received enough attention in the air transport literature because people were tacitly believed to go to airports solely for travel-related purposes (e.g. taking flights, picking up friends and relatives, etc.), except for Freathy and O'Connell (1998) who noted that some airports had developed landside shopping malls on purpose so as to attract local residents' visit for non-travel purposes. Indeed, many airports in recent years have been transformed to airport shopping malls, indicating that there is a chance that people will go to airports for leisure-oriented purposes (e.g. shopping, dining, etc.) only. Such being the case, this study will focus on two research questions:====To the best knowledge of the author, this study is the first to explore the effects of reward programs on customers' behavioural intentions in the context of international hub airports. Based on the analysis of Changi Airport, this study can contribute to the existing air transport literature regarding loyalty programs in the airport sector. Another important reason that makes this study meaningful is its managerial implications, helping airport managers deepen their knowledge about the effect of airport reward programs on customers' behavioural intentions of visiting the airport which may also cause the changes in airport retail revenue (non-aeronautical revenue). More importantly, a sound understanding of the relationship between airport reward programs and customers' behavioural intentions of visiting the airport will assist airport management teams to assess the benefits and practicality of introducing airport reward programs, and it may also help shape airports’ retailing operational strategies.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature on reward programs, airport reward programs and airport retailing. Section 3 describes Singapore Changi Airport's reward program (Changi Rewards). Section 4 presents the research model and methodology used in this study. Section 5 presents the results of the study.

The literature on airport performance measurement is extensive but has tended to focus mainly on estimating the effects on efficiency from what are mostly endogenous variables. We undertake a two-stage analysis of 59 international airports observations in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. The first stage involves the use of ==== (DEA) to measure the efficiency of these airports. This is followed by a second stage, where we use a Truncated Regression model that incorporates the Simar and Wilson bootstrapping technique to test the extent to which a set of macro-environmental factors affect airport efficiency. Results reveal that a state's air transport sector output, institutional quality and robustness, the macro-economic environment, safety and security, and human development, all have a significant influence on the performance of airports. The result of this study fills the gap in the literature related to the non-discretionary variables affecting the performance of airports. It also suggests that policymakers and airport managers consider the identified factors when benchmarking airports.","The science and practice of airport performance measurement has evolved from the earliest phases of the sector's commercialisation in the 1970s through to the era of privatisation in the late 1990s and beyond. The first contribution came from Doganis and Thompson (1973) and their analysis of the economic and financial performance of the UK airport industry. This and subsequent contributions developed what became known as the partial performance measurement framework, which was built around the derivation of ratios from selected combinations of inputs and outputs (Graham, 2018). The partial performance framework is still being applied in contemporary times but much more extensively in airport management practice, where it is perceived as having a particularly useful and practical application (ACI, 2012). However, the partial performance framework is limited in its ability to provide a more aggregated measure of efficiency because metrics are derived from selected combinations of inputs and outputs. For instance, factor substitution between, for example, labour and capital cannot be detected or diagnosed under the partial performance framework.====Since the late 1990s, there has, however, been a steady and growing interest in the development of more sophisticated multi-dimensional techniques that can overcome those limitations inherent in the partial performance framework. Some examples are the average approaches such as Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and frontier approaches such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). A review of the extensive body of literature on airport performance measurement shows that 78% of contributions have used non-parametric approaches, and of these, around 80% have adopted DEA methods.====Contributions to the extensive literature on airport performance estimation using DEA will have typically estimated and compared the overall efficiency of individual airports in a given sample. In all of these instances, the efficiencies are determined by a relationship that exists between the airport's inputs and outputs and the sources of efficiency or inefficiency are all assumed to be endogenous to an airport's production system. However, there has been a minimal amount of research on the potential relationship that exists between exogenous factors and airport efficiency. Few papers have considered the effect of macro-environmental factors such as the level of economic development and location. Hooper (2002) and Chaouk et al. (2019) argue that the successes of airports, especially those that have been privatised, were to a large extent due to the effects of exogenous factors such as the presence of a well-developed, mature and stable institutional and regulatory framework coupled with a minimal level of political risk. This argument suggests that airport success in terms of performance or efficiency can be due to the effects of not only endogenous variables but those factors that are outside of managerial control that encompass sets of national macro-environmental factors; this hypothesis has yet to be thoroughly tested.====Therefore, this paper aims to fill in the gap in the literature related to whether macro-environmental factors do indeed have an influence on airport performance, and to identify the significant ones. This is done by conducting a test, using a two-stage approach involving the use of DEA and truncated regression with the Simar and Wilson bootstrapping technique on a sample of 59 airport observations in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Potentially our paper can be of value to governments, civil aviation authorities and regulators suggesting that they should consider the macro-environmental context in the airport benchmarking.====This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review on airport efficiency estimation. Section 3 describes the DEA model used to estimate the efficiency of the airports in the sample, the inputs and outputs used, and the empirical results.

We address this challenge by developing a maturity model for big data readiness for airline network planning. The development of the maturity model is grounded in literature, expert interviews and case study research involving nine airlines. Four airline business models are represented, namely full-service carriers, low-cost airlines, scheduled charter airlines and cargo airlines. The maturity model has been well received with seven change requests in the model development phase. The revised version has been evaluated as exhaustive and useful by airline network planners. The self-assessment of airlines revealed low to medium maturity for most domains. Organizational factors show the lowest average maturity, IT architecture the highest. Full-service carriers seem to be more mature than airlines with different business models.","The term “big data” has excited both business leaders and researchers in recent years. With the increasing availability of data and the technological capacity to store and process large amounts of data, the frontier for business information systems has expanded tremendously (McAfee and Brynjolfsson, 2012). Whereas attention for the big data phenomenon was initially driven by practitioners (e.g., Manyika et al., 2011), the scientific community has taken up the topic quickly and placed it high on the research agenda (Abbasi et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2012; Vlahogianni et al., 2015). The appeal of big data might be rooted in its universal applicability; it can help to shape corporate strategies, improve process efficiency and effectiveness, and boost customer relations (LaValle et al., 2011).====Big data will shake up not only many corporate functions, but also a broad range of industries. Manyika et al. (2011) identified concrete applications in healthcare, public administration, retail and manufacturing. Traditionally, the logistics and transportation industry has relied heavily on data to optimize logistic networks and supplier relations (Wang et al., 2016). The nature of logistics allows for collecting a broad variety of data, e.g. on customer relations, real-time locations, and sensor data for predictive maintenance of transportation means. Within the broader transportation industry, airlines have been at the forefront of data management (Watson et al., 2006). Airlines have invested heavily not only in collecting and processing data, but also in data analytics tools to create additional business value (Wixom et al., 2008). However, not all functions within airlines have benefited the same from these investments. Whereas pricing and revenue management (Moreno-Izquierdo et al., 2015), flight operations (Ayhan et al., 2013), route profitability analysis (Kasturi et al., 2016) and customer relationship management (Noyes, 2014) have benefited most from big data analytics investments, network planning is still based on “traditional” data sources and optimization algorithms. Nonetheless, airlines and software developers are starting to realize the huge potential of big data analytics for network planning in airlines (Bertram, 2017). The first use cases on using big data for network planning seem very promising. Chen et al. (2017) discuss the application of BDA at Lufthansa to improve schedule robustness by better predicting schedule delays based on a multitude of influence factors, including weather and gate positioning. New data sources such as mobile location data can unveil holistic movement patterns across all modes of transport and inform network adjustments to capture traffic from rail and individual transportation (Bertram, 2017).====Since using big data analytics for network planning is a very recent development in the airline industry, there is a need to support network planning and management (NPM) departments of airlines with tools and theory to leverage the full benefits of big data (Vlahogianni et al., 2015). While data vendors and system developers can contribute to build the technological infrastructure for big data analytics in network planning, the network planning function needs to design and develop a useful big data ecosystem which serves the specific needs of the respective airline (Heilig and Voβ, 2017).====Implementation of big data analytics usually requires updates of IT systems, processes, and employee skills (LaValle et al., 2011). McAfee and Brynjolfsson (2012) identify four organizational transformation areas (leadership, decision making, corporate culture and talent management) complementing the technological change. In line with these findings, unsuccessful big data transformations are usually caused by management failures (Asay, 2014).====Rooted in the Capability Maturity Model designed by Paulk et al. (1993) from Carnegie Mellon University, maturity models (MMs) have become a well-established tool in information systems (IS) research to support the management in complex and novel technology transformation processes (Neff et al., 2013). The basic principle of a MM is to describe maturity stages across different relevant domains (Röglinger et al., 2012). Usually, MMs are “multi-stage models that describe typical patterns in the development of organizational capabilities” (Comuzzi and Patel, 2016, p. 1469). For each maturity level, the MM describes corresponding stages for relevant domains. These stages should be logically connected and generalizable to identify the correct maturity level of an organization. Pöppelbuß and Röglinger (2011) distinguish three application-specific purposes of MMs: The descriptive purpose views a MM as diagnostic tool to assess the current maturity state of an organization. The prescriptive purpose implies that MMs outline the desirable state (high maturity) and specify a development path for organizations to achieve this state. The comparative purpose allows to compare different organizations (or parts of organizations) through the same assessment tool, namely the MM.====MMs have been widely used across IS research. Already in 2011, Poeppelbuß et al., 2011 identified 76 different MMs in the IS research domain, which have been applied to a variety of areas, including software engineering, e-business and knowledge management. Business process management (BPM) has been a considerable application area (Rosemann and Bruin, 2005) – usually with a narrow focus on the alignment of various business processes with information systems (Luftman, 2000).====Airline network planning is a business process which relies heavily on information systems. Traditionally, IT systems have been used to perform mathematical optimizations of the airline network (Goedeking, 2010). To leverage the new big data opportunity, both business processes and the corresponding IT systems face a significant transformation need. The objective of this paper is to develop a MM for big data analytics in airline network planning which is capable to holistically assess strategic, organizational and technological domains. Furthermore, the MM should be derived from specific and relevant requirements for airline network planning. Hence, the following research questions will be addressed.====A thorough literature review and a comparative case study are conducted to define relevant requirements, to design, and to validate the MM. By defining domain specific requirements, we contribute to the scientific body of knowledge as this business problem has not yet been addressed in academic research.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical foundation and provides background on big data and strategic network planning. Section 3 describes the research methodology of the paper. Section 4 covers the definition of requirements and the design of the MM, which is evaluated in section 5.

The model is called the SARIMA Damp Trend Grey ==== (SDTGM).

For this reason, the modification consists in using the trend and seasonality effects of ==== data to calculate a dynamic damp trend factor as time grows. The DTGM damping factor is based on the forecasted data obtained by the GM(1,1) model; otherwise, the SDTGM calculates a seasonal damping factor based on historical data using a large amount of data points for short lead-times. The SDTGM has less uncertainty than the DTGM. The simulation results show that the SDTGM captures the seasonality effect and does not allow the forecast to exponentially grow.

A disadvantage of using GM model is the fact that GM models tend to calculate high airlines route pax growth for long-lead times (Carmona-Benítez et al., 2013) and for short lead-times the prediction precision of GM model is very low (Luo et al., 2009; Wang and Pei, 2014). Otherwise, the DTGM models forecast reasonable airlines routes pax growth for long lead times using a very short amount of data points, four data points (Carmona-Benítez et al., 2013). But for short lead-times and having large amount of data points, this paper studies the DTGM model prediction accuracy, the results show that DTGM model prediction accuracy improves with a dynamical seasonal damping factor which is one of the future works proposed in Carmona-Benítez et al. (2013). A larger number of data points could allow a forecasting model to capture the market behavior over time, estimate the stochastic trend, and seasonality of time series data.====In this paper, we find two problems when the DTGM model is used to forecast time series with a larger number of data points: first, its damping factor cannot capture the dynamic behavior of time series data, and second, the DTGM model is sensitive to the forecast horizon. Therefore, we prove the DTGM model cannot capture the stochastic trend and seasonality effect even when using many data points. It is because the DTGM model damping factor is static and does not change over time. Otherwise, in this paper, we propose the SDTGM model with a damping factor that captures seasonality in a dynamic way, this is an innovative damping factor that has not been developed or used before in literature. It means a seasonality damp trend grey model, which is an intelligent system, is proposed. In the case of the DTGM model, another problem is the fact that its smoothing factor is based on the forecasted data obtained using the GM model and not on the real data, this can decrease forecast accuracy because it adds to the smoothing factor the uncertainty of the forecasted data. Otherwise, the SDTGM model is based only on the information provided by the historical data which eliminate the DTGM smoothing factor uncertainty and can increase STDGM forecast accuracy. Then, the SDTGM model improves the DTGM model with a dynamic seasonal damping factor using a large amount of data points for short lead-times to forecast more accurate airlines route pax flow growth.====The modification of the DTGM model static damping trend factor for the SDTGM model dynamic damping trend factor can be used to forecast more accurate pax flow for short lead-times when a larger number of data points is available. It can also be used to simulate more realistic data because there are many studies that have been using GM models to simulate data to develop airline route networks (Carmona-Benítez et al., 2013). Then, this paper analyses the feasibility of using a GM model with static damping factor or DTGM model and using a GM model with a dynamic damping factor or SDTGM model to forecast pax flow growth.====This paper shows that forecasting pax flow between a city's origin and a city's destination (O-D pairs) is more accurate using a dynamic damping trend factor rather than a static. Thus, the authors proposed to add a seasonal dynamic trend parameter to the GM forecasting model and create the SDTGM model. This parameter can learn the trend and seasonality components and change over time based on the real data and not on the forecasted data as the DTGM model does.====In Section 2, literature review about the use of dynamic and static Grey Models is presented. In Section 3, the seasonality dynamic damping trend factor is added to the GM model to forecast reasonable airline pax flow growth. In Section 4, the source of data used to validate the proposed forecasting method is presented (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 1993–2017). In Section 5, the results are shown for 8 extreme study cases using the DTGM and the SDTGM models. In this section, the accuracy of both models is determined by the Diebold-Mariano test (Diebold and Mariano, 1995) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) both statistical tests are explained in Appendix A. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.",SARIMA damp trend grey forecasting model for airline industry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301711,22 October 2019,2019,Research Article,428.0

For this purpose, a survey is conducted with 2030 airline customers in Korea. This study aims to provide insights into Korean traveler preference to enable airlines serving Korean customers to formulate and implement successful ==== that incorporate dynamic packaging into airline websites to expand ancillary revenues. The results confirm that Korean travelers demonstrate the need for and willingness to purchase commission-based ancillaries when purchasing tickets from airlines. On average, commission-based ancillary products are positively received by respondents. Airport transfers (e.g. rail and shuttle services), foreign currency exchange offers, and travel insurance are the most popular. Female travelers, travelers in their 20s, and frequent travelers (10 + times a year) report a significantly higher need for and willingness to purchase a set of commission-based ancillaries with flights from airline websites. Willingness to purchase third-party products from airlines is higher than in previous studies, and the preference rankings also differ. This study supports the viability of commission-based ancillary offerings from airline websites targeting Korean travelers. It shows the potential for airlines to successfully upsell and cross-sell via dynamic packaging strategies, one of the first steps toward becoming competitive travel retailers.","Until very recently, the airline industry has struggled to provide required returns to investors. A decade of crises and external pressures on the industry, including natural disasters, terror attacks, political instability, financial crises, and volatile oil prices, have hurt the industry's profitability (IATA, 2011). There are other factors that have exacerbated some of the problems the industry is facing. The capital-intensive nature of airline operations requires high operating leverage, fare competition has intensified due to the entry of low-cost airlines, and increasingly transparent online fare quotes have hurt profit margins. Despite these obstacles, positive signs appeared in 2015. For the first time, airline investors were rewarded with higher returns relative to the cost of capital. Profitability improved as airlines endeavored to (1) achieve high load factors while keeping the breakeven low, (2) raise aircraft utilization rates, and (3) focus on boosting ancillary revenues (IATA, 2016, 2017a). The airline industry recorded a $34.5 billion net profit on $754 billion in revenues in 2017, and strong profitability is forecasted to continue in the future (IATA, 2017b). Warnock-Smith et al. (2017) attributed the improved financial performance to ancillary revenues. They cited a study presented at the 2014 IATA World Passenger Symposium, which showed a positive correlation between carrier operating margins and the proportion of their overall revenue specifically earned from selling ancillaries. Indeed, ancillary revenues constitute the fastest growing revenue category (CAPA, 2014). IdeaWorks estimated 2017 ancillary revenues to be $82.2 billion, more than 10% of the overall industry's estimated total revenue (Reed, 2017). Increasing ancillaries accounted for unprecedented profits for US airlines, where the five largest US carriers generated more than half of the industry's profits (CAPA, 2018; IATA, 2017b).====Ancillary revenues usually refer to revenues generated from non-ticket sources. A broadly accepted definition of ancillaries in the airline industry is that employed by IdeaWorks, who asserts that ancillaries are “====” Airline ancillaries are categorized into 1) a la carte products and 2) third-party products. A la carte products include unbundled flight products such as onboard food and beverages, checked baggage and excess baggage fees, assigned seats and seating preferences, priority check-in and early boarding privileges, wireless internet access, and many other paid options not listed (IdeaWorks). Punitive charges such as itinerary change fees, cancellation fees, credit card processing fees, and no-show penalties are also included in the group of a la carte products (Warnock-Smith et al., 2017). Third-party products include commission-based ancillaries, including commissions received from hotels, car rentals, travel insurance offers, foreign currency exchanges, and tourism packages sold on the airline's websites. Frequent flier programs offering mileage points to program members in exchange for products or services offered through business affiliates or partnerships also fall into third-party products category. Another more recent trend in this category is the occurrence of advertising sales from placements in the aircraft (e.g. in overhead bins, seat backs, trays, or in-flight magazines) or on boarding passes (IdeaWorks 2018, Warnock-Smith et al., 2017).====A la carte ancillaries involving unbundling (i.e. the practice of charging separately for products/services that have been traditionally included in the fare price) have been a current focus for both practitioners and researchers. Airline profitability turnaround has been attributed to a paradigm shift in fare pricing that originated in low-cost carriers (LCCs) and spread to full-service carriers (FSCs). Along with commission-based ancillaries, dynamic packaging has started attracting attention due to its vast potential to restructure airline revenue models in different ways (O'Connell, 2011).====Dynamic packaging refers to conveniently booking complete travel packages that include any combination of flights, accommodation, airport transfers, or tourist experiences with one click (Finntastic Marketing, 2005). It is referred to as ==== because inventory, travel components, and pricing are dynamically determined online in real-time (O'Connell, 2011). It also allows for cheaper prices because opaque package pricing enables companies to pass on more discounts to customers. When it first drew attention in the mid-2000s, dynamic packaging was expected to change the way travel agents and travel operators did business (Genesys, 2005). However, airlines themselves quickly saw clear opportunities and benefits of using dynamic packaging. The SITA/Air Transport World (ATW) Passenger Self-service survey highlighted a dramatic increase in the percentage of passengers using airline websites to book or purchase ancillary services (Rose, 2011). In the third Annual World Low Cost Airlines Congress, participants discussed dynamic packaging as a way to increase their ancillary revenue, citing Ryanair's increased conversion rate after offering dynamic packaging (Compart, 2006). Ryanair reportedly recorded increasing ancillary revenue, primarily from hotel bookings, car hires, and travel insurance sales (Compart, 2006; O'Connell, 2011). The airline's dynamic packaging at that time constituted bolt-on hyperlinks on their website. It was less integrated compared to the current way dynamic packaging is structured; it outsourced through external links like Booking.com for the hotel reservation process, and to Hertz for car hires (O'Connell and Bouquet, 2015). British Airways launched a more integrated dynamic packaging system online in 2009. It offered simple and easy packaging for flight, hotel, car rental, and tourist experiences (from cultural sightseeing to adventures), including thousands of options at better prices (British Airway, 2009). Ryanair launched a similar holiday packaging service in 2016 in an attempt to become ‘the Amazon of air travel’ with its 119 million annual passengers (Conghaile, 2016).====Nowadays, airlines strive to become true online retailers (Rose, 2011). This has been dubbed the airline retail revolution (OpenJawTech, 2017). Airlines are incorporating complementary product offers into their websites' ticket booking process seamlessly in one transaction. This has been well-received by customers because it feels natural as a part of the planning process (Rose, 2011). The new direction and revenue models have been made possible by new online travel data technology solutions and outsourcing to vendors such as Peakwork, Distribution Travel, and OpenJawTech. According to Peakwork (2017), Air France, Austrian Airlines, Condor, Corendon Airlines, Easyjet, Edelweiss, Emirates, Eurowings, Germania, KLM, Lufthansa, SkyWork Airlines, SunExpress, Swiss, Tap Portugal, Transvania, TUIfly.com, and Veuling are directly or indirectly utilizing Peakwork's dynamic packaging system. It should be noted that airline dynamic packaging is most actively offered by European airlines. Starting in 2017, Ryanair began offering dynamic packaging in the UK, Ireland, Germany, and Spain, while Easyjet's dynamic packaging has only been available in Germany (FVW, 2017). Dynamic packaging has become so prevalent in Europe that it was even blamed for the demise of the charter airline business in short-haul markets on the continent (O'Connell and Bouquet, 2015). The US has also seen an increasing customer preference for dynamic packaging. A few airlines, including Allegiant, have managed to exploit dynamic packaging opportunities (De Wit and Zuidberg, 2012). However, US airlines have a limited ability to cross-sell (i.e. the selling of complementary products to an existing airline customer) or upsell (i.e. the marketing of higher-end complementary products to an existing airline customer) during the primary airline booking process. Packages, static or dynamic, have had better selling success in Europe because the US package market is more fragmented and less vertically integrated than the European market. Moreover, many US airlines have outsourced their holiday packaging process to third-party suppliers. This has prevented US airlines from gaining valuable insight into customer marketing data, behavior, and preferences. Still, there is no doubt that airlines can seize opportunities to implement dynamic packaging as an additional revenue generator during the current ongoing transition to online packaging (Rose, 2011). Therefore, airlines have been investing in IT systems to gather information about their customers and their preferences to increase sales through direct channels such as websites (SITA, 2013).====Despite the business potential and utility of packaging travel products and services on airline websites, many airlines serving Korean travelers have yet to actively capitalize on the idea. In particular, there is a definite lack of dynamic packaging in Korean airlines. This is partly explained in that Asian airlines were initially slow to adopt and develop the LCC business model (O'Connell and Williams, 2005), and they therefore had less time to strategically focus on ancillary revenue. Prior survey results indicated that Korean passengers were less likely to use technology for their airline and travel product purchases despite the country's advanced technology penetration (SITA, 2016). This may have been because dynamic packaging was not offered by airlines serving Korean customers including airlines in Korea. If the airlines continue to avoid jumping into the dynamic packaging game, they will soon lose their competitiveness, experience smaller operating margins, face decreasing customer loyalty, create fewer partnerships, and miss opportunities to establish channels to digest distressed inventory without negatively influencing their brand.====Based on a survey of 2030 airline customers in Korea, this paper aims to study the need of Korean international air travelers for commission-based ancillaries on airline websites via dynamic packaging, as well as their willingness to purchase such ancillaries. It then attempts to provide further information about customer preferences to airlines catering to Korean travelers to help them improve their business strategies.",An analysis of traveler need for and willingness to purchase airline dynamic packaging: A Korean case study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718304319,15 October 2019,2019,Research Article,429.0

The tankering solution was based on integer linear programming algorithm using a network modelling strategy. Two methodologies have been used to calculate mission performance according to the aircraft cost index, the first is the complete method where every flight phase (climb, cruise and descent) are optimized according to the cost index. This methodology has the disadvantage of being a slow process as the optimization of every flight leg is time consuming. The second approach is a simplified method, which is based on the Breguet equation and has the advantage of being a quick solution for an initial tankering assessment analysis. A comparison is made between these two methodologies on a simulated multi-stage flight mission demonstrating the validity of this simplified approach. The benefits of a tankering flight using cost index and refuelling stops are illustrated by a study case of a network linking six airports and seventeen optional refuelling stops with different fuel costs. The results from the optimized flight route show a 3% cost reduction at the specific multi stage mission example when compared to a more traditional dispatch approach without the use of the fuel tankering strategy.","Fuel tankering has been studied and applied by airlines at least since the oil crisis in the 1970 decade (Wayne Darnell). It has become an excellent fuel saving strategy for airliners proving costs reductions up to 10% (Fregnani, 2007; Khaled AbdelghanyAhmed, 2005).====Fuel expenses remain one of the major components of an airline operational cost, depending on the aircraft size, it may approach from 20% up to 70% of its total flight cost (of Aviation Policy, 2015).====Since fuel prices are reaching record high values (of Aviation Policy, 2015), the tankering operation remains an important option for an airline cost reduction objective and is also migrating as a fuel reduction strategy to other transportation means such as locomotives (Prem Kumar, 2015) and trucks (Yoshinori Suzuki, 2014).====More recently, not only in civil operations but also the military commands and government authorities are aware of the benefit of operational costs reduction policies applied by many airliners around the world, the US Air Force has the objective of reducing aircraft fuel consumption by 20% in a 10 years period (Air Force Energy Stra, 2013). Recent work has shown a potential reduction of 110 million dollars on wartime scenario and 25 million dollars on peacetime annually at the US Air Mobility Command, tankering fuel at C-5, C-17 and C-130 mission flights (Lesinski, 2011; Tanguy Hubert et al., 2015).====Military flights have a peculiar characteristic that differs from most of commercial airlines, the availability of different intermediate refuelling stops options between the departure and arrival airports. This special characteristic makes the tankering optimization a feasible solution for military cargo operations.====Outside the military scenario, the tankering flight with additional refuelling sites may be applied in long range civil private flights, freight transport and ferry flights. For airliners, the concept may be used to aid on the definition of profitable routes, hub sites and connections.====This special characteristic is addressed in this work by an algorithm based on the travelling salesman problem to calculate the fuel tankering solution. It has been demonstrated that if the aircraft flies at the mission cost index, the optimal tankering solution is not equivalent to the minimum-fuel-used option.====This work shows that the tankering flight concept combined with the cost index flying has the potential of saving total airline operational costs and not only the fuel used. In a flight mission example, a reduction of ==== was achieved at an airline with a time dependant costs of ====. Also, this work contributes to expanding the tankering flight allowing for optional intermediate refuelling stops between the flight network. These optional stops may be used between the departure and arrival airport if total operational costs are reduced. This concept may be more useful for military flight where a larger flexibility exists among routes between different airbases. Finally a simplified method based on the Breguet Range Equation is proposed for fast tankering trade-off analysis and performance estimation that may eliminate the necessity for complex computational tools facilitating the analysis in an operational environment.",The benefits of tankering considering cost index flying and optional refuelling stops,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718302692,14 October 2019,2019,Research Article,430.0

Sweden is used as a case study. The results show that even if most of the Swedish population already has a good accessibility, the model can suggest new routes that can further improve accessibility without increasing the subsidisation cost. The closure of an airport reduces the available commercial routes, which would impair the accessibility to a given destination; a subsidised route would hence be required as a replacement. The ability of the model to consider several accessibility criteria makes it useful for managers at transportation authorities when making airport location decisions.","The deregulation of air transportation (1978 and 1987 in the United States and Europe, respectively) gave airlines the liberty to choose new profitable routes to operate and consequently to abandon the unprofitable ones. Therefore, routes with insufficient passenger demand, although crucial in regional economic development, are often ignored by airlines (Morrison and Winston, 2010; Williams and Bråthen, 2012). In reaction, countries adopted subsidy schemes to guarantee accessibility to and from small communities or regions with insufficient demand for commercial air services. Examples of subsidy schemes include the Public Service Obligation (PSO) provided by countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), and the Essential Air Service (EAS) program in the United States. Subsidy schemes provide scheduled air services in communities where commercial air services are considered unprofitable by airlines. Additionally, they aim to link a target community to a potential destination such as a hub airport or a major city. However, the subsidy schemes are characterised by critics for underutilisation of the routes and disproportional cost of subsidisation.====The subsidy schemes aim to achieve an efficient air transportation network and this involves making decisions about which routes to subsidise, with respect to defined criteria and the available budget. Defining a criterion avoids ad-hoc decision-making by the authorities, eliminates wasteful resource allocation through inefficient transportation networks and is used as a foundation for efficient transportation service provision (Bråthen and Eriksen, 2018).",Decision Support for an Optimal Choice of Subsidised Routes in Air Transportation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719302467,9 October 2019,2019,Research Article,431.0

First, for four different types of criteria—min-max, min-sum, completion time related, and due-dates related criteria—their corresponding physical meanings in ALP are elaborated. Then, a criteria selection method is proposed to determine several appropriate criteria, which are taken as the multi-objective while modeling ALP. Different solution algorithms, including Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), are adopted to solve the multi-objective ALP. Finally, the performance of the proposed model and method are evaluated using a set of benchmark instances. The computational results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach for solving ALP, which can simultaneously improve punctual performance, enhance runway utilization, reduce air traffic controller workload, and maintain equity among airlines.","The rapid growth of air traffic has led to aviation congestion problems, resulting in substantial flight delays, excessive fuel consumption, and consequential air pollutant emissions. Airports are usually the bottlenecks of the national airspace system (Zografos et al., 2017). Enhancing the utilization of runway capacity at an airport via air traffic management can improve its operational efficiency and alleviate aviation congestion. One ATM challenge is to schedule arrival aircraft efficiently, referred to as the Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) (Bennell et al., 2013). Although ALP has been studied extensively, we propose to address it from a more holistic perspective.====To solve ALP, the sequence and time of aircraft landing on available runways should be determined by optimizing given objectives while subject to a variety of operational constraints. For environments, some studies were carried out in a static context (Bennell et al., 2013; Beasley et al., 2000) and others focused on a dynamic context (Hu and Chen, 2005; Bennell et al., 2017). Regarding solution algorithms, several methods have been used to solve ALP. CPLEX was used to solve small-scale ALP formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem (Vadlamani and Hosseini, 2014). For large-scale ALP, dynamic programming (DP) (Balakrishnan and Chandran, 2010; Lieder et al., 2015) and branch and bound (BB) (Solving and Clarke, 2014) have been implemented. In addition, some studies used heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms such as cellular automata optimization (CAO) (Yu et al., 2011), simulated annealing (SA) algorithm (Salehipour et al., 2013), particle swarm optimization (PSO) (Girish, 2016), genetic algorithm (GA) (Hu and Di Paolo, 2008; Hu and Di Paolo, 2009), and ant colony (AC) algorithm (Zhan et al., 2010; Xu, 2017).====In addition to environments and algorithms, the objectives that appeared in previous studies were not the same, including the following: (1) Minimizing the total cost (Beasley et al., 2000; Vadlamani and Hosseini, 2014; Lieder et al., 2015) (Yu et al., 2011; Salehipour et al., 2013; Girish, 2016) (Faye, 2015; Sabar and Kenall, 2015; Ji et al., 2016), i.e., the total weighted earliness plus the total weighted tardiness, in which the earliness or tardiness was the deviation of actual landing time from the target one; in addition, the cost could be a linear, piecewise linear, or non-linear function; (2) Minimizing the total or average delay (Hu and Chen, 2005) (Hu and Di Paolo, 2008; Hu and Di Paolo, 2009; Zhan et al., 2010) (Eun et al., 2010) of arrival aircraft; this criterion emphasizes on the operating cost of airlines; (3) Minimizing the scheduled time of the last aircraft (Harikiopoulo and Neogi, 2011; Ji et al., 2017) (or maximizing runway throughput); and (4) Leveling the workload of ground staff (Boysen and Fliedner, 2011; Mokhtarimousavi et al., 2015). Some previous studies also considered two or more objectives simultaneously. Lee and Balakrishnan (Balakrishnan and Chandran, 2010) introduced a general landing cost function to encompass runway throughput maximization and average delay minimization. Tang et al. (2008) considered minimizing the total scheduled time and total cost simultaneously. Mokhtarimousavi et al. (2015) gave a new mathematical formulation of ALP that included three criteria—maximizing runway throughput, minimizing ground costs (apron and parking), and minimizing air costs (fuel consumption and carbon dioxide pollution). Hong et al. (2017) proposed a multi-objective optimization approach for ALP to minimize total flight time and the number of the sequence change. Samà et al. (2017) investigated the MILP formulations of ALP with different objective functions and examined the differences between the solutions regarding various performance indicators.====The objectives of ALP in previous studies reflect the explicit or implicit concerns of different stakeholders, such as Air Traffic Control (ATC), airlines, airports, and government. ATC aims to ensure the safety and efficiency of the national airspace system. Airlines are concerned about operating costs and on-time performance. Airports care about passenger throughput, which is the primary source of their revenue, and also hope to reduce airfield congestion. Government preference is to have air transportation help stimulate vital economic development and mitigate environmental impacts (noise and air pollution) on the local community. In summary, ALP reflects the interests of different stakeholders, and their interests may conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the selection of objective functions in previous studies is relatively straightforward without a precise mechanism.====The primary purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical background on how to choose the appropriate objective functions in multi-objective optimization for ALP. For this purpose, given that ALP is similar to the machine scheduling problem, we learn from the selection of different criteria, equivalent to objective functions, in the machine scheduling problem (Vadlamani and Hosseini, 2014; Hancerliogullari et al., 2013) by revealing the inherent link of criteria between ALP and machine scheduling and determining appropriate criteria for ALP based on existence theorems and lower bounds for scheduling to meet bi-criteria (Stein and Wein, 1997; Aslam et al., 1999; Rasala et al., 2002; Eren and Güner, 2006; Lin and Lin, 2015; Huo and Zhao, 2015; Wu et al., 2018). As elaborated later, the three criteria determined finally by learning from the machine learning problem are 1) total flight delay time, 2) total dwell time in the terminal area, and 3) maximum dwell time. It should be noted that ALP with a single runway is the focus of this study, as the Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) intends to allocate the landing runway for the aircraft based on its entry fix such that the runway allocation principle could alleviate potential conflicts in air. On the contrary, airports and airlines prefer to allocate the landing runway for aircraft based on gates. Such a principle can not only alleviate potential conflicts on the ground but also reduce taxiing time. Correspondingly, if we consider runway allocation, the model and algorithm for the multi-objective optimization of ALP will be more complicated. We will address this issue in a future study.====We propose a multi-objective optimization method to solve ALP with multiple criteria. Hoogeveen (2005) identified two methodologies—lexicographical and simultaneous optimization—and also summarized three approaches for simultaneous optimization— aggregating different criteria into one composite objective function, converting criteria into constraints, and determining Pareto optimal. In this study, we combined two approaches in simultaneous optimization—==== and ====—and propose a multi-objective ALP. The trade-off between the objectives, as well as the model performance of different single objectives, is discussed to obtain insights on air traffic management of arrival flights. Since the multi-objective ALP is time-consuming, an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm, Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) (Hosseinia and Khaled, 2014; Khaled and Hosseinia, 2015), is implemented to solve the ALP.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

However, because 21 out of 45 airline companies are found to be efficient based on this analysis, a stepwise regression-based mechanism is applied to four reduced models – one for each output variable – for better discrimination. The outputs are, namely, net profit margin (financial output), passengers carried, on-time departure performance (operational outputs), and customer satisfaction (marketing output). In this way, the significant input variables are found for each reduced model. In the third stage, in order to provide even more discrimination, social network-based eigenvector centrality values are used as the weights of the superefficiency scores, and the strengths and weaknesses of efficient airlines for each output are specified in terms of their related significant inputs. The results show that, when net profit margin is taken as an output, Vietnam Airlines has the top weighted superefficiency value and excels in terms of available seat kilometers and liquidity, but it should improve its debt level. Although Norwegian Airlines has the highest efficiency with respect to debt level, it is not the best role model because its eigenvector centrality value is relatively low. However, Norwegian airlines also has the highest weighted superefficiency and acts as a role model in terms of on-time departures with respect to this output. Its main strength is liquidity, and it has no significant weaknesses. On the other hand, in terms of overall satisfaction and passengers carried, Vietnam Airlines and Thai Airways are the leaders, respectively. Vietnam Airlines is the only superefficient company with respect to overall satisfaction, while the basic strengths of Thai Airways in terms of passengers carried are its employee and fleet, and it has no significant weakness. A final aggregation of the results is made by making pairwise comparisons of the relative importance of four outputs for 7 experts selected from different departments of airline companies. According to the results, Net Profit Margin has the highest priority, followed by On-time Departure and Overall Customer Satisfaction, while passengers carried has the lowest importance. Based on these relative priorities, it can be said that Vietnam Airlines can be accepted as the top performing airline company, followed by Norwegian Airlines.","Today, airline companies are facing important financial, operational and customer service performance fluctuations. To improve the competitiveness of airline companies, it is necessary to use appropriate tools to measure their efficiencies in these dimensions. However, the efficiency evaluation is difficult because of the large number of complex factors involved. For example, a focus on service quality may help to increase customer satisfaction and, hence, improve service productivity, but the operational and financial performance may be subsequently reduced as a result. Contrarily, decisions to improve an airline's operational and financial performance regardless of customer satisfaction may result in internal and external factors that can cause a number of negative reactions. As seen, the problem has a multidimensional aspect. On the other hand, the results are also heavily influenced by the variables that are taken into account (Colli et al., 2011).====This study proposes an integrated superefficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model with a stepwise regression-based feedback mechanism and social network analysis to evaluate the performance of the world's 45 major airline companies. The superefficiency DEA results are weighted with eigenvector centrality values to discriminate among the efficient airline companies. Based on the network-based analysis proposed by Liu and Lu (2010), the strengths and weaknesses of each efficient airline company are analyzed in detail for each considered output. For this purpose, a directed and weighted graph is constructed, in which the nodes represent the airline companies and the edges represent their relationships. This method can rank efficient DMUs, taking into account their qualities by utilizing the eigenvector centrality concept. This analysis aims develop a road map to specify the basic improvement areas in which each airline company should focus and make investments. The basic contributions of the study can be summarized as follows:====The next section provides the literature survey on airline efficiency measurement and the variable selection methods. The third section provides the proposed methodology and its application to the worldwide known 45 airline companies, which also underlines the managerial implications for each output based on the superefficiency DEA.

Yet it is evident that people travel for reasons that may include forced and voluntary movement, with motives ranging from visiting friends and family, to leisure, or business. In light of the challenge to decarbonise transport, and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this paper discusses the perceived necessity of flight from individual and societal perspectives, while considering moral and economic viewpoints. It suggests that travel motives have different degrees of ‘urgency’, and that the ‘necessity of flight’ cannot be generalised. To empirically test this hypothesis in an exploratory survey, we used mixed methods to examine the perspectives of 29 international students at Lund University, Sweden on the perceived importance of their flights (n = 587) over a six-year period (2012–2017). Results show that the value associated with individual flights depends on flight motive, experience, life stage, or situational factors. Notably, almost half of the leisure flights made lack importance. Implications are discussed in the context of climate policy and the future development of the aviation system.","Aviation is increasingly in conflict with societal goals to limit climate change and challenges related to air pollution, noise, and infrastructure expansion (Finance and Trade Watch, 2016; Gössling and Upham, 2009). While aviation advocates have frequently underlined the importance of air traffic for GDP growth and employment, it is equally clear that increasing dependence on air travel contradicts several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015), such as Responsible Production and Consumption (Goal 12) and Climate Action (Goal 13), and undermines the Paris Agreement (Scott et al., 2016). These problems have become ever more pressing under scenarios of continued growth of air travel, as anticipated by industry actor groups. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organisation projects that emissions will grow by a factor of 2.8–3.9 between 2010 and 2040 (ICAO, 2016). Neither technology innovations, the aviation sector's own strategies, nor market-based measures can be expected to resolve this situation (Lyle, 2018; Markham et al., 2018; Peeters et al., 2016). A central question for aviation is thus whether people should, or could, fly less. This pressing question received global attention when it was raised by the Fridays for Future movement and the mainstream media's reporting on ‘flight shame’ in early 2019 (e.g. Evening Standard, 2019). The Guardian (2019, no page) summarised the dilemma:====It is generally established that people travel for a wide range of reasons, such as business, to visit friends and family, to relax or escape, to experience novelty, or self-develop (Pearce and Lee, 2005). Most of the longer distance trips involve aircraft, and an estimated 57 percent of all international arrivals are now by air (UNWTO, 2018). Against this background, aviation organisations maintain two main discourses. The first sustains the notion that air travel is a ‘norm’, involving large parts of the global population. While this is communicated by highlighting large global passenger numbers (e.g. IATA, 2018), it obscures the reality that most flights are taken by the most privileged social classes in the most affluent societies. The second discourse affirms that all air travel is valid, in the sense that flying is socially desirable and morally warranted, and that individual motivations for air travel are rational and justifiable, with air travel providing economic value (IATA, 2018; UNWTO, 2018). This latter discourse is perhaps best understood in terms of the absence of any critical debate on air travel motivations among supranational organisations such as United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), World Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC), International Air Transport Association (IATA), or International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).====The low carbon challenge underlying the Paris Agreement demands a critical discussion of the discourses surrounding air travel. This article seeks to examine the ‘necessity of flight’, that is, the question of whether all air travel is perceived to be of equal importance, in order to ascertain the types of flight that might be more easily reduced. For this purpose, motivations for air travel are discussed from moral and economic perspectives. Moral concern demands reconsideration of energy-intense activities and lifestyles against the background of carbon inequality and the Sustainable Development Goals (Oxfam, 2015; UN, 2015). Economic perspectives are characterised by utility values assigned to air travel; that is, the money people are willing to spend in order to fly. Both moral concern and economic value can be discussed from societal and individual perspectives. The paper conceptualises these interrelationships to then present the results of a mixed methods empirical study, in which personal value associations with air travel are analysed out of personal, retrospective views on the importance of flight.",Can we fly less?

These small mountain airports can offer the airlines unparalleled accessibility to the resorts, but their ==== are typically not well populated. Local authorities are keen to develop scheduled flights but have failed many times in the past. In this context, there is no previous study that analyses the drivers of scheduled airport traffic in winter tourism regions. To that end, we compiled a large dataset of European airports and ski resorts and carry out a ====. Results show that catchment area, competition, and infrastructure outweigh accessibility to ski resorts as the main drivers of scheduled traffic at small mountain airports. This is linked to the ==== of low-cost carriers that prefer to operate out of major airports with larger aircraft. Small airports are recommended to focus on premium markets with smaller aircraft.","Ski resorts in Europe are major tourism destinations that can generate traffic for the airports in their vicinity, as well as a substantial economic impact to the surrounding communities (Lasanta et al., 2007). Ski resorts are typically located in remote, mountain areas, and several authors have noted the importance of accessibility as a driver of service quality for ski tourists (Konu et al., 2011; Zemła, 2008). Indeed, access cost (linked to travel distance) represents a substantial part of the cost of a skiing trip, particularly for international visitors (Godfrey, 1999; Miragaia and Martins, 2015). Hence, the resorts can benefit from airline connectivity to their origin markets (Perboli et al., 2015), complemented with good local transport services by road or rail to transfer between the airport and the resort (Flagestad and Hope, 2001). Regarding how accessibility can affect visitor choice, two opposite arguments can be made. On one hand, winter tourism markets in Europe are still dominated by charter airlines, where bundling of travel services (flight, transfer, accommodation, forfeit) is common (Perboli et al., 2015). Hence, passengers may not be sensitive to the cost of transfer services if it is included in the full price of the package. On the other hand, the strong penetration of low-cost carriers in European tourism markets during the last decades (Dobruszkes, 2013), and the consequent unbundling of travel services raises the question of whether winter tourists, and the airlines that serve this segment of demand, value the proximity to a ski resort when deciding to fly to a given airport.====This is a question of great importance for the airports located in areas with a high density of ski resorts. These airports, typically of small size and located in mountain regions, can offer the airlines unparalleled accessibility to the resorts in terms of proximity and transfer times. Trying to leverage on that competitive advantage, a common aspiration of local authorities and airport managers is to develop scheduled traffic, and, during the last decade, many failed attempts have been recorded. We can mention Bolzano, Aosta, or Annecy airports, that, despite their prime geographical location to support winter tourism, have either failed to sustain public service obligation (PSO) routes, or to justify the subsidy given to an air carrier for regular flights given the lack of traffic. There is consensus in the airport business performance literature about the challenges of sustaining a profitable operation in small airports due to economies of scale, which lead to high average operating costs at low traffic levels (See e.g. Martín et al., 2011). There is also an element of strong traffic seasonality if the airports serve highly touristic regions dominated by charter traffic, which creates challenges to plan and manage human resources (Halpern, 2008, 2011) and can decrease operational efficiency (Fernández et al., 2018). All these points justify the interest of airport managers to attract and sustain scheduled flights.====In this context, we note that there is no previous study that analyses the drivers of scheduled airport traffic in winter tourism regions. Thus, we aim to shed light on the question of whether small mountain airports can be successful in sustaining scheduled traffic based on their convenient accessibility to ski resorts or they need to complement that characteristic with other desirable features to deliver a more attractive option to airlines. The chosen variables are given by the literature on airport business performance, which highlights the role of airport size, local population, and competition.====In order to achieve our research objectives, we compile a comprehensive dataset of commercial airports (with and without scheduled traffic) and ski resorts in Europe and employ a Geographical Information System (ArcGIS) to identify the relevant airport sample and obtain the accessibility measures. Given the scarcity of publications on small winter airports, we perform an exploratory analysis of our data to provide initial insights on the importance of the chosen variables to generate airport traffic and design our econometric approach. We then employ a zero-inflated Poisson regression, in which the indicators of infrastructure and competition are set as drivers of the propensity of the airports to capture zero scheduled traffic. This is a key differentiating aspect with respect to past papers, as we include airports without traffic in the analysis==== and discuss, based on the estimated coefficients of the Poisson model, which ones have the highest potential to develop regular flights. The results from our analysis contribute to the literature on the sustainability of small tourist airports, which is almost exclusively geared towards analysing the effects of summer seasonality in coastal areas. In relation to the broader literature on tourism seasonality, we find the use of air traffic data to be common in this subject (e.g. Rosselló and Sansó, 2017) and indeed the presence of strong winter seasonality has been documented for areas with high density of ski resorts (Ferrante et al., 2018). However, these studies employ country-level data that cannot be translated to the airport-specific approach we employ here.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the literature on airport business performance that supports our choice of variables. Section 3 presents the small winter airports dataset and performs an exploratory data analysis to obtain insights of methodological relevance. In addition, the Poisson regression model is explained in detail. Section 4 presents the results and discusses their main implications. Section 5 concludes with a summary of the main findings.","Drivers of airport scheduled traffic in European winter tourism areas: Infrastructure, accessibility, competition and catchment area",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301449,26 September 2019,2019,Research Article,443.0

Therefore, changes are required in airport planning, either in its master plan or operational improvement. In this context, we highlight airport technology, which increasingly contrbutes for changes in the airport system. Besides, airport technology is being introduced at airports to provide passengers with faster, safer and more efficient processing in order to contribute to a better airport performance. However, existing knowledge on innovation to enhance passengers experience is limited. This study contributes to fill this gap by analyzing the possibility of airport passengers to use biometric technology. Different types of airport technology, which are being developed to offer passengers a faster, smother, safer and more efficient process, are in the spotlight. This paper discusses the likelihood to use biometric technology in check-in procedures, technology non-existent in Brazilian airports, through discrete choice model, specifically the binomial logit. Using a database of 760 passengers interviewed at three different Brazilian airports, the results showed that 82.94% of passengers would use this new technology.","Airport technology has been developed and implemented in airports in order to offer passengers a faster, more secure and efficient experience, making traveling less stressful (Kalakou et al., 2015). This technology provides benefits to airport operators and their users (Abdelaziz et al., 2010), such as time optimization which decreases queues reducing waiting time, as well as operating costs (Bogicevic, 2017).====Within this context, it is believed that introducing such technology in airports may increase the capacity of the airport terminals (Ashford et al., 2013). Additionally, it contributes to time optimization (Bogicevic, 2017), which allows to better orient passengers’ consumption habits, improving airport non-aeronautical revenue. For airlines and airport, the technologies could offer a quick and secure identification to improving customer satisfaction.====However, due to the fast technological advances at airports, it is advisable that the operator conduct studies prior to the implementation of such technology, in order to check whether passengers are prone to use it or not, because once it is introduced, it may result in passengers’ dissatisfaction if it is not well accepted.====Among previous airport technology studies (Bogicevic, 2017; Kalakou et al., 2015; Abdelaziz et al., 2010) and discrete choice models, involving airports (Ashford and Bencheman, 1987; Hess and Polak, 2005; Hess et al., 2007; Loo, 2008; Marcucci and Gatta, 2011; Paliska et al., 2016 and Muñoz et al., 2017), none of them conducts an analysis of the probability of passengers to use a nonexistent technology in an airport terminal.====Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine through the discrete choice model, the probability of passengers to use this technology underdevelopment, more specifically, biometric technology in the check-in procedure. The analyses of this airport technology, which is underdevelopment, may not only collaborate with academic knowledge, but may also be significant to airport operators.",Acceptance of biometric technology in airport check-in,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719300730,6 September 2019,2019,Research Article,444.0

The finding of study facilitates the insights for improvement of various dimensions and constructs for an effective human performance management for ATC in Thailand. The study fulfills the theoretical gap by employing the Fuzzy ==== (MCDM) method of identifying and measuring human performance in ATC.,"The aviation industry is characterized by a complex structure and dynamic advancement of technology which inherently put forth a challenge to work performance of human pertaining to the ever changing environment, concurrent task demand, time pressure and tactical constraint (Sheridan, 2002). In most of the air accidents, it is observed that slack in human performance plays a vital role (Hawkins, 1993; Chang and Yeh, 2004). As ‘Swiss Cheese’ model indicates that most of the air accidents are multi-causal in nature, therefore the residual threats for the accidents often result from the interaction of multiple human factors and resulting in the cumulative impact on performance (Edwards et al., 2012). This necessitates the need to identify the multi-factorial model of human performance to build up a safe and reliable aviation system. It is observed that the multi-factorial model of human performance in aviation has been a under-researched topic with special reference to the Air Traffic Control (ATC). There has been a plethora of research in the field of ATC pertaining to the role of human error in the occurrence of accidents, stress and fatigue and aviation safety, but very few studies have been conducted to explore the factors governing the job performance in ATC.====As ATC is a critical assignment pertaining to aviation safety, this requires highly skilled operatives to collaborate in a large and complex human-machine system (Bentley et al., 1995). The ATC officers play the central role, interacting cooperatively with all components of the ATC system, resulting in the safe and efficient flow of air traffic. Hence, the understanding of the factors governing the performance of an ATC officer would enable a safe, efficient and reliable ATC system. The quest to mitigate the human error management in ATC lies on the fact that how soundly the factors governing the human performance are identified and addressed. As the ATC system is highly dynamic faced with continuously technological enhancement; it is desirable to explore the current factors that affect human performance at work. In this context, there is an immense need of conceptual contribution to the literature on the current topic with the objective to explore and identify the critical human performance factors pertaining to the ATC system.

We studied 61 articles and notes published during 2009–2017 that assess the performance of airports across the globe using ontology-based text analysis. Each article aims at achieving objectives beyond the mere calculation of efficiency scores of airports. On the basis of these objectives, four themes emerge – explaining the variation of efficiency through exogenous factors; mapping the change in efficiency over time; decomposition of efficiency using network DEA; and comparing DEA with other tools. We find that there is no systematic approach for selection of inputs and outputs, as they are largely dependent on the availability of data. Most studies computing scale efficiency report that airports exhibit returns to scale. Ownership form of airports is the most commonly studied factor for explaining the variation in efficiency; however, there is no consensus in the findings. Nearly one-third articles study the change in efficiency over time reporting similar findings that can be generalized. The research gap emerging from the review is that there is insufficient thrust on the application of efficiency scores obtained from DEA for improving airport performance. The main contribution of the paper is an analysis of the approaches used for performance measurement and the associations made with the efficiency scores.","Measuring the performance of any industry is important from the point of view of cost control. For airports, however, there are many more considerations. Airports are one of the gateways to a country and they have high economic and strategic importance. With the advent of Open Skies Agreement, all major airports are aiming to become international hubs of airlines, and with new airports being proposed in many metropolitan cities globally, they are subjected to unprecedented competitive pressures. Further, with increasing affordability of air travel, small and regional airports are also gaining importance at the country level.

According to the EUROCONTROL report (EUROCONTROL, 2018), “EUROCONTROL Seven-Year Forecast”, in 2017, a 4% annual growth has been recorded for the IFR (instrument flight rules) flights movements, reaching a total number of 10.6 million flights.==== For 2018–2024 EUROCONTROL forecasts an average of 2.3% annual growth in IFR movements in Europe, leading to about 12 million European flights in 2024 (EUROCONTROL, 2018).====A series of European airports, such as Munich, Pisa, London, Luton, Frankfurt, Amsterdam Schipol, Henry Coanda Bucharest Otopeni, Salzburg, Stuttgart, Kharkiv, Madrid, and others, are using apron buses for travelers’ transport to the aircraft before boarding and after landing, especially for flights having 150–200 passengers (Delcea et al., 2018a). In addition to that, Airside International acknowledges the importance of the apron buses stating that “for the large number of airports around the world that move passengers through remote stands, buses are the preferred method” (Airside International, 2018), knowing that the capacity of an airport is related to the number of its flight-routes.====Some airlines have adapted their boarding pass to help each passenger select the appropriate door, i.e., front or rear door, to board an aircraft after getting off the apron bus by placing a small image containing the suggested aircraft door to use according to his/her seat on the boarding pass as illustrated in Fig. 1.====While the use of apron buses has been increasing, research on boarding methods with apron buses has lagged behind. Time remains one of the most valuable resources for both passengers and airlines, and a faster boarding process benefits both passengers and airlines. Considering the literature, a reduction of the overall boarding time can be made by selecting the proper boarding method, and a series of papers have proposed different methods based on random, by group, and by seat rules. It can be straightforward to implement these methods when the boarding process is made using a jet-bridge because the passengers’ admission into the airplane can be made in as many groups as needed. On the contrary, when apron buses are used for boarding, in most of the cases, two buses are used, which limits the number of boarding groups to only two—one group of passengers for each bus. As with the other by group methods, with apron buses, the airline does not control the sequence in which passengers of a given group (i.e. from a given bus) board the airplane. For example, passengers depart from an apron bus in any sequence they wish and proceed directly to their airplane door—without being organized or guided in a particular sequence by the airline. Once aboard the airplane, passengers proceed to their seats. (The Supplementary Materials section of this paper, immediately prior to the References section, describes how to access videos that illustrate the flow of passengers from the airplane doors to their seats: first one group of passengers from the first apron bus boards, followed by a second group of passengers from the second apron bus).====When apron buses are used, the usual practice is to randomly assign passengers to each apron bus. In a recent study, Delcea et al. (2018a) examine the Back-to-front approach while considering boarding a plane from the front and rear doors. They show that a reduction of 8.9% in boarding time is attainable when using the Back-to-front method instead of the classical random boarding method with assigned seats.====Considering the methods proposed in the literature when jet bridges are used, we observe that although the Back-to-front method improves the boarding time compared to the random boarding with assigned seats, it doesn't provide the most reduction in boarding time compared to other methods (Ferrari and Nagel, 2005; Kierzkowski and Kisiel, 2017; Milne and Kelly, 2014; Qiang et al., 2017, 2014; Steffen, 2008a; Steffen and Hotchkiss, 2012). Therefore, in this study, we investigate the performance of new boarding methods we created to use when two apron buses transport passengers who board an airplane through its front and rear doors simultaneously. Our new boarding methods are inspired by existing boarding methods that improve boarding time when only one of the plane's door is used for passenger boarding. We employ an agent-based modeling approach to simulate boarding process and the passengers' movement during the boarding of a plane. We conduct our experiments in an Airbus 320 configuration also studied in (Schultz, 2018a, 2018b). This plane configuration consists of 30 seat rows, one aisle and three seats on each side of the aisle (See Fig. 2). We aim to determine if any of the proposed boarding methods when employing apron buses can reduce the boarding time compared to the Back-to-front approach studied in (Delcea et al., 2018a).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the second section introduces some of the latest research in airplane boarding methods considering the research focusing on one-door and two-door boarding methods. Section 3 describes the new boarding methods, while Section 4 explains the passenger movements and luggage assumptions. The rules governing the agent-based simulation model in NetLogo are presented in Section 5. Section 6 provides the numerical results of conducting the simulations experiments.

Indeed, it is the highest contributor to aviation accidents, where stress is correlated positively. Despite the large research base for commercial or military pilots, there is no study related to the workplace stressors of ab-initio pilots. With these considerations in mind, the present study is set out to explore stress factors among ab-initio pilots in the university. For this purpose, stressors were isolated and assessed by interviews with flight instructors. Then, the ==== (AHP) is applied to weigh those stressors among ab-initio pilots. A hierarchy was built with 3 criteria and 12 sub-criteria. Results showed that the most important criterion in stress among ab-initio pilots is personal factors, followed by organizational factors and environmental factors. Furthermore, the results revealed that the first four stressors within the global ranking were determined as the lack in body of knowledge, meteorological conditions, personality, and facilities and the fleet with the weights of 0.195, 0.154, 0.11 and 0.109. This work is unique due to its coverage of ab-initio pilots, and the results presented here may facilitate improvements in the evaluation of individual ab-initio pilots and the teaching environment for stress contributing factors.","The majority of air transport-related accidents are based on human factors (Kharoufah et al., 2018; Shappell et al., 2017). E.g., 68% of accidents between 1999 and 2008 involved decision error (Li, 2011), and up to 80% of accidents are based on human errors (Wiegmann and Shappell, 2001). While major airline crashes do have less interaction with pilot error, this number is more than doubled in general aviation (Li, 2011), where ab-initio (student) pilots are educated. Considering that the general aviation pilot is with 90.6% the cause of fatal accidents (Endsley and Garland, 2000), the ab-initio pilot is extremely endangered with his limited situational awareness. Furthermore, it has been reported that ab-initio pilots have adverse mental state i.e., stress, and thus, they are prone to make failure with 29% of the flight training accidents (Kilic, 2019). Then, compared to ordinary life, the stress levels are also rising in universities (Robotham and Julian, 2006). Thus, it is especially important to investigate young ab-initio pilots in universities.====Inadequate situational awareness is the most common causation in aviation accidents (Kharoufah et al., 2018), and awareness gets easily distracted by stressors. This affects flight safety by “either increasing performance demand or reducing pilot performance ability” (Li, 2011). Piloting is simply stressful (Henley, 1987; Langton and Robbins, 2006) and requires naturalistic decision making under stress, where for there are many differences among expert- and ab-initio pilots (Deitch, 2001). Ab-initio pilots are further endangered due to the lack of experience and insufficient internalization of the body of knowledge (Kilic and Soran, 2019). Consequently, ab-initio pilots react to the stressors of flight much more than their experienced instructors (Farrace et al., 1996). To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has examined the stressors of ab-initio pilots in civil aviation. Only a few studies have focused on related individual topics such as the effects of stress on flight (Hawkins, 1993; Lee, 2010), on pilot performance with respect to personality and life (Stokes and Kite, 2017), on pilot training (Davey, 2004), the effect of inadequate flight instruction on stress (Henley, 1987; Krahenbuhl et al., 1981), stress coping methods (Leo and Chandramohan, 2008), success factors for pilot training (Boyd, 2003), crew resource management and effects of culture (Helmreich and Merritt, 2016), and it mainly focuses on commercial or military pilots.====In consideration of this, the main goal of this work is to study the stressors among ab-initio pilots by implementing an AHP method. Consequently, the research questions were crystallized as====This paper is organized as follows. In the second, section a literature review for the stressors of ab-initio pilots is presented, and a hierarchical model for the aggregation is proposed. In the third section, analytic hierarchical process (AHP) is applied to define the weights of the contributing factors, yielding in a structured model. In the next section, the results are discussed.

We present the impact using a panel dataset of 22 city pairs. We found that HSR competition makes the airlines' intertemporal price curve steeper, meaning that the price strategy for leisure and business travelers has changed. Additionally, the increase in leisure demand increases airlines' average price (especially along HSR competition routes), while the airlines' average price is relatively low on the routes with high business demand. Notably, with HSR competition, a different ==== strategy is presented, wherein airlines’ average price is higher on the routes with higher business demand.","In China's high-speed passenger transportation system, the status of high-speed rail (HSR) has become increasingly important. Since2008,==== China's HSR has developed rapidly, and in 2017, the mileage of new HSR lines increased to 2,182 km, thus the total length of HSR under operation reached 25,000 km. Additionally, China's “Renaissance,” which enjoys full intellectual property protection and operates at a speed of 350 km/h, was launched successfully in Beijing-Shanghai in June 2017 and runs on multiple routes.==== By 2020, China's HSR operation mileage is expected to increase to 30,000 km, covering more than 80% of urban areas with a permanent population of more than 1 million. Consequently, on the routes that overlap with HSR, China's domestic civil aviation passenger transport market will be greatly affected. The rapid development of HSR poses a challenge to the airline industry, which makes the competitive environment of China's airline industry more complicated and is expected to change the demand structure accordingly (Su et al., 2019). Therefore, competition from HSR is expected to change the intertemporal price strategies adopted by airlines.====Intertemporal price discrimination is diverse (Varian, 1989; Stole, 2007) and exists in many fields; the airline industry is no exception (Borenstein, 1985). In the early 1980s, scholars (e.g., Frank, 1983) warned that market concentration recognized differential pricing as equivalent to discriminatory pricing, and the lower the market concentration, the lower the ability to discriminate based on price. Subsequent research indicated that uncertain demand (Dana, 1999) and a competitive environment (Gerardi and Shapiro, 2009) are the main factors that influence airlines' price distribution (e.g., causing airlines to provide discounted fares early), and there is a negative correlation between price discrimination and market competition (He, 2016). At present, an increase in income has aggravated the uncertainty of high-speed passenger transport demand, and the rapid development of HSR has led to changes in airlines' competitive environment. In general, airlines analyze the present market environment based on travelers’ purchase history, which is similar to the definition of behavior-based pricing reported in Caillaud and De Nijs (2011): “offering differentiated prices to different customers on the basis of their previous purchase behavior.”====Airlines also adopt an intertemporal price discrimination strategy to sell tickets at the appropriate price to suitable travelers at the appropriate time to maximize revenue based on customer groups' (different willingness to pay) purchase history. Therefore, studies on the relationship between fares and booking dates have convincingly shown that airline ticket prices increase with departure date proximity (Button and Vega, 2007; Malighetti et al., 2009), indicating that travelers' willingness to pay increases with departure date proximity. Business and leisure travelers generally have differing elasticities of demand (Yuan and Wei, 2014). The number of business travelers generally increases two weeks before flight departure, whereas leisure travelers purchase tickets earlier (Salanti et al., 2012). Notably, scholars (see Chen and Schwartz, 2008) have also asserted that the increase in the willingness to pay based on the proximity of the flight's departure date is mainly because the travelers' perceptions and expectations of fares and flight availability change as the remaining time decreases, and this change is not affected by the type of customer.====Generally, economics experts in the field of air transport have always perceived that differential pricing can distinguish between business and leisure travelers (Salanti et al., 2012), and this discriminatory pricing is usually discussed under the concept of “revenue management” (see Holloway, 2008). If we assume that leisure travelers are more inclined to book tickets earlier than business travelers (Butter and Ison, 2008), we can conclude that airlines can maximize revenues through differential pricing. They achieve this by charging higher fares to those more sensitive to the departure date but less sensitive to fares (business travelers) and charging higher round-trip fares to destinations with relatively low price elasticity of demand (Luttmann, 2019).====For a single flight, these conclusions are almost indisputable and have led to insights regarding the welfare effects of dynamic pricing. From a welfare perspective, not all travelers are affected to the same degree. Compared to the high-competition route market, business travelers who purchase high-priced tickets eventually pay relatively low fares in the low-competition route market, whereas leisure travelers pay more (Hernandez and Wiggins, 2008). Low fares for leisure travelers (price-sensitive) can expand the overall size of the market to improve flight frequency and reduce unit cost (the use of larger planes), and high frequency is one of the factors valued by business travelers who pay high fares (Forsyth et al., 2002). Notably, with the continuous development of the economy and the innovation in transportation facilities, the market environment for airlines is changing, and more travel modes are increasingly available for business and leisure travelers.====Like in economics, where the same problem has different answers in different eras, the intertemporal price discrimination strategy adopted by airlines is unlikely to remain the same always. The emergence of HSR is disrupting the original market structure and fulfilling the increasing demand for high-speed transportation. Presently, HSR has become the main competitor of and substitute for airlines (Chen, 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Xia and Zhang, 2017; Jiang and Li, 2016; Jiang and Zhang, 2016) and has affected airlines’ market share, flight frequency, and fares (Gleave, 2006; Park and Ha, 2006; Dobruszkes, 2011; Behrens and Pels, 2012; Adler et al., 2010; Clewlow et al., 2014; Albalate, 2015; Wan et al., 2016; Yang, 2018).====Regarding HSR's effect on airfares, research has typically focused on average prices (e.g., Luan et al., 2012) and has been based on an in-depth analysis of competitive behavior between airlines and HSR using the dynamic game of complete information to analyze equilibrium pricing. Zhang et al. (2015) consider the airlines, HSR, and travelers' choice behavior as a Stackelberg game, studying the equilibrium pricing problem between airlines and HSR based on the traveler's choice behavior. To determine the impact of HSR on airlines' intertemporal price discrimination, Bergantino and Capozza (2015) studied the impact of Italian HSR on airfares, and they demonstrated that HSR competition leads to lower airfares and makes airlines' intertemporal fares increase sharply within a short time on highly competitive routes. Capozza (2016) analyzed the impact of rail travel time on airlines' pricing using daily panel data from the Italian passenger market and found that airlines' prices increase with rail travel time. Wei et al. (2017) analyzed the impact of HSR incidents on airlines' intertemporal fares using a difference-in-differences methodology and considered that HSR mainly acts as a low-end substitution for air travel in China. Zhang et al. (2019) showed that HSR competition in China makes the airlines' intertemporal fares' decline period longer and the increase period shorter, thus allowing airlines to maintain lower fares for a longer amount of time.====Scholars have studied the intertemporal price strategies adopted by airlines on different routes for different customer groups (e.g., business travelers and leisure travelers) and the impact of HSR on airlines' intertemporal price strategies. Notably, according to the current study's review of the literature on China's airline industry and based on the subdivision of customer groups, combining curve fitting and econometrics methods to empirically analyze the impact of HSR competition on airlines' intertemporal price has been rare. Therefore, we collected airlines' intertemporal price data, and, by defining the leisure index, calculating the variation coefficient and average price, and constructing the econometrics model, we could directly analyze the impact of HSR competition on airlines' intertemporal price. We also analyze how airlines, in the face of HSR competition, formulate intertemporal prices according to the characteristics of the route (e.g., distance, economic development situation).====The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it uses a large amount of unique data to empirically analyze the impact of HSR on airlines' intertemporal price strategy in China. China's HSR operational mileage accounts for more than 60% of the world's operational mileage, and passenger traffic volume exceeded 1.7 billion in 2017. China has the world's largest HSR market and the second-largest air passenger market. Therefore, we believe that, with regards to the effect of HSR competition on airlines' pricing, a Chinese case study is very relevant, and the research can be an important supplement to the literature in this field.====Second, this paper divides the airlines' customer groups, and, entirely and partially, analyzes the impact of HSR on airlines' intertemporal prices and average prices through the combination of curve fitting and an econometrics model. This enables us to present the effects to the reader in a more intuitive manner. Learning from Salanti et al.‘s (2012) hypothesis, we assume that fares changing within 14 days before the flight departure explain the change in business demand (i.e., the higher the price increase, the steeper the intertemporal price curve and the higher the business demand), and fares changing within 15–30 days before the flight departure explain the leisure demand situation.====Based on these assumptions, and by using our unique data, we calculate the leisure index of each flight by the curve fitting method and combine the result with the variation coefficient and average discount to analyze the impact of HSR competition on airlines' intertemporal prices and average prices from a general perspective. We further analyze the impact of factors such as urban development, route distance, and timing (i.e., weekday vs weekend) on the airfares within 14 and 30 days before flight departure. We also analyze the impact of the leisure index on the average fares and draw notable conclusions to affect policy formulation.",Effect of high-speed rail competition on airlines’ intertemporal price strategies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719300419,31 July 2019,2019,Research Article,449.0

An optimization model is developed to formulate the objectives of the three stakeholders, namely airports, airlines, and travelers, to evaluate the market outcomes in different cases. Leisure trip-chain travelers are specifically considered in the presented model, as such a group-level privatization approach has a greater impact on the decisions of trip-chain travelers. As a case study, we select the Hokkaido region in Japan, which is planning to privatize seven airports as a group in 2020, and estimate demand, the profits of airports and airlines, the consumer surplus, and the total surplus in the cases of public operation, airport profit maximization, and single-till and dual-till approaches. The results show that (1) multi-airports privatization enables operator to coordinate airport charges among the group to improve the total surplus. The optimal pattern of airport charges can vary according to the proportion of potential leisure demand. (2) The positive impact of airports’ ==== coordination in a dual-till approach is more limited than that in a single-till approach. (3) Airport charges may not be coordinated in the case of airport profit maximization, even when potential leisure demand is very high; this decreases the consumer surplus and total surplus.","Airports were traditionally owned and operated by the public sector. However, following the rapid growth of air transport industry, airport privatization has recently become a worldwide trend (Graham and Morrell, 2016), with some countries such as the United Kingdom, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand privatizing most of their major airports (Galeana, 2008; Forsyth, 2008). Moreover, driven by potential profitability such as cost reduction through centralized accounting, the trend toward multi-airports company and group privatization has also appeared. Especially when airports within the group are in a region, group operation may not only reduce airport competition and enable the operator to gain market dominance, but also make traffic coordination among airports possible (Forsyth et al., 2011). Such approach can be found around the world. For instance, BAA, the first privatized airport authority, operated multiple airports in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 2012, while Aeroportos e Navegação Aérea, which operates ten domestic airports in Portugal, was privatized through a concession contract in 2013.====Despite the potential benefits of privatizing as a group, multi-airport privatization has also aroused much controversy, as market dominance might be a double-edged sword. Cruz and Sarmento (2017) argue that multi-airport privatization can have a negative impact from the perspective of social well-being maximization. Increases in airport charges erodes the economic value of the infrastructure, although it maximizes cash-flow for the private investor. Starkie (2008) discusses the issue in the UK and shows that competition among airports appears to have worked well and led to a dynamic industry, while the joint ownership of airports by BAA adversely affects potential competition, which would exist between airports such as Glasgow and Edinburgh. He thus advocates restructuring ownership to provide a less concentrated, more competitive industry structure. Forsyth and Niemeier (2016) also show that break up of joint ownership of multi-airports can have some positive impacts on performance through opening up the possibility of competition, even though they doubt the extent of benefit in a short run. Indeed, the post-privatization unbundling of BAA, when three member airports were forced to be sold, supports these opinions.====However, in some cases of multi-airport privatization, for instance, the planned privatization of seven airports in Hokkaido, Japan, relations between target airports are complementary rather than competitive, as these airports are located in fairly remote places in a region and have different positioning. Moreover, if the multi-airports to be privatized are in a tourism region, the benefits brought by traffic coordination might outweigh the negatives brought by monopoly; as many tourists tend to visit multiple places during their journey, a joint decision-making of airport managers might facilitate the formation of air network that adapts to the trip-chain travel pattern of travelers. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no studies consider such a case where multi-airports in a tourism region are privatized by a single operator, despite its importance.====To bridge the gap, we investigate how multi-airport privatization in a tourism region would affect the regional air transport market after considering the trip-chain behavior of travelers, adopting the future privatization plan in Hokkaido, Japan as a case study. More specifically, we want to know whether the existence of trip-chain travelers can set traffic coordination feature of multi-airports privatization apart, rather than the monopoly feature. In our study, an optimization model is developed to simulate an air transport market in different situations. In the model, the objectives of stakeholders (i.e., airports, airlines, and travelers) are formulated and the interactions between them are simulated. Leisure travelers likely to visit multiple locations during one journey are specifically considered. The decisions of each stakeholder are endogenously optimized by a payoff maximization and we evaluate market outcomes such as demand, the profits of airports and airlines, and the consumer surplus and total surplus in the cases of public operation, airport profit maximization, and the single- and dual-till approaches.====We find that multi-airport privatization enables operator to coordinate traffic by coordinating airport charges among the group members to improve the total surplus. The optimal pattern of airport charges can vary according to the proportion of potential leisure demand (PPL demand hereafter). The positive impact of airports’ pricing coordination in a dual-till approach is more limited, than that in a single-till approach. However, airport charges may not be coordinated in the case of airport profit maximization, even when potential leisure demand is very high; this decreases the consumer surplus and total surplus.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We find that the scheme will not result in an efficient level of abatement and propose an additional measure that will incentivize in-sector emission abatement opportunities that cost less than the social cost of carbon (SCC). The proposed measure sets benchmark emission intensities (CO==== emissions per revenue ton kilometer) by route group and facilitates flexibility in meeting the benchmarks by allowing airlines to sell permits if they operate more efficiently than the benchmarks, and buy permits if they do not meet the benchmarks. The CO==== benchmark system could operate concurrently with existing measures to mitigate aviation CO","In 2009, the International Air Transport Association set goals to achieve carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards and to reduce emissions in 2050 by 50% relative to the 2005 level (IATA, 2009). As the industry growth rate is expected to outstrip efficiency improvements, global aviation emissions are projected to grow by 322% between 2006 and 2050 under optimistic technology and operational improvement assumptions, and by 347% under moderate improvement assumptions (ICAO, 2009).====To help achieve its emission reduction goals, the 39th ICAO Assembly agreed to a market based measure known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2016 (ICAO, 2016a). For the period 2021 to 2035, the CORSIA sets out requirements for airlines to fund reductions in CO==== emissions elsewhere to compensate for aviation CO==== emissions above the 2020 level through the purchase of carbon offsets. The proposed formula to determine the number of offsets that an airline must purchase is a weighted average of the growth factor for that airline and the industry-wide growth factor.====Although the CORSIA is a step in the right direction to abate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it will not result in an efficient level of emissions abatement from either the perspective of the aviation industry or society. From an industry point of view, the level of abatement is efficient when the cost of the last unit abated is equal to the price of offsets. However, as the costs of each airline's emissions are partially borne by other airlines under the CORSIA, the agreement will not incentivize airlines to implement all abatement options that cost less than the price of offsets until 2030 at the earliest and perhaps not at all.====As is well-established in economic theory (Pigou, 1920), a socially efficient level of emissions abatement occurs when the marginal cost of abatement is equal to the marginal benefit of avoided damages, which is approximated by the social cost of carbon (SCC).==== This will not occur under the CORSIA for two reasons. First, the price of offsets, especially in the near to medium term, is likely to be much less than the SCC. Consistent with this view, Jörgen et al. (2019) estimate that existing international climate policies for aviation will not deliver any major emission reductions. Second, even if the price of offsets was equal to the SCC, as noted above, airlines will not exercise all abetment options that cost less than the offset price.====Several studies have investigated the economic and environmental effects of aviation climate policies. For example, Albers et al. (2009) evaluate the impact of EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) on EU airlines. Malina et al. (2012) analyze the impact of extending the EU ETS to international aviation on US airlines. Winchester et al. (2013) estimate aviation outcomes under a proposed US climate policy. Chin et al. (2013) evaluate alternative rules for allocating emission permits to airlines included in the EU ETS. Scheelhaase et al. (2018) compare emission and economic outcomes under the EU ETS for aviation with those under the CORSIA. Scheelhaase (2019) assesses measures to regulate both CO==== and non-CO==== gases. Jörgen et al. (2019) review international and national climate policies for aviation.====To our knowledge, however, the economic and social efficiency of the CORSIA has not been previously analyzed. We fill this research gap by deriving the marginal incentive to abate emissions under the CORSIA and proposing a measure that will result in an efficient level of emissions abatement that can operate concurrently with the CORSIA.====In this paper, we outline a benchmark CO==== intensity system with tradeable permits that incentivizes a socially efficient level of emissions abatement from international aviation. The proposed system sets benchmark levels of CO==== emissions per revenue ton kilometer (RTK) for aviation route groups. Airlines that operate below the benchmark intensities are awarded permits and airlines that emit more CO==== per RTK than set out by the benchmark are required to purchase permits. Trade in permits among airlines will lead to a market permit price, and the stringency of the benchmarks are set so that permit price is equal to the SCC. This system can operate simultaneously with the CORSIA and other aviation mitigation measures.====The proposed benchmark CO==== intensity system applies the SCC to a fraction of each airline's emissions rather than all emission. Accordingly, an aviation benchmark CO==== intensity system provides a blueprint for efficient emissions abatement elsewhere that is more palatable to industry groups than other policies that apply the SCC to all emissions, such a carbon tax. As aviation emission abatement options are expensive relative to those in other sectors (Winchester et al., 2015), the aviation industry has a strong incentive to ‘lead the way’ in imposing a socially efficient carbon price and ultimately preserve the Earth's limited capacity to absorb GHG emissions for its own use. Other benefits from a benchmark CO==== intensity system include: (i) it provides an (optional) additional lever to address ‘fairness’ concerns in assigning emission abatement obligations to airlines, (ii) it reduces the number of offsets required for the industry to achieve carbon neutral growth; and by pricing emissions at the SCC it may (iii) improve the aviation industry's relationship with consumers and investors, and (iv) prevent governments from imposing more costly policies on the aviation industry in the future.====This paper has four further sections. The next Section highlights incentives to reduce emissions under the CORSIA and outlines why this scheme will not result in an efficient level of emissions abatement. Section 3 discusses the motivation for the aviation industry to price marginal emissions at the SCC. Section 4 outlines the proposed benchmark CO==== intensity system.

Findings on the set of critical nodes provide key insights for vulnerability of the network, especially in the context of regional coordination against various natural and manmade risks.","Air passengers and cargo carried by three major countries in Northeast Asia, i.e. China, Japan, and South Korea, have significantly increased in the past decade, accounting for nearly 20% of the passenger and 38% of the cargo traffic worldwide as of 2017 (ICAO, 2018).==== In contrast to the growing importance, there exist few regional studies on the characteristics of the Air Transport Network (ATN). Existing studies that have dealt with the ATN in this region mainly focused on the national airspace of China. Wang et al. (2011) analyzed the topological characteristics of the Chinese airport network. The study found that the Chinese airport network as of 2007 showed the small-world property, but is not scale-free. Cai et al. (2012) conducted a comparative study on the Chinese network by comparing airport versus air route network. The study found that two networks significantly differ in their topological nature; airport network follows the power-law degree distribution, and has high clustering coefficient and short characteristic path length. On the other hand, air route network follows the exponential degree distribution, and has low clustering coefficient and long characteristic path length.====One of the novelties of Cai et al. (2012) is considering not only the airport but also the air route in modeling ATN. ATN as network of airports has been widely employed in abundant literatures, both in the global (Lordan et al., 2014, 2015; Song and Yeo, 2017; Sun et al., 2017) and the regional (Dai et al., 2018; Wilkinson et al., 2012) context. Although airport network exhibits the desirable scale-free and small-world properties in general, virtual networks of directly connected airport pairs essentially model airline service network to exclude the airspace, where most of the operational resources are consumed. To address such shortcoming, several studies adopted enhanced approaches in constructing airport network. Pien et al. (2015) modeled the European ATN as network of airports and ACCs (Area Control Center). Ren and Li (2018) applied clustering techniques to aircraft trajectory data, and used the cluster size as the edge weight of the airport networks of China and the United States.====There have been notable efforts to model ATN more directly from the airspace perspective. Sun et al. (2014) studied topological properties of national air route networks of 15 countries, which included China and Japan. Five network metrics of degree, closeness, betweenness, distance strength, and edge length distribution were considered, and the authors argued the degree distributions were closer to tetration than exponential. In the follow-up study, Sun and Wandelt (2014) expanded the scope to include 58 countries, and investigated the topological similarities of air route networks based on 15 network metrics. The study concluded that there exist few commonalities among the 58 national air route networks, and noted that robust assessment on the air route networks needs to incorporate such heterogeneity.====In this study, the Northeast Asian regional airspace is modeled as network of the Air Route Segment (ARS). ARS is the minimum unit to constitute an air route, and the international standard used in the Aeronautical Information Service (AIS). The regional Air Route Segment Network (ARSN) is constructed from the individual ARSN of China, Japan, and South Korea in a collective manner. Three variations of ARSN – unweighted, weighted by link distance, and weighted by link-wise air traffic volume, are considered to evaluate the robustness of the Northeast Asian ARSN based on node criticality. Although ATN robustness has been well explored and researched, there exist few literatures that have studied the Northeast Asian region. In addition to the geographical limitation, the majority of existing literatures focused on airport network robustness (Lordan et al., 2014, 2015; Sun et al., 2017; Wandelt et al., 2015). In the aforementioned study on 15 national air route networks, Sun et al. (2014) concluded that the United States is the most robust among 15 countries against random or targeted node failures, mainly due to relatively small betweenness values. In this paper, two measures of robustness – ‘the relative size of the largest component’ and ‘the number of operable flights’ are evaluated and discussed. If the former represents network cohesiveness in terms of connectivity, the latter represents the sustainability of flight operations in disrupted airspace. For a quick overview and comparison, related literatures are summarized in Table 1.====The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, Northeast Asian ARSN is modeled and the properties of three variations of the regional ARSN are presented. In Section 3, network robustness is discussed with respect to network cohesiveness as well as the air transport serviceability. Discussions and conclusions are included in Section 4.",On node criticality of the Northeast Asian air route network,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301085,18 July 2019,2019,Research Article,452.0

Understanding airport shoppers' satisfaction is thus becoming increasingly relevant for airport operators and remains largely unexplored in the academic literature. This paper contributes to the strand of the literature analysing the satisfaction of duty-free shoppers through a six-item construct that was modelled using a hybrid fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. A questionnaire was administered at the international terminal of a regional airport in Australia. The results show that the differences in terms of place of residence and passengers' destination route are factors influencing the level of shoppers' satisfaction. Residents in Australia and passengers travelling short-haul are more satisfied than non-residents of Australia and those travelling long-haul. With respect to each attribute, the satisfaction elasticities show that shoppers are more elastic in terms of the variety of items available in the shops and the choice of international brands; and satisfaction is less elastic with respect to the ease with which specific items can be found, as well as the ‘look and feel’ of the shops.","Since the 1990s, a wave of airport privatisation has hit many regions of the world, and private operators are chasing opportunities to increase non-aeronautical revenues (Graham, 2013). Consequently, the importance of commercial management increased at airports (Freathy and O'Connell, 1999), leading to high percentages of commercial revenues, which reached a world average of 47% in 2011 (Graham, 2013). Among the various non-aeronautical opportunities are retail (with an average global contribution of 28% in terms of the multiple sources of non-aeronautical revenues), followed by parking at 22% (ACI, 2015).====Within retail, duty-free is the most important source of income for international airports. For instance, at London Heathrow, duty-free revenues represent near one-third of the total retail revenue (Gleave, 2017). The contribution of duty-free revenues at international airports has encouraged airport operators, and their retail partners, to increase their interest in understanding the purchasing behaviour of travellers. In particular, airport managers are interested in knowing the factors that contribute to increasing duty-free shopping satisfaction and revenues.====To date, research on satisfaction in the context of airport duty-free shopping has not received much attention and has been limited to two airports in Asia: Seoul Incheon (Perng et al., 2010; Lin and Chen, 2013) and Taiwan Taoyuan (Lin and Chen, 2013). Different cultures have different service requirements and expectations (Lin and Chen, 2013), which need to be well understood by airport managers to provide excellent service.====This empirical research measures airport duty-free shoppers' satisfaction and the elasticity of satisfaction concerning six attributes at one international regional airport. The chosen geographical location is Australia, where airport privatisation took place in the 1990s, with many airports having achieved high levels of commercialisation and non-aeronautical revenue generation. This research contributes to the literature providing further insights from Australia through the use of a different methodology (the hybrid fuzzy TOPSIS).====The aim of this empirical paper is threefold: (1) to understand the satisfaction of airport duty-free shoppers in a commercially driven environment; (2) to analyse the influence of travel patterns in shopping satisfaction; and (3) to find critical success attributes to enhance the satisfaction of airport duty-free shoppers.",The role of travel patterns in airport duty-free shopping satisfaction: A case study from an Australian regional airport,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718304526,18 July 2019,2019,Research Article,453.0

However, there is no conclusive evidence when the airport is located in a region with large diaspora and outbound tourism. To gain insight into the relationship between LCCs and international tourism demand, we analyse whether a causal relationship exists between the number of international LCC passengers at the Porto airport and international tourism demand in the Galicia-North Portugal Euroregion using a vector ====. We evaluate the dynamics of the impacts of the LCC international passengers on international inbound tourism demand in a tourism demand model framework. The main findings are that the number of LCC international passengers has a positive influence on the number of nights spent by international guests in hotels and similar establishments and that the calculated monthly average injection of money into the economy is between 3 and 4.1 million € for North Portugal and between 1.4 and 2 million € for Galicia (Spain).","The liberalization process of air transport is one of the main driving forces of low-cost carriers’ (LCCs) passenger growth rate (IATA, 2017; ICAO, 2016). It is also considered the main cause of an increase in the number of routes, and of the reduction in ticket prices (Halpern and Graham, 2015). Consequently, whereas LCCs approximately transported 1 out of 5 passengers worldwide in 2007, that figure increased to more than 1 out of 4 passengers ten years later.==== LCCs showed a higher market share in Europe with 1 out of 3 passengers in2017.====Researchers agree on the fact that attraction of tourists relies on the existence of transportation at the right price (Martin-Cejas, 2010; Halpern and Graham, 2015; Lohmann et al., 2009; Hvass, 2014; Koo et al., 2017). This explains why authorities have designed policies such as the liberalization of air transport market (Dobruszkes and Mondou, 2013; Alsumairi and Tsui, 2017); subsidization of the development of airport transport facilities (ANA, 2000; ANA, 2007; Graham and Shaw, 2008); lower airport fees and marketing support (Graham and Dennis, 2010; ANA, 2013; Hvass, 2014; Farmaki and Papatheodorou, 2015) and/or direct subsidies to airlines (Francis et al., 2004; Castillo-Manzano et al., 2011; Duval, 2013; Ramos-Pérez, 2016). The aim of all these policy measures is to increase injections of money into the economy in the form of tourism spending.====It is widely argued that LCCs lead to an increase in tourism demand and injections of money in traditional tourist destinations (Bieger and Wittmer, 2005; Aguiló et al., 2007; Vera-Rebollo and Ivars-Baidal, 2009; Donzelli, 2010; Graham and Dennis, 2010; Rey et al., 2011; Chung and Whang, 2011; Alsumairi and Tsui, 2017; Tsui, 2017).==== However, some scholars pointed out that groups of LCCs passengers such as visiting friends and relatives (VFR), students and second home owners that use free private accommodations or second homes generate smaller injections of money into the circular flow of income than tourists staying in hotels and similar establishments (Seaton and Palmer, 1997; Briggs, 2002; Kotler et al., 2006; Farmaki and Papatheodorou, 2015). Furthermore, residents of the airport's area of influence visiting other destinations (outbound tourism) may also be among the LCC passengers and instead of serving as an injection of money, outbound tourism withdraws money from the circular flow of income. Specifically, Dobruszkes and Mondou (2013) and Hazledine and Collins (2011) analyse examples with large diasporas==== and conclude that in such cases, injections are smaller (leakages larger) due to VFR.====In general, there is no conclusive evidence in the empirical literature about the effects of the increase in the number of LCC passengers on the injections into the circular flow of income if there is a large diaspora, a high share of VFR, second home owners and outbound tourism in the number of LCC passengers. Additionally, there is scarcity of research focus on the boost for tourism provided by LCCs and based on time series econometrics and appropriate statistics (Dobruszkes et al., 2019).====In our paper, we estimate the effects of the number of international LCC passengers that arrive at Porto's airport on number of nights spent by international tourists in hotels and similar accommodations (excluding tourists that stay in free private accommodations or second homes such as second home owners or some VFR) within a tourism demand model framework and using cointegration. Better understanding of the impact of LCCs and tourism routes can be of great assistance in planning development strategies in the tourism industry and airport management, specifically the role of the LCCs not only in the north of Portugal and Galicia but also in other regions. Although the analysis of LCCs and their impact on tourism is an area that shows a growing interest among researchers (Spasojevic et al., 2018), to the author's knowledge, this is the first empirical study that analyses these effects in a region that is not a main tourist destination and is characterized by a large diaspora. Our study extends the quantification of the effects of the existence of LCCs in Porto (Portugal) on the international tourism demand in the neighbouring region of Galicia (Spain).====Regarding the case of the airport of Porto, first, public subsidies to the airport and promotion of routes have played a major role in the evolution of the number of passengers at the airport of Porto (ANA, 2000; ANA, 2007; ANA, 2013) that went up from less than 3 million people in 2005 to over 9.4 million in 2016. LCCs passenger traffic started in 2005 and increased to over 6 million in 2016. Second, these public incentives have generated a social and academic debate concerning their efficiency in terms of promoting economic growth and, more specifically, generating tourism revenue. Third, the North of Portugal and Galicia have sizeable diaspora populations: approximately 1.7 million nationals from Portugal and 0.5 million from Galicia live abroad (Oliveira and Neves, 2017; IGE, 2019). Most of them live in Central and Northern Europe (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxemburg, Switzerland and the UK), which are the major Iberian Peninsula international tourism source markets and LCC routes from Porto's airport. Fourth, Carballo-Cruz and Costa (2014) reported that approximately 20% of the traffic are VFR. Fifth, private free accommodations and second homes represent 50.3% of the accommodations used by international inbound tourists to Portugal (INE, 2017) and Portuguese nationals or their descendants living abroad represent 23.4% of foreign residents that visit Portugal using air transport (INE, 2017). Consequently, the injections of money into the circular flow of income could amount less than planned by the authorities when they decided to attract LCC passengers to the airport of Porto.====If our study found a causal relationship between the number of international passengers carried by LCCs and number of nights spent by international tourists in hotels and similar accommodations, it could suggest that the designed policies to increase the number of international LCC passengers have effectively raised international tourism demand that clearly generates injections of money into the economy. On the contrary, no causality between the number of international passengers carried by LCCs and international tourists would imply that LCC passengers arriving at the airport of Porto do not stay in hotels and similar accommodations. If this were the case, the existence of LCCs would be good for the people transported (outbound tourists, VFR, second home owners and students) but would not bring the expected benefits for the tourism industry by increasing tourism expenditure at the destination.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: next section summarises the traffic figures of the airport and the catchment areas of North-Portugal and Galicia; section 3 describes the data and techniques used to quantify the effects of LCC passengers on tourism demand; the results and discussion section presents the findings and the concluding remarks complete the paper.",Low cost airlines and international tourism demand.

The model shows that the number of sequenced aircraft at the same time directly influences waiting times and makespan. In addition, factors such as landing time and operational restrictions modify the optimized sequencing as well as the waiting time of the aircraft on the ground. Particularly, the separation minima possibly become the major factor of influence when the SID is considered. Finally, by using Monte Carlo simulation it was possible to state that uncertainties related to taxiing time do not imply significant changes in the departure queue.","After landing, the aircraft taxis to the designated apron, where it is assigned to a stand beginning the turnaround. During this time, different procedures are performed, e.g., deplaning of passengers, crew members and baggage, ground handling services (cabin service, catering, ramp service, etc.) and preparations for the next flight. Following the end of the ground handling services, it is necessary to wait for the release to pushback procedure, in which the aircraft is maneuvered (by pushback tugs or tractors) from the stand to the taxilane. When the aircraft is aligned in the taxiway, it heads to departure queue, where it waits for the clearance to takeoff. Throughout this process the aircraft is submitted to various waiting procedures in queues or in remote areas, which result in: (i) increase the taxiing time, due to possible ground congestions, (ii) unnecessary fuel burn and consequently, (iii) a higher amount of gas emissions (Evertse and Visser, 2017). In addition, delays may increase the operational costs for airlines as well as result in losses to the passengers (Santos et al., 2017; Serhan et al., 2018).====According to Hansen (2002), the delay propagates to subsequent flights, so decreasing the delay of one flight will likely influence subsequent ones. Therefore, the total delay in subsequent flights will always be greater than the delay of a single flight; will be the sum of the delays of all flights. Likewise, the subtracted delay cannot be greater than the delay existing before a given flight, since flights cannot occur before scheduled (Hansen, 2002). As pointed out by Yu et al. (2017), congestions on the ground may result in severe delay and propagate to the scheduled flights. However, this problem may be solved/mitigated by an appropriate sequencing landing and take-off operations, which, in turn, tend to increase the efficiency of the runway.====The limitation of ground operations is one of the main factors hindering traffic operations (Yu et al., 2017). Rietveld and Brons (2001) found that large airports have longer waiting times than smaller ones, because the minimum connection times are longer at these airports, allowing airlines slack to decrease missing connections. Even with high capacity, if the airport does not have proper management of its operations, this can lead passengers to wait for long periods (Rietveld and Brons, 2001). Initiatives to manage and improve ground traffic operations help reduce waiting times at the landing and takeoff queues (Diana, 2013). Simić and Babić (2015) have observed that airports with segregated operations (landings and takeoffs on different runways) have shorter departure queues. However, the arrivals have longer taxi routes than when there are mixed operations, principally if there is only one runway. Arrivals have a large effect on the departures; especially in the apron area where the pushback process happens and can cause blockages (Stergianos et al., 2016). Ravizza and coworkers (2013) found that traffic has a significant impact in average taxi time, wherein arrivals tend to achieve higher average taxi speed than departures, due to the departures queues. Furthermore, the combination of parameters responsible for most of the variability of the taxi times may change from the position and rapid exit for landings to stand and runway for departures, as reported in the work by Lordan et al. (2016). Although the uncertainties related to ground operations, the one that carries the greatest impact on the taxi time of the aircraft is the route chosen for taxiing (Rappaport et al., 2009).====One way to solve the limitation of ground operations is to improve airport infrastructure, but it is costly and unnecessary when there are other alternatives, such as the use of technology and optimization approaches. Atkin et al. (2013), for example, presented a real-time decision approach to absorbing the delays at the stands instead of the holding area, when this exists, minimizing the waiting time and consequently the fuel burn. In this context, there is a continuous effort to find optimized solutions in airport operations for both landside and airside. Among the studies focused on the airside, one may consider four main optimization types, namely Runway Sequencing and Scheduling (Atkin, 2013; Atkin et al., 2008; Sölveling and Clarke, 2014; Zhan et al., 2010), Taxi Route Planning (Roling and Visser, 2008; Smeltink et al., 2004), Gate Assignment (Mirkovic, 2011; Narciso and Piera, 2015; Tang and Wang, 2013), and Aircraft Taxi Scheduling (Khadilkar and Balakrishnan, 2014; Simaiakis et al., 2014).====In the literature, it is possible to find works aiming to minimize possible congestions on the ground, which can be used as making decision aid in real time. For example, one may cite the works of Khadilkar and Balakrishnan (2014) and Simaiakis et al. (2014), which present models of aircraft release to departure. However, the routes traveled by each aircraft to the runway were not considered by these authors. On the other hand, the works of Smeltink and coworkers (2004), Roling and Visser (2008), Lobato and coworkers (2015) and Evertse and Visser (2017) calculate the aircraft path on the ground, i.e. the entrance and the exit between the runways and the aprons. Nonetheless, these models do not take into account the arrival sequence of the aircraft in the takeoff queue.====Even though in a smaller amount, there are works that combine the movement of aircraft on the ground with the optimized sequencing in the takeoff queue. For example, it may be mentioned models presented by Yu and Lau (2014), Bosson and Sun (2016) and Benlic et al. (2016), although they have the same subject, the three works observe the aircraft dynamics in different ways. The works of Yu and Lau (2014) and Bosson and Sun (2016) consider only constraints related to the wake vortex to sequence the departure queue. In turn, the work of Benlic et al. (2016) considers the separation between aircraft according to the SID (Standard Instrument Departure), in addition to the wake vortex constraints. However, none of these studies considered the MPS - Maximum Position Shift (Balakrishnan and Chandran, 2010; Neufville et al., 2013). This is a strategy to avoid large deviations from the initial position of the pushback requirement of the aircraft by restricting the maximum number of positions the aircraft can shift during the sequencing process, relative to its original position (Atkin, 2013). The absence of this consideration in the aircraft sequencing may not be well accepted from the point of view of the airlines, since the aircraft release according to FCFS (First Come First Served) is considered fair (Balakrishnan and Chandran, 2010). That is, the first aircraft to request release is the first aircraft to be serviced. In addition, these three works consider time windows to group the aircraft that must be sequenced. Even though this approach carries uncertainties of the request for pushback or compliance with the flight planning since these time slots are limited based on scheduled flights.====In this context, this research aims to propose a real-time model, based on the Machine Job Shop Scheduling for sequencing the departure queue considering the taxiing time of each aircraft, Maximum Position Shift (MPS), landings and operation restrictions. Differently from the models commonly found in the literature (Atkin, 2013; Sölveling and Clarke, 2014; Zhan et al., 2010; Capri and Ignaccolo, 2004), the model here presented is a non-iterative model, which reduces the required computational resources, because it does not require repetition or iteration of any process to achieve/refine the final result. This provides a simple and fast tool to assist the air traffic controllers in the ground position to manage the ground movement. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used to assess the major factors of influence in the queueing process for each airport. To assess the use of the proposed model in a major airport, data from São Paulo International Airport (GRU/SBGR) were used. This model can be a great aid to air traffic controllers since, to the best of the author's knowledge, the models in the literature focus on more complex and computer time-consuming strategies.====This work is divided into 3 topics besides this introduction. Section 2 focuses on the first considerations about the general problem, presenting the hypothesis and the formulation of the model, along with aspects of the case study and the sensitivity analysis. In Section 3, the results of the case study are presented, with a discussion concerning the variables of influence.

With civil aviation authorities (CAA) closing airspace, the event impacted 48% of total European air traffic, with more than 100,000 flights cancelled within just a week (Bye, 2011). While the extent of the event was unprecedented, the potential impact of volcanic ash emitted by volcanoes in Iceland had been recognized (Sammonds et al., 2010).====E2010 led to increased awareness of the threat of volcanic ash to air traffic in Europe, and numerous advances have taken place since then with regards to research, regulation, and cooperation (Bolić and Sivčev, 2011; Ulfarsson and Unger, 2011; Reichardt et al., 2017). According to the updated procedures, European airspace now remains open and the decision-making on whether to fly or not is with the aircraft operators, providing their Safety Risk Assessment (SRA) has been approved by the corresponding CAA. One of the measures taken to anticipate future events is the annual volcanic ash exercise (VOLCEX).====The VOLCEX exercise is conducted roughly once a year and rehearses the initial response to a volcanic eruption in Europe, biannually practicing on an Icelandic eruption. In a preparatory meeting, the stakeholders agree on a scenario to be tested. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) in London runs the NAME model (see Methods) for the eruption scenario in agreed weather conditions (interview with representatives from UK Met Office, October 2014). VOLCEX involves air navigation service providers, air traffic control centers, civil aviation administrations, meteorological offices, VAAC London, VAAC Toulouse, and aircraft operators worldwide.====These exercises are under the supervision of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and practice its current contingency procedures during the two-day exercise (EUROCONTROL, 2016). The exercise focuses on the air traffic response to the onset of a volcanic eruption with ash emission. However, volcanic eruptions can impact the air traffic beyond that initial phase, as the E2010 event demonstrated. Recent studies link global warming and deglaciation with the possibility of increased volcanic activity in Iceland (Pearce, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2013; Compton et al., 2015), leading to conclusions that an eruption similar to or greater than E2010 could in the future occur more than once per decade (Schmidt et al., 2013).====This study developed two extreme-case scenarios based on Icelandic volcanoes. One investigates situations in which air traffic is interrupted over a long period of time; in the other, the event is of shorter duration but with much greater intensity and ash volume. The scenarios are developed in light of the work done by Schnaars (1987) and Ramirez et al. (2010). The term ‘scenario’ is defined according to Ramirez et al. (2015) as a “structured conceptual system of equally plausible future contexts […], presented as narrative descriptions […] to provide input for future work.” The scenarios present a “strategic planning tool for decision-making under risk” (Brauers and Weber, 1988). Using scenarios in discussions with stakeholders allows consideration of long-term perspectives (Öborn et al., 2013) and the exploration of potential surprising elements along the way (Schweizer and Kriegler, 2012). Ultimately, the aim is to perform applied research that is useable by practitioners (Sandberg and Tsoukas, 2011).====Eruption scenarios can be developed in different dimensions, e.g., as a “possible range of activity” of one volcano, such as in Biass et al. (2014), or as an extreme case of an eruption. Extreme-case scenarios in this context describe scenarios that feature above-average spatio-temporal dimensions of ash distribution due to a combination of eruption intensity, duration, and selected meteorological patterns. The approach to the scenarios was selected to capture the “what if …” discussion following an eruption of high intensity as well as an eruption of long duration. In order to expand the preparation beyond recent disasters, the scenarios were set up to go beyond the boundaries of normal expectations, by using a thousand-year timescale to identify possible extreme but historically realistic events (Gudmundsson et al., 2008; Thordarsson and Höskuldsson, 2008).====This article draws on research started in a project on the response of the aviation sector to volcanic eruptions, a case study within the ENHANCE project, Enhancing Risk Management Partnerships for Catastrophic Natural Disasters in Europe (Reichardt et al., 2016).====In the following section, the selection of the scenario parameters is explained. Then the graphical outcome of the scenario modelling is presented and the potential impact of the modelled ash distribution is discussed. The focus of this paper is the development of the extreme-case scenarios, the visual demonstration of the potential impact of the selected scenarios, and the resulting weaknesses that could be identified in current volcanic ash response exercises. The presentation and discussion of these scenarios in a workshop with various air traffic stakeholders have been described (Reichardt et al., 2018).",Developing scenarios to explore impacts and weaknesses in aviation response exercises for volcanic ash eruptions in Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969971730474X,28 June 2019,2019,Research Article,457.0

Following the rapid growth of the industry, there has been a significant increase in the number of universities offering aviation management programs and enrolled students (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2).====Aviation management programs can play a crucial role in the development of the aviation industry. Hence it is of great importance to analyze and understand the factors affecting the relationship between aviation industry and aviation management programs of universities.====Organizational practices are influenced by the institutional environment which consists of a set of regulations, norms, standards, values, codes, expectations, procedures, routines, and beliefs (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Scott, 2001). They are also influenced by the institutional logics which are defined as “the socially constructed, historical patterns of material practices, assumptions, values, beliefs, and rules by which individuals produce and reproduce their material subsistence, organize time and space, and provide meaning to their social reality” (Thornton and Ocasio, 1999, p. 804). In case of a partnership or a collaboration, partners' actions, decisions, and interactions are guided and legitimized by the institutional environment and institutional logics (Greenwood et al., 2010 as cited in Clark, 2015). Similarly, in case of a university-industry collaboration, institutional dynamics and institutional logics have an important impact on the collaborations between industry and academy (Bjerregaard, 2010; Bruneel, D'Este and Salter, 2010; Sauermann and Stephan, 2013; Vallas and Kleinman, 2008). There have been several studies on the collaborations between aviation industry and higher education institutions offering aviation programs (e.g. Araujo, 2012; Bromfield and Belberov, 2017; Caymaz and Erenel, 2012; Mott, 2014; Secundo et al., 2012). Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study that specifically focuses on the relationship between aviation industry and aviation management departments of universities. Thus, this study aims to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between the aviation industry and the aviation management programs of universities in Turkey. In addition, the impact of institutional environment and institutional logics on the collaboration between academy and industry in different industrial and national contexts must be explored better than the exploited hitherto (Bjerregaard, 2010; Bruneel, D'Este and Salter, 2010; Sauermann and Stephan, 2013; Vallas and Kleinman, 2008). Therefore, another aim of this study is to contribute to the literature by showing how institutional dynamics and institutional logics are shaping the relationship between aviation industry and academy.====The paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we provide a review of related literature where the literature gap is explored. In section 3, we explain the research methodology including data collection, sampling, and analysis. In section 4, we present research findings.

A service level is specified to control the number of days that the ULD safety stock requirement can be violated. The network model and solution algorithm are developed with parallel computing. We find that our solutions are an improvement over the current solutions employed by the studied carrier from 31.89% to 33.01% for different safety stock levels. We also conclude that the studied carrier should set the service level to 90% as the general standard for stations considering the tradeoff between the number of ULDs required and the violation days.,"The unit load device (ULD), including pallets and containers, is an essential piece of equipment for airline operations, necessary for loading passenger baggage and cargo into the aircraft. In practice, the number of ULDs required will vary from airport to airport depending upon the number of flights, the type of aircraft, and the amount of passenger baggage and cargo that have to be handled at each operating airport. It is thus necessary for the airline to move ULDs between its operating airports to satisfy these requirements. An inferior dispatching plan could result in either a shortage or an excess of idle ULDs at an airport. A good dispatching plan should help the airline enhance utilization and reduce the total number of ULDs required in actual operations.====To deal with any imbalance between outbound and inbound freight amounts, an airline usually holds onto a certain number of ULDs as a buffer, as part of its monthly safety stock. However, the number of ULDs required each day can vary considerably and may be higher or lower than the level of the safety stock. If there are enough ULDs to completely satisfy the safety stock requirements for all days in a month, the total number stored at the airport must be large, which is uneconomical in scale. Therefore, the airline must also consider the service level, usually calculated as a percentage of the number of days that the safety stock requirement can be violated (i.e., be less than the safety stock required) in a month. For the studied airline, a service level of 90% is commonly used at its operating airports, meaning that there are 3 available violation days in a month of 30 days. The matching of violation days to timetables, ULD requirements, and ULD dispatching is considered in this study. Given the specific service level for each operating airport, the model is designed to help the airline make the best selection of violation days for each airport so as to avoid an over-abundance or a shortage of ULDs in actual operations.====The role, characteristics, and influence of ULDs in the airline industry have been discussed in past studies, for example by Nobert and Roy (1998), O'Connor (2001), Allaz (2004), Ashford et al. (2011), Baxter (2011), Morrell (2011), Chang et al. (2011), Ashford et al. (2013), Reynolds-Feighan (2013). Recently, Baxter et al. (2014) discussed the development of fire resistant ULDs. They analyzed two developments for fire-suppression: fire resistant containers and pallet fire containment covers. The interest in fire-suppression for ULDs is in response to concerns for aviation safety, to help suppress fires and provide pilots with sufficient time to deal with the fire emergency. Baxter and Kourousis (2015) examined the technological development of temperature-controlled aircraft ULDs for use in global air cargo cool chains. They not only discussed technological and technical innovations for the development of temperature-controlled aircraft ULDs but also analyzed the role of ULD manufacturers in response to global air cargo cool-chain requirements.====However, the airline ULD dispatching problem, which is unlike the above studies, has rarely been considered in the past. Roongrat et al. (2008) used a simulation model to evaluate airline ULD inventory based on a minimum ULD loading configuration policy. They also tested several minimum configuration levels designed to help airlines reduce the ULD shortages and counter the amount of imbalance in the operating network. Lu and Chen (2011) considered the airline ULD dispatching and scale problem. They used the time-space technique to formulate the potential movement of ULDs between airports. Weekly planning was considered, with a given level of safety stock at each station, maximum aircraft capacity in area units and payload, ULD requirements for each flight, estimated freight and luggage for each flight, and so on. Lu and Chen (2012) considered an estimation problem for airline ULD safety stock. They applied the flow conservation technique and Chebyshev Theorem to determine the ideal level of ULD safety stock for the studied airline's operating airports. Specifically, Roongrat et al. (2008) and Lu and Chen (2012) focused on determination of the ULD inventory and safety stock, which can be viewed as an upstream problem of Lu and Chen's (2011) and of the problem discussed in this work.====Lu and Chen's (2011) is the most similar to this current study. A comparison is made which illustrates the specific contributions and differences between our study and theirs which are as follows:====We develop an a ULD dispatching model to help the airline efficiently dispatch ULDs between its operating airports. The objective is to minimize the total number of ULDs required in actual operations. Given a service level for each airport, the selection of violation days for the safety stock requirement is considered. The chance-constrained programming and the associated linear transformations are used to formulate the service level and violation days. Because of the large-scale of problems resulting from actual operations, we first decompose the original network into four subproblems and then develop a solution algorithm to successively solve for solutions. Parallel computing is also applied to improve the computational time. Finally, numerical tests associated with the airline's different levels of safety stock are tested. The violation days and different service levels including three situation analyses for specific stations and days are also discussed. The proposed model which considers the service level and violation days, network decomposition, and the solution algorithm are original, and are not found in the literature on the airline ULD dispatching problem. In addition, this is the first study to discuss the managerial implications of the determination of the violation days and the service level, which provides a useful reference for airline ULD operations.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The modeling is discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, we introduce the network decomposition and related propositions. In Section 4, we introduce the solution algorithm. The numerical tests are described in Section 5.

For example, as shown in Fig. 1a in Australia, 44.2 million domestic air passengers were carried in 2006, growing to 60.0 million in 2017 (Bureau of Infrastructure Transport and Regional Economics, 2007, Bureau of Infrastructure Transport and Regional Economics, 2017). However, as shown in Fig. 1b, the total number of domestic Regular Public Transport (RPT) air passenger carried on the top six regional air routes in Western Australia (WA) experienced a considerable decrease from 2.3 million in 2012 to 1.7 million in 2017, a 26% fall over 5 years. The drivers of this decline remain uncertain; whether it is that travellers are switching to other modes of transport, or travelling is becoming less frequent due to population change, or the underlying economic demand or differing work practices is unknown. Previous literature suggested that competition between air and road transportation (e.g., car, coach) is increasingly intense due to increasing passenger numbers and the continuing development of the road transportation system, especially for short or mid-distance travel routes (defined as less than 1000 km) (D'Alfonso et al., 2015; Jiang and Zhang, 2016). In WA the 415 km journey between Geraldton (a regional centre) and Perth (the primary metropolitan area), the driving time is approximately 4.5 h while the corresponding flight takes 55 min (excluding waiting time and travel to and from the airport), as an example. WA's setting is important because the distances involved in travelling between towns and cities are significant and should, in principle, make flying particularly attractive (and the waiting time at airports relatively less important). Although air transport can save time relative to road travel, it generally costs more, particularly direct and marginal costs. Therefore, the decision around travel mode choice depends on a range of parameters including travel time, travel cost, accessibility, seat comfort and service frequency (Pels et al., 2000; Hess et al., 2007; Chang and Sun, 2012; Van Can, 2013). Additionally, the choice process may differ based on the purpose of the trip (Van Can, 2013; Jung and Yoo, 2014). For instance, it may be that business travellers are less flexible and thus consider time as the primary concern. Conversely, for the non-business or leisure travellers, they may value travel cost as the priority while making the travel mode choices. Thus, for this competitive passenger market, passengers' sensitivity or preference to these key factors is becoming particularly important for government policy makers and airlines to understand.====Many studies have investigated passengers' travel mode and airline choice between cities, states and or countries (Hess et al., 2007; Lapparent et al., 2009; Chang and Sun, 2012). However, limited research has applied discrete choice modelling for estimating individuals’ mode choice behaviour within regional WA. A further limitation of the existing literature around flight travel preferences is that much of it is based on respondents recruited in airport and/or train stations, which may be valuable for certain questions but is subject to selection bias and may not generalise to the rest of the population (Hess and Polak, 2006; Hess et al., 2007; Koo et al., 2010; Van Can, 2013; Jung and Yoo, 2014). In this study, we surveyed respondents in both regional airports and other settings likely to involve those who do not frequently choose to fly (e.g., shopping centres, libraries, on the streets, technical education colleges and visitor centres).====The aim of the paper is to investigate the travel mode choice and behaviour of travellers on competitive routes serviced by air transport in regional WA. To do this, we use a discrete choice experiment (DCE), a widely used tool in the modelling of transport preferences. In order to achieve this aim, we have developed three objectives. Firstly, discrete choice models including Multinomial logit (MNL) and Nested logit (NL) models were used to estimate and compare business and non-business travellers' mode choice behaviour among car, bus and two unnamed regional airlines for intrastate trips within WA. Secondly, we compared model fit statistics between MNL and NL models in order to find out which one can provide a better overall model fit and thus is more appropriate for estimating mode choice. Finally, we investigated the differences in travel mode choice behaviour between air and non-air passengers (community respondents) by estimating their willingness to pay for different transport modes and the characteristics of each. Although this study modelled the travellers’ model choice in Western Australian context, the findings of the study may be applied to other geographically and socioeconomically similar regions to provide insight for government policy makers and airlines seeking to influence travel behaviour.",Do air passengers behave differently to other regional travellers?: A travel mode choice model investigation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301255,18 June 2019,2019,Research Article,460.0

Therefore, ==== country and presented case studies country.","The sector of air transportation has recorded significant increase over the past decades. After the deregulation and regulatory liberalization air fares dropped and low cost carriers (LCC) which offer low air fares emerged. Low air fares, higher living standards in large emerging markets, as well as growth of tourism and travel are all driving forces behind air travel demand. Air transport is mainly driven by economic and income growth, and at the same time it can counter-influence their growth. Furthermore, this industry has played an integral role in the creation of global economy, as a major economic force, in terms of both its own operations and its impacts on related industries (Belobaba et al., 2009).====The growth in the aviation industry has positive effects upon passengers, as it offers a variety of destinations. In general, positive effects generated by each stakeholder (airlines, airports, air traffic management (ATM), aircraft manufacturers, etc.) in the system of air transport are reflected in the wide range of jobs offered. Unfortunately, environmental impact of air transport can generate negative effects. Therefore, the humanity is challenged to accommodate steadily growing traffic and its impacts considering different, usually opposing criteria. Furthermore, each stakeholder by itself faces the problem of making decisions in an environment where there is a variety of alternatives and numerous, opposing or incomparable criteria. In the environment where demand for air transport is growing, airlines need to decide what aircraft to use on what route, what level of service passengers find to be satisfactory, what route to operate, which strategic partner to choose, etc. On the other hand, airports need to decide what to do in case a location for an activity is to be selected, how to set proper service levels, or to improve their operational performance or competitive position in the market, etc. Furthermore, ATM daily faces congestion problems that need to be solved with adequate level of safety. Therefore, it is obvious that there is a need and there is space for employing different multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods to assist decision makers in finding a satisfactory solution. MCDM methods are often used as an aid when solving different categories of decision problems that can arise in various fields. In recent years MCDM methods have been used to help decision makers organize and synthesize information in a way which leads them to feel confident about making decision, while balancing multiple criteria (factors) that are usually conflicting (Belton and Stewart, 2002). Having in mind that MCDM have been widely used in diverse areas, expectedly, various review papers were published in the past. These papers usually refer to application of specific MCDM method in various fields. Apart from reviews of specific MCDM methods, there are a few papers that consider application of different MCDM techniques to a specific area, or problem. In addition, some papers compare various MCDM methods. It is revealed there is the gap in the literature related to air transport, which motivated the author to analyse and review papers in which MCDM methods are applied to problems arising in the aviation industry.====Whereas some authors make difference between multiple objective optimization (MOO) problems and MCDM (or multi-criteria decision aiding/analysis - MCDA), that differentiation is followed in this research. The techniques that are presented in this research are categorized as MCDM, while other techniques that are used to solve tail assignment, fleet management, crew scheduling, aircraft routing or hub allocation problems are classified as MOO problems and they are not included in the analysis. This paper focuses on the problems that multi-criteria decision-making/aiding deals with, and which have finitely many alternatives that are explicitly known (Ehrgott, 2005). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present the application of MCDM methods to different decision problems that emerge in the aviation industry.====In this paper, the literature is comprehensively searched with the following key words: airline, airport, aircraft, and ATM combined with MCDM. The papers are collected from academic library databases including Sciencedirect, Emerald, Springer-Link Journals, Ebsco, and Wiley online Library, as well as from the Web of Science database. It should also be noted that the search was limited to the journals that have free accesses at the University library.

Findings showed that daily task, relational, and cognitive crafting were positively related to daily OCB though the mediating process of increasing job resources and challenge job demands. Our post-hoc analysis revealed that the proposed mediating model was more viable than the alternative causal model. These findings offer novel insight for job crafting and OCB literature.","In the airline industry, flight attendants play a central role in providing passengers with service (Karatepe and Eslamlou, 2017; Woo, 2019). As flight attendants' jobs are characterized by high levels of workload and physical and emotional labor as well as irregular and long working hours, they often experience burnout (Karatepe and Vatankhah, 2014; Kim and Back, 2012). Organizational scholars recommend job crafting to make flight attendants less exhausted and more engaged in work (Bakker, 2010; Karatepe and Eslamlou, 2017; Weseler and Niessen, 2016). Job crafting refers to “the physical and cognitive changes individuals make in the task and relational boundaries of their work” (Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001, p. 179). Distinct from traditional job design, job crafting involves proactive changes initiated by employees to deal with challenges in their work and make their jobs meaningful (Berg et al., 2010). Research has shown that job crafting has a positive ramification on crucial work outcomes such as job performance and work engagement in various kinds of occupations (e.g., Bakker et al., 2012, 2016; Chen et al., 2014; Demerouti et al., 2015a, 2015b; McClelland et al., 2014; Siddiqi, 2015; Tims et al., 2012, 2013a, 2013b). Consistent with these findings, flight attendants’ job crafting has been found to be positively associated with work engagement and performance, and negatively associated with turnover intentions (e.g., Karatepe and Eslamlou, 2017; Hur et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2018).====While these studies offer meaningful insight into the role of job crafting in the airline industry, two research gaps reside in the literature. First, previous research has mainly focused on work engagement and in-role performance as the outcomes of flight attendants' job crafting. Relatively little attention has been paid to the relationship between flight attendants' job crafting and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB====), which refers to discretionary, extra-role behavior that benefits others in the workplace (Organ et al., 2006). We argue that OCB is a crucial outcome that needs to be considered in the airline industry because flight attendants work as a team. As flight attendants need to respond to many demands from passengers (Karatepe and Eslamlou, 2017), voluntarily assisting other flight attendants whose service is poor or delayed can enhance passengers' satisfaction with inflight service as well as the overall service quality of the airline. Therefore, whether and how flight attendants' job crafting contributes to their OCB are important research agendas. More specifically, drawing on the job resources-demands (JD-R) model, we propose increasing job resources and challenge job demands as a key mediating process through which flight attendants' job crafting promotes their OCB. Thus, the objective of our research is to assess the mediating effect of increasing job resources and challenge job demands on the relationship between flight attendants’ job crafting and OCB.====The other research gap pertains to the timeframe of job crafting. Although mounting research has revealed that employees demonstrate daily fluctuations in the degree of crafting their jobs (e.g., Demerouti et al., 2015b, Demerouti et al., 2015a; Hetland et al., 2018; Makikangas et al., 2017; Petrou et al., 2012; Tims et al., 2014), the effect of flight attendant's daily job crafting has rarely been explored. This is a crucial omission in that flight attendants interact with different passengers on a day-to-day basis. The nature and content of their tasks are likely to vary daily depending on whom they deliver service. Nonetheless, research on daily job crafting to date has generally attended to the daily job crafting of regular employees who display relatively little within-person variations in job crafting. Considering the nature of flight attendants' job, we contend that flight attendants are a relevant target of daily job crafting research. Thus, the present study aims at investigating the relationship between flight attendants' job crafting, increasing job resources and challenge job demands, and OCB that unfolds at the day level.====In sum, the intended contributions of our research are threefold. First, it advances research on job crafting in the airline industry by illuminating the role of flight attendants' job crafting, which is an important but underresearched topic in the literature. Second, the present study complements research on flight attendants' job crafting by attending to OCB as a novel outcome of job crafting as well as uncovering the intermediary process linking flight attendants' job crafting and OCB. Third, our study is one of the first scholarly endeavors to elucidate the daily relationship between flight attendants’ job crafting, increasing job resources and challenge job demands, and OCB, which remains unknown so far.",Linking flight attendants’ job crafting and OCB from a JD-R perspective: A daily analysis of the mediation of job resources and demands,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719301802,7 June 2019,2019,Research Article,462.0

Moreover, the results show that an “entertaining” content is a key determinant of consumer brand post engagement on both social media platforms. The study points out the distinction between consumer brand post engagement on two of the biggest social media platforms and thus, provides a guide for the design and content of messages that could be used by airlines in building consumer engagement on Facebook and Twitter.","Social media grew phenomenally in just a few years. Users spent as much as 135 min on average per day on social networking sites in 2017, increasing from 90 min in 2012 (GlobalWebIndex, 2017). Since brands go where the consumers are (Ashley and Tuten, 2015), brands also increased their priority for social media marketing in recent years (He et al., 2013). Using social media is not only a relatively inexpensive communication approach (Parveen et al., 2015), it also opened up new opportunities for brands to extract value from existing and potential consumers by providing new ways for brands and consumers to engage with each other (Kabadayi and Price, 2014). Many consumers follow brands they like on social media, and can respond easily when brands post content on their official social media platforms by “liking”, commenting, and/or sharing the content in their network. The air transport industry is not an exemption. Airline companies have largely adopted social media (Grančay, 2014), and many of them have a strong and highly interactive presence on both Facebook and Twitter (Dijkmans et al., 2015b). As passengers use of airlines' social media is expected to increase in the years to come, so is airlines use of social media marketing (Seo and Park, 2018). Research on the air transport industry demonstrates that airlines’ utilize social media for many purposes, including customer service, brand building/consumer engagement, and providing relevant offers and deals (Bygstad and Presthus, 2012; Gal-Tzur et al., 2014; Grančay, 2014; Leung et al., 2013; Parveen et al., 2015).====According to Kumar et al. (2016), a dedicated fan base can significantly strengthen consumer–brand relationships and has a positive impact on consumer spending. For an airline, social media marketing activities has been shown to affect brand awareness and brand image, how passengers perceive the airline and to what extent they will post positive comments about, and recommend, the airline on social media (Seo and Park, 2018). Reactions (judgment and feelings) and relations the consumers form about an airline brand, and thus the airlines brand equity, is increasingly based on exposure to the airlines social media content (Dijkmans et al., 2015a; Dijkmans et al., 2015b). This shows the importance of air transport carriers being active on social media in engaging consumers. Top brands seem to focus on Facebook and Twitter, the two most important social media platforms on which users share content (Statista, 2019).====Liking, commenting, and sharing brand posts on social media are behavioral manifestations of consumer engagement (van Doorn et al., 2010), and critical for a brand's overall social media engagement strategy (Kabadayi and Price, 2014). Although academic research on consumer engagement on social media has increased lately (see e.g. Kumar et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018; Seo and Park, 2018), the impact of brand post design and content on a wider set of consumer engagement behaviors are still not very well understood (Luarn et al., 2015). Earlier studies on factors driving consumer engagement behaviors seem to limit their attention to liking and commenting behaviors (e.g. De Vries, Gensler and Leeflang, 2012; Kabadayi and Price, 2014; Sabate et al., 2014), and/or to engagement behaviors related to only Facebook fan pages (e.g. Kabadayi and Price, 2014; Leung et al., 2013; Tafesse, 2015). Further, research in the air transport industry demonstrates that airlines' social media approach can be different both within a segment (Leung et al., 2013) and across segments (Bigné et al., 2018; Gal-Tzur et al., 2014; Seo and Park, 2018). This points to a need for more research on factors influencing consumers' engagement to brand messages from different types of air transport carriers, which include, but are not limited to, empirical examinations of brand posts on Facebook and Twitter. Methods used in studies on social media in the airline industry vary including but not limited to consumer surveys (Bigné et al., 2018; Dijkmans et al., 2015a,b; Seo and Park, 2018), interviews with airline managers (Parveen et al., 2015), and content analysis and Web content mining/text mining (Bygstad and Presthus, 2012; Leung et al., 2013; Grančay, 2014). In the current study, we examine real brand posts from an airline and analyze how different types of posts content affects consumers' engagement behavior. Except for Leung et al. (2013), there has been few attempts to analyze airlines' social media brand posts in terms of consumers' engagement behaviors. While Leung et al. (2013) analyze Facebook posts related to three low-cost airlines, we analyze Facebook and Twitter brand posts from Icelandair, a major Nordic airline. Icelandair has positioned itself as an airline offering a combination of low fares and full-service. According to O'Connell and Williams (2005), such a positioning creates an ideal scenario for passengers. Operating approximately 600 flights carrying 12,000 passengers every day (Icelandair, n. d), their business strategy is centered around its geographic location of Iceland, midway between northern Europe and the east coast of the United States of America, where it connects 23 gateways from North America to 24 gateways in Europe with Iceland serving as a hub (Icelandair, n.d.). Icelandair has a very active and progressive social media marketing strategy. They predominantly use social media to drive customer engagement and create brand awareness. The company also uses Facebook as a proactive platform which encourages consumers to report any problems or suggest ways to improve its services. Icelandair's social media strategy reflects its business strategy in that the social media team is not excluded from other teams or divisions, and thus well aware of overall operations (H. Ágústsson, personal communications, April 8, 2015). Based on the data from Facebook and Twitter, we investigate “likes,” “comments,” “shares,” “replies”, and “retweets” as the key dependent variables. The study offers a preliminary set of dimensions for comparing consumers' brand post engagement on the two different social media platforms. Seo and Park (2018) suggest based on their study that airlines should induce customers to interact more actively by developing more interesting social media marketing activities. Thus, the current study contributes on providing such insights as it investigates what type of content make consumers more likely to engage with brand posts on both Facebook and Twitter in the context of a major Nordic airline.====The paper has four parts.

More active management of end-of-life fleets can yield increased confidence in fleet capability and retirement timelines. This work provides fleet managers with a tool to manage remaining aircraft flight hours to yield a desired fleet retirement pattern. It solves an equivalent flight hour minimization problem using a mixed-integer linear programming model for a military aircraft fleet having a network with basing and mission type constraints. The model minimizes differences in remaining equivalent flight hours for individual aircraft in future years, thereby allowing a fleet manager to alter the timeline for retirement of individual aircraft. A relocation cost is applied to discourage excessive, costly aircraft relocations. The United States ==== A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft is used as a case study while disruptions such as deployments are modeled to show the methodology's robustness. This work proves that a fleet of aircraft with dissimilar utilization histories and varying amounts of remaining useful lifetime can be actively managed to change the time at which individual aircraft are ready for retirement. The benefit to fleet managers is the ability to extract additional lifetime out of their aircraft prior to retirement.","Military aircraft fleets are retired with little regard to remaining flight hours. This leads to unused residual life in multi-million dollar capital assets (Jardine, 2011), (Oakley-Bogdewic and Osman, 2015). An end-of-life fleet's retirement is triggered by political motivation, technological obsolescence or budgetary necessity. These triggers are often outside the control of a fleet manager. Previous work by the authors shows that these triggers can be forecast using aircraft utilization data (Newcamp et al., 2016a). Fleet managers can capture these data and use them to devise methods to extract additional usage from their fleet. One method is to actively manage the transfers of aircraft between bases and the employment of those aircraft at the bases. The Retirement Optimization Through Aircraft Transfers and Employment (ROTATE) tool developed by this research effort gives fleet managers the ability to optimize end-of-life aircraft usage while seeking a desired retirement date profile. The goal of this paper is to provide fleet managers with a tool to manage the remaining flight hours each aircraft in a fleet can fly.====The United States Air Force (USAF) collects large amounts of aircraft utilization data so the motivation for this work is to use those data to provide better fleet lifespan utilization. The USAF manages most of its fleets using equivalent flight hours (EFH). This measure combines flight hours with usage severity information. For example, a particularly strenuous one-hour mission may register as 1.3 EFH while a docile one-hour mission could be 0.8 EFH. Four separate USAF fleets with normalized remaining EFH are shown as cumulative distribution functions (CDF) in Fig. 1. This general CDF shape is similar for other aircraft fleets and is representative of the procurement rates of the aircraft.====The CDFs in Fig. 1 represent a snapshot in time, but as the aircraft are flown, their remaining equivalent flight hours decrease. The general shape of the CDFs shown is called “Ramp.” Fig. 2 shows a generalized representation of Ramp. If no intervention occurs, an aircraft fleet would see aircraft reaching zero remaining EFH in a steady stream. In practice it is impractical to frequently retire single aircraft, so like-aged groups are selected for retirement (Jones et al., 1991). This retirement pattern is called “Multi-Step” (Fig. 2). “Cliff” is a profile where all aircraft retire at one forecast time (Fig. 2). It occurs when increased usage is assigned to those assets with less accumulated usage. The Ramp pattern is achieved with little intervention from the status quo while the Multi-Step pattern can be modeled by repeating the Cliff pattern with subsets of the fleet population.====While Ramp retirement patterns require little intervention to the normal aging of a fleet, they are hard for a fleet manager to manage. Continuous dwindling of combat capability and underutilization of fielded support resources are disadvantages of the Ramp philosophy. Multi-Step retirement patterns can effectively retire entire operating units in each step, which makes unit deactivation and replacement more efficient than the Ramp. The disadvantage to a Multi-Step retirement is that it requires a great amount of coordination and political buy-in to retire groups of aircraft at the same time and with little remaining useful lifetime. The Cliff pattern is the hardest pattern to achieve because of the disparate nature of aircraft utilization rates across an enterprise. However, it is the most desired because fleet managers and policymakers report that it is the easiest to plan for. An in-depth economic analysis of each pattern has not been conducted.====To alter a fleet's CDF shape to more closely mimic a desired retirement pattern, a fleet manager may employ two approaches. Aircraft may be transferred from one base to another and aircraft may be assigned to a different mix of mission types. Previous work showed that aircraft experience different EFH demands at each base in a fleet's network and that mission types flown also impact EFH accumulation (Newcamp et al., 2016b). A fleet manager may therefore choose to transfer aircraft between bases and alter the expected mission type assignments to change the aircrafts' expected utilization.====This work proposes a single-period mixed integer linear programming model to alter the remaining EFH CDF of a fleet. The model is used to transform a fleet from an existing Ramp pattern to a Cliff (and by association Multi-Step) pattern. Cliff was chosen because the customer for this work, the USAF, views Cliff as the historically most common method of retirement. The scope of this optimization problem is:====In this problem, demand is modeled as the set of mission requirements at an air base. Supply is modeled as the set of capital assets and their corresponding remaining EFH. Because the network demands change with time, the single-period model is employed in a multi-period simulation. Inputs to the model are free to change for each simulation period. The problem is stated as follows: given an existing fleet of aircraft and an existing network of basing locations, minimize the distribution of EFH subject to realistic operational constraints. A relocation cost (in EFH) is included in the objective function to realistically model the trade-off fleet managers encounter when deciding to relocate aircraft. This methodology uses mixed integer linear programming to influence the remaining useful life of a fleet of aircraft. The idea of relocating aircraft to impact utilization represents a new way to view the lifecycle of aging aircraft.====The remainder of this article is split into four sections. The Literature Review describes similar work in this field. Then the Methodology section presents the mathematical formulation and describes the inputs to the model. The Results and Discussion section shows actual A-10 Thunderbolt II case study results and also highlights the model's robustness given unplanned disruptions to the model. Lastly, the Conclusions section synthesizes the findings and highlights areas for further research using this approach.",Retirement optimization through aircraft transfers and employment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303120,4 June 2019,2019,Research Article,464.0

This study examines the On-Time Disclosure Rule for airline on-time performance which ranks airlines based on how well their flights arrive/depart on time. The program creates incentives for airlines to pad their flight schedules and artificially improve their reported on-time performance. Using a discrete choice demand model for air travel, we investigate how schedule padding affects consumer preferences. We find that schedule padding is associated with negative consumer welfare effects, reinforcing the notion of an unanticipated gaming behavior by firms that ends up harming consumer welfare.","Following the airline industry deregulation of 1978, flight delays in the U.S. domestic airline industry became a major issue. Although considerable investments have been made to continuously upgrade the U.S. air transportation infrastructure, this endeavor to expand capacity has not kept pace with the large increase in air travel demand (Skaltsas, 2011). The widening gap between capacity and demand ultimately became untenable in the 1980s and led to widespread flight delays (Mayer and Sinai, 2003). Airlines received a lot of negative press at the time and in response, legislation was passed on airline on-time performance (OTP).====In 1987, the U.S. Congress passed the On-Time Disclosure Rule (Title 14, Part 234 of the Code of Federal Regulations====) which requires U.S. carriers with one percent or more of domestic passenger revenue to submit monthly Airline Service Quality Performance Reports to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (Shumsky, 1993). The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) makes these monthly carrier OTP reports publicly available on its website with airlines being ranked on how well their flights depart/arrive on time.==== By making these results available online and through the media, the BTS expects that consumers can gain access to carrier OTP information in a timely way and with little cost.====The initial reporting requirements mandated airlines to submit information about their scheduled and actual departure/arrival times, flight cancellations and diversions. In January 1995, the reporting requirements were amended to include ==== delayed/canceled flights due to mechanical problems and ==== taxi and airborne times, along with the aircraft's tail number. Ensuing amendments followed. In June 2003, the Air Carrier On-Time Reporting Advisory Committee defined five broad causes of flight delay and required airlines to identify the corresponding delay cause for every late flight.==== Finally in November 2008, a tarmac rule was put in place to prohibit U.S. airlines operating domestic flights from letting an aircraft on the tarmac for more than 3 h without deplaning passengers.====The Department of Transportation (DOT) uses the flight data it collects from airlines to issue monthly reports that rank them (airlines) based on the percentage of their flights that arrive at the gate with less than 15 min of delay. These rankings appear frequently on local and national media outlets where a typical news report would refer to the percentage of on-time flights of airlines and would emphasize which airlines progressed or declined compared to the others. Furthermore, carriers with large market presence in a local city tend to have outsized media coverage from local news outlets. Performance and reputation matter to carriers, and an airline recognized for high ranking in the DOT's on-time arrival rates tends to enjoy a positive public perception about its service quality, which in turn may increase the demand for its service and translates in higher passengers' willingness to pay.====Quality disclosure programs like the On-time Disclosure Rule play the important role of signaling quality, especially in industries where consumers have limited information on product quality. Many studies suggest that quality disclosure programs facilitate the matching between consumers and sellers in industries such as restaurants, education and healthcare (Dranove and Jin, 2010). However, less research supports the view that sellers respond to quality disclosure programs by improving their product quality provision. The extant literature points, instead, to an inadvertent gaming behavior by firms that ends up harming consumer welfare. More recently, Forbes et al. (2015) investigate airlines' response to the On-time Disclosure Rule. They found that the program creates incentives for airlines to focus their efforts on flights close to the 15-min threshold.==== For some airlines, this threshold behavior is stronger in the presence of employee bonus programs for OTP improvement. This gaming behavior consists of firms engaging in manipulation in order to improve reported quality. While there exists a substantial amount of research corroborating how quality disclosure programs may influence the behavior of firms, this body of work has not explicitly examined how consumers respond to firms’ gaming behavior.",Airline schedule padding and consumer choice behavior,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718304952,27 May 2019,2019,Research Article,465.0

The objective of this study is to examine the relationships between proactive personality, safety attitude, safety climate, and safety behaviors among flight attendants. A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data from 547 flight attendants, all of whom work for China Southern Airlines Ltd. The results show that proactive personality has an indirect effect on safety behaviors through the influencing of safety attitude. It is also suggested that a positive safety climate weakens the effect of proactive personality on safety behaviors. The study's findings with regard to managerial implications are provided and discussed along with potential future research directions.","As the people who perform and manage cabin work, flight attendants play a vital role in in-flight safety and services. Consequently, flight attendant safety behavior is crucial to the overall safety performance of any airline (Kao et al., 2009). However, most existing researches, conducted from the perspective of the impact of organizational behaviors on flight attendants' work-related outcomes, have focused on organizational commitment, turnover intention, service performance, and work engagement (e.g. Chen, 2006; Chen and Kao, 2011; Macdonald et al., 2003; Xanthopoulou et al., 2008). Recent research into cabin crew perceptions of individual safety behaviors has proposed that flight attendant safety behavior includes in-role safety behavior (safety compliance) and extra-role safety behavior (safety participation or proactive safety behavior). Adhering to the safety policies and regulations issued by aviation authorities and airlines is considered to be the key element of a cabin crew's in-role safety behavior. Extra-role safety behaviors for cabin crew include promoting safety concepts and participating in their airline's safety programs during off-duty hours (Chen and Chen, 2014). Actually, an individual's perceptual orientation of safety behavior is better if they can maintain a high level of safety awareness. Judging and reporting potential hazards in a timely manner is also a key element of a flight attendant's safety performance, more so than that of their organizational behavior orientation. On that basis, some researchers have proposed the concept of mindful safety practices. This refers to the concept of promoting safe work practices, such as warning colleagues or putting work operations on hold if safety conditions become uncertain. In this way, some unwanted and unexpected events can be prevented or interrupted (Aase et al., 2005; Skjerve, 2008). Therefore, in this paper, mindful safety practices are considered to be an element of flight attendant safety behaviors.====Several traditional research methods have attempted to explain individual differences in safety behaviors. The personality trait approach emphasizes the predictive power of personality traits to the flight attendants’ own unsafe behaviors. Some studies have demonstrated that the personality traits of a cabin crew member may influence their job performance when it comes to controlling disruptive airline passenger behaviors (Rhoden et al., 2008). A proactive personality in a flight attendant has been suggested as being a positive trait for other variables, such as work perception (Chan, 2006), work-related learning (Parker and Sprigg, 1999), and service performance (Rank et al., 2007). In contrast, the social cognition approach focuses on studying variables such as attitude, perceived risk, social norms and perceived behavioral control. This method provides a basis for understanding how the studying of variables can act to influence safety behaviors (Ajzen, 1988; Parker et al., 1995). Ballard et al. (2004) found that the perception of occupation risk and safety motivation have an effect on flight attendant occupational health and safety behaviors. Ford et al. (2014) found that safety attitude training for flight attendants is a valuable tool that can be used to increase positive teamwork behaviors between the flight attendant and pilot sub-groups. However, recent studies have also found that both individual personality traits and individual social cognitive variables have a low interpretation rate in terms of flight attendant safety behaviors or safety performance (Clark, 2010; Rosenkrans, 2011).====There may be several reasons for the prediction of this single research orientation's apparent lack of success. One reason may be that the indirect effect of personality traits has possibly been underestimated with regard to flight attendant safety behaviors. In particular, the role of social cognitive variables in the relationship between personality traits and flight attendant safety behaviors has rarely been studied. Theoretically, personality traits (such as the attitudinal or normative determinants of behavior) should have an effect on an individual's social cognition (McCrae and Costa, 1995), which in turn can affect that individual's safety performance. Another reason for the possible low prediction of personality traits and social cognition to safety behaviors may be that the role of organizational variables has often been ignored when such researches are conducted. For instance, as an organizational factor, the term “safety climate” refers to the shared perception of the safety policies, procedures and practices in a work environment (Zohar, 2003). The safety climate has a profound impact on the safety attitudes, safety values and safety behaviors of all individuals in the organization.====However, few studies to date have attempted to integrate the variables from these different research traditions. The present study attempts to integrate the personality trait approach, the social cognition approach, and the organizational approach, in order to understand the mechanisms underlying flight attendant safety behaviors. Specifically, we focus on two research questions: Does proactive personality have an indirect effect on safety behaviors? Also, does the safety climate impact on the relationship between proactive personality and safety behaviors? To answer these questions, we propose a research framework, as shown in Fig. 1.",The effects of safety attitude and safety climate on flight attendants’ proactive personality with regard to safety behaviors,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718305428,27 May 2019,2019,Research Article,466.0

As the world moves toward a global economy, competition for trade is fierce among communities (Porter, 2000). Community leaders struggle to find innovative approaches to attract new industry to maintain viable communities (Engel, 2015; Porter and Kramer, 2011). Engel (2015) suggests community leaders can stimulate economic growth by developing place-making policies that leverage a community's assets. In separate studies, Hyer (2013), Kasarda (2000, 2006, 2011), and Wyman (2013) agreed with Engel's research and found place-making policies in the airport community and encouraged the development of the aerotropolis model as an important economic development catalyst.====The aerotropolis model centers on the airport as the economic catalyst to stimulate the local economy (Kasarda and Appold, 2014). The successful aerotropolis model provides an array of nonair-related services to the community by generating more revenue for the airport community than with just air-related services (Hazel, 2013; Reiss, 2007). Seeing the economic benefits of the aerotropolis model, policymakers of many airport communities are adapting the concept in anticipation that airports will be the new catalyst for economic growth (Freestone, 2009; Kasarda, 2000).====Although the aerotropolis concept is relatively new, first coined by Kasarda (2000) in the latter part of the 20th century, the root word “polis” originated during the Archaic Period of Greek history (Pozzi and Wickersham, 1991). The aerotropolis is an urban region in which the airport is the focal point of the economy (Kasarda and Appold, 2014). The word aerotropolis originates from the Greek words “aero” meaning “air” and “polis” meaning city (Robertson, 1991). In Ancient Greece, most residents of a polis lived in the city instead of scattered in small-farming communities (Nielsen, 2004). As the center of trade, the heart of the polis often meant the location of impressive buildings and other structures (Nielsen, 2004). The polis was often a place for sharing information for many of the residents (Nielsen, 2004). For Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle, the polis had more significance: the polis represented a community where all residents experienced happiness and gratification (Nielsen, 2004). In this sense, Kasarda and Appold's vision for the aerotropolis parallel that of Plato and Aristotle.====As airport communities implement the aerotropolis model, it is common for policymakers to focus on physical capital improvements to the area in and around the airport property (Gillen, 2015; Hyer, 2013; Kasarda, 2011). Many airport development projects such as runway extensions, new terminals, and other infrastructure projects related to airport expansion are either presently planned or under construction (Addie, 2014). Policymakers, however, often ignore the human capital assets required to contribute to the success of airport activity (Florida et al., 2015). In much the same manner policymakers overlooked the significance of the human capital assets to the aerotropolis, a majority of the existing research on aerotropolis model airport performance focuses on physical capital improvements and not human capital development (Kaplan and Rauh, 2013). This study is an expansion of earlier research on the impact of the aerotropolis model by examining the effect of airport commercial activities on the human capital assets of 35 airport communities classified as either an operating or developing aerotropolis or airport city in the United States (Kasarda and Appold, 2014).",Analyzing human capital as a component of the aerotropolis model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718305490,17 May 2019,2019,Research Article,467.0

Total passengers are used as a proxy for air transport demand. However, the ","Over the past few decades, the air transport industry has experienced significant growth. The expansion of international trade and worldwide travel boom are both driving factors of this growth (Xiao et al., 2014). In this shifting world, however, the pattern of air transport has been changing and becoming more complex (Xie et al., 2014). For example, there is not only competition (Park and Ha, 2006) but cooperation between aviation and high-speed rail (Z.-C. Li and Sheng, 2016). Moreover, many new airports are under construction and thus the present airports will face fiercer competition in a few years.====Air transport services have a perishable nature (Fildes et al., 2011). That is, once the aircraft takes off, the empty seats are an opportunity cost to the airline and cannot be stockpiled for sale at a later time (Anvari et al., 2016). At this time, the reasonable arrangement of the aircraft, improving the utilization rate and passenger occupancy rate of the aircraft are the key to reduce operation cost for aviation companies. Thus, an accurate forecasting of an airport's demand is of great importance, which can provide decision makers of aviation companies and local governments with valuable information and contributes to the development of optimal action programs (Xiao et al., 2014).====So far, there have been many models developed for passenger forecasting in multimodal transportation systems such as aviation, railway, highway and bus. Though these models can be classified according to different criteria, two classifications are the most common ones: (1) time series and causal analysis; (2) parametric and nonparametric models.====Time series methods utilize only historical data of the variable to be forecasted and extrapolate the trend of the data from the past into the future. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods (Anvari et al., 2016), (Tsui et al., 2014) and smoothing methods (Samagaio and Wolters, 2010), (Kim, 2016) are both typical time series methods. The basic assumption of ARIMA methods is that the more recent data have more impact on the forecasting value than the older data. Smoothing methods first remove irregular fluctuations in the time series and then use only the basic fluctuations to make forecasts. In contrast, since a transport system and the external conditions are always changing, causal analysis methods can be used to integrate more valuable information into forecasting. Such methods include regression analysis (Abed et al., 2001), causality test (Fernandes and Pacheco, 2010), logit model (Jovicic and Hansen, 2003), (Garrow and Koppelman, 2004), gravity model (Grosche et al., 2007), system dynamics (Suryani et al., 2010), etc.====As for the second common classification, parametric models presuppose the functional relationship between the variables while nonparametric models do not make assumptions about the form of the functional relationship. Most of the above-mentioned methods are essentially parametric models. Since the assumptions usually deviate from the reality, nonparametric models have an advantage over parametric ones to some extent (D. Li, Wang and Ismail, 2013), (Medeiros et al., 2008), (Chen and Chen, 2015), (Rahman et al., 2016), (Wei and Chen, 2012). For nonparametric models, several methods have been used to forecast passenger flows such as neural networks (Dougherty, 1995), (D. Li, Wang and Ismail, 2013), (Medeiros et al., 2008), (Chen and Chen, 2015), (Rahman et al., 2016), (Wei and Chen, 2012), nonparametric regression (Smith et al., 2002), (Clark, 2003), Kalman filtering models (Wang et al., 2007), Gaussian maximum likelihood (Y. F. Tang, Lam and Ng, 2003) and support vector regression (Vanajakshi and Rilett, 2007), (X. Jiang, Zhang and Chen, 2014). Among the nonparametric models, neural networks have attracted great attention of researchers due to their characteristics of adaptability, nonlinearity, arbitrary functions and mapping capabilities (Zhang et al., 1998). In recent years, many studies have combined neural network with other techniques forming extended models and thus boosted the development of neural network theory.====The time series of air passenger flows usually has a complex behavior due to their irregularity, high volatility and seasonality (Xiao et al., 2014). In view of this, this paper proposes a new forecasting approach on the basis of neural networks. In fact, neural networks can either be regarded as time series or cause analysis method depending on the number of variables considered. The independent variables used in previous causal analysis studies on passenger flows are generally limited to quantities such as GDP (Abed et al., 2001), (Duval and Schiff, 2011), exchange rate (Duval and Schiff, 2011), and population (Grosche et al., 2007). For forecasting air passenger flows, however, there are other variables that have not been considered thus far to form causal relationships. Forecasting based on such a limited number of variables face the difficulty that fluctuations in the time series may not be sufficiently forecasted, which leads to poor forecasting accuracy. One aim of this study is to diversify the input variables in air passenger flow forecasting. As discussed above, univariate models cannot make full use of the information available. However, that does not imply that variables are the more the better because there does not exist a positive relationship between the amount of information and forecasting accuracy. Thus, it is necessary to identify and extract relatively important variables. In this study, a method of mean impact value (MIV) based on neural network is used to select input variables. Based on this, we firstly propose a nonlinear vector auto-regression neural network (NVARNN) approach to forecast air passenger flows.====The contributions of this paper are mainly twofold: (1) a new forecasting approach, MIV-based NVARNN, is proposed, which outperforms single models and other hybrid approaches in terms of level forecasting accuracy, directional forecasting accuracy and robustness analysis; (2) to the best of our knowledge, several input variables used in this paper are firstly taken into consideration in the process of forecasting air passenger flows, and the empirical results have testified their effectiveness.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a MIV-based nonlinear vector auto-regression neural network approach. Section 3 applies this proposed approach to forecasting passenger flows of Beijing International Airport and compares its forecasting performance with several benchmark models.

An electric airplane is undoubtedly emerging in the aviation industry. For instance, British Airline EasyJet joined in bringing an electric airplane to the airline marketplace, collaborating with the US company, Wright Electric (Electrek, 2017; Lee, 2017a). Many major airline companies (e.g., Boeing) have also begun to support for the technology development of electric aircrafts (Lee, 2017b). McCall (2017), a chief executive of Easy Jet, clamed that “====” She also further indicated that a short-haul electric aircraft will soon be commercialized. Considering its geographical and environmental characteristics, it can be particularly suitable in the airline markets of Europe and North America where its local route and international route services are prevailing (Climateaction, 2017; Electrek, 2017). This electric transition is fast following the automobile industry. Similar to electric cars, electric airplanes are electric battery-based powered aircrafts. The electric transition of the airline industry is increasingly becoming a vital issue in the tourism industry and the entire transportation industry.====There is a high possibility that the worldwide technological war on electricity and battery systems occurring in the electric vehicle market will extend to the electric aircraft market as well. In the airlines industry where the fuel costs are high, the transition to electricity will be a key factor for success in the airline industry. The environmental pollution caused by high carbon emissions is another factor that could gradually restrict the use of fossil fuels. Hence, the emergence of electric aircrafts could lead to a change in customer preferences because electric aircrafts have cheaper air fares and they pollute less. Ultimately, the number of customers using electric aircrafts will increase. However, despite the various advantages of electric aircrafts, problems still remain that make the choice for consumers difficult. Customers cannot easily choose to fly in electric aircrafts because of problems, such as explosion risk of batteries, long charging time, performance change at low temperatures, and battery life. In other words, although it is expected that more customers will choose to fly in electric aircrafts owing to the cheaper fares and decreased carbon emissions, the lingering problems should be investigated to increase their use. Undeniably, consumers' attitudes shift and safety concerns are the critical elements for the success of electric airplanes as such concepts are directly associated with customer readiness for adopting this new airline product. Indeed, the essence of passenger attitude change (Duffy, 2017) and safety certification along with technology improvement (Lee, 2017a) in the process of commercialization of electric airplanes have been previously emphasized. It is irrefutable that airline companies therefore actively deal with such vital triggers and other important determinants of customers’ readiness/willingness to adopt electric airplanes, which eventually ensure the successful penetration of the electric-airplane flights into the increasingly challenging airline marketplace and generate long-term prosperity to the airline companies that are proactive for electric transition.====Such terms as readiness, willingness, likelihood, decision, and intention are often used interchangeably (Oliver, 1999, 2010). Existing empirical studies in the extant marketing, consumer behavior, and tourism literature extensively examined what drives customer readiness/intention/decision for the new/existing product (Hong, 2015; Jung and Han, 2016; Meng and Choi, 2016; Quintal et al., 2010). In these studies, perceived risk (Hong, 2015; Jung and Han, 2016; Laroche et al., 2004; Quintal et al., 2010), new product knowledge (Salazar-Ordόñez et al., 2018; Steenkamp, 1997), attitude toward the behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Meng and Choi, 2016), and trust (Akamavi et al., 2015; Evanschitzky et al., 2012; Lombart and Louis, 2014) were considered as key variables in customer intention formation.====Particularly, empirical cues in the existing consumer behavior studies indicated that patrons' perceived risk (or uncertainty of outcomes) can be effectively utilized for deeper understanding of their decision-making process for the adoption of new product (Jung and Han, 2016; Meng and Choi, 2016). However, empirical endeavor has never been chosen to evaluate the potential effect of perceived risk on customers' adoption intention for electric airplanes and pay intention for it. That is, the specific role of perceived risk and its constituents in explicating such behavioral intentions is hardly known. In addition, despite the criticality of the effect of new product knowledge on customer responses that precede their purchase decision stage (Gracia and De Magistris, 2007; Salazar-Ordόñez et al., 2018; Steenkamp, 1997), the potential effect of this construct on airline customer decision formation has little been examined. Moreover, while empirical studies that center on the impact of attitude and trust on customer product-choice decision/behavior exist (Ajzen, 1991; Han and Hyun, 2015; Lombart and Louis, 2014; Morgan and Hunt, 1994), little research has been devoted to investigating the role of these variables in the customer decision on a new airline product. Lastly, such vital factors as perceived risk, new product knowledge, attitude, and trust together have not been utilized to explain customers' adoption and pay intentions for electric airplanes. In this regard, the present research was motivated by the need to comprehend airline customers’ readiness to fly on an electric alternative of an airplane and pay for this new airline product.====Given this, the purpose of this research was to investigate the process by which airline customers adopt electric airplanes and pay conventional flight prices for such electric-airplane flights by exploring the impacts of perceived risk, new product knowledge, attitude toward electric airplanes, and trust. Specifically, this research aimed to identify the relative importance of these variables in determining customer adoption and pay intentions, to uncover the effectiveness of the higher-order structure of perceived risk encompassing functional/performance risk, physical risk, psychological risk, and financial risk as its first-order dimensions, and to unearth the mediating role of attitude and trust within the proposed theoretical framework.

The purpose of this work is to determine the loss of airport operational performance provoked by ground handlers' industrial actions. A discrete-event simulation model of both aircraft landing-and-takeoff (LTO) cycles and turnaround operations has been built by using AnyLogic. If the number of ground handler's operators decreases, turnaround operations require more time to be performed, resulting in delayed departures and knock-on delays. For the case study of Lisbon “Humberto Delgado” airport, turnaround time increases more than linearly with respect to the decrease of staff resources in service. When the number of operators decreases under a certain threshold, turnaround lengthening cannot be absorbed by buffer times and departure delays propagate in cascade over the day. This threshold should call for emergency actions and contingency plans.","Air traffic has been steadily growing in recent years, showing a growing demand and reliance on air transport in terms of both passengers and scheduled flights. With the increase in air traffic, also flight delays are continuously increasing, despite the special attention devoted to the topic. According to data from EUROCONTROL, in the first semester of 2018, ATM delays almost tripled with respect to the same period in 2017, reaching more than 47,000 min per day (EUROCONTROL, 2018a). By the end of 2018, approximately 14.3 million minutes delays are expected, with an alarming increase of 53% with respect to the previous year (IATA, 2018). The desired EU target delay for 2018 - i.e. 0.5 min per flight on average - is extremely unlikely to be achieved as, according to current forecasts, the European area will probably triple it.====Delays have significant repercussions on air transport performance in terms of efficiency, costs, safety and operations (Sandrine et al., 2007; Ball et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2015; Rodríguez Sanz et al., 2016). First of all, flight delays are likely to cause flight cancellation or a decrease in the number of available flights, therefore leading to a reduction in airlines’ revenues. According to a study carried out by Cook and Tanner (2014), on average delays cost European airlines EUR 100 per minute summing up to a network delay total cost of EUR 1250 million in the year of the study (Cook and Tanner, 2014). Delays impact not only on airlines, as late flights have a considerable impact also on airport passenger experience, customer satisfaction and system reliability (AhmadBeygi et al., 2008; Cook et al., 2009, 2012; Malandri et al., 2017). Passengers' discontent - missed meetings, lost personal time, anxiety and stress - may eventually undermine customers' loyalty and lead to up to boycott the airlines, with inevitable loss of business. In addition, delays to a leg of an aircraft rotation might have a multiplier effect on the system, causing further delays to successive segments and, finally, provoking knock-on delays, which is the phenomenon of delay accumulation in aircraft rotation (Wu and Caves, 2002; Adeleye and Chung, 2006). Also, from an environmentally sustainable perspective, both ground and airborne delays may imply an increase in airside operations and, as a consequence, additional fuel consumption, with a direct environmental impact through CO====, CO, PM and NO==== emissions (Postorino and Mantecchini, 2014; Postorino et al., 2016, 2018). Because of these reasons, there is growing concern about an unbearable increase in delays if insufficient focus is placed on the topic, i.e. by investigating how the different airport operations contribute to creating and propagating delays (Rodríguez Sanz et al., 2016; EUROCONTROL, 2018a).====One of the main sources of flight delays is related to turnaround operations, also referred to as aircraft ground handling activities (Adeleye and Chung, 2006; Schmidt et al., 2017). The latter are defined as the activities that take place in the period elapsing between the arrival and the departure of an aircraft at an airport. The punctuality of flight departures is significantly influenced by the efficiency and duration of turnaround operations, as flight departures might be delayed if turnaround activities are not completed on time. Turnaround efficiency is crucial not only for the enhancement of aircrafts' punctuality, but also for aircraft rotation stability and the maintenance of flight linkages (Eilstrup, 2000; Wu and Caves, 2002). An efficient turnaround is of paramount importance also to allow the preservation of the Minimum Connection Time (MCT) between flights, which is defined as the shortest time interval needed for a passenger and his luggage to transfer from one flight to a connecting flight (Horstmeier and de Haan, 2001). If, because of prolonged turnaround operations, the MCT is no more maintained, passengers may lose their flight connections. This is even more true for hub airports, where several waves of flights are expected to depart or arrive during the same period. Moreover, to optimize aircraft utilization, tight turnaround times between flights are required and this can increase the probability for subsequent flights to experience delays.====To limit potential delays from late inbound aircrafts and to reduce the likelihood of delays related to ground handling activities, an extra time is usually included in the scheduling, other than the time strictly required for turnaround operations. The positive influence of the so-called turnaround buffer time on the punctuality of aircrafts' turnaround is widely demonstrated in literature (Wu and Caves, 2000; Wu, 2005; Fricke and Schultz, 2009; Wong and Tsai, 2012).====The efficiency of turnaround operations is often compromised by various disruptive events out of the airlines' control, such as strikes or technical failures, which may negatively influence the punctuality and regularity of the operations, often causing serious delays and unexpected congestion. The disruptive events affecting air transport make operations substantially deviate from the schedule, causing the reduction of the system's capacity (thus, increasing flight delays). Up to November, in 2018 approximately 16% of delays in EU were caused by non-predictable disruptions (EUROCONTROL, 2018d), where the term “disruption” refers to those events defined in the remark field on the Network Manager Air Traffic Flow Management Regulation (EUROCONTROL, 2018c).====In particular, the attention of this work is focused on ground handlers' industrial actions. The latter provoke huge negative outcomes on the system as they affect not only one airline, but all companies serviced by the provider. Moreover, because of the complexity of the air transport system, a disruption of this kind in one airport is likely to quickly spread and multiply in cascade affecting other parts of the air transport network. For example, the industrial action carried out by ground handlers on 13 and 14 March 2017 at Berlin Tegel and Berlin Schönefeld caused the cancellation of approximately 920 and 500 flights respectively (EUROCONTROL, 2018b).====As pointed out by EUROCONTROL (2018c), actions and solutions are more and more required to successfully mitigate the effect of unplanned situations such as these. In order to understand how to minimize the impacts on passengers and economic losses due to disruptive events, the research field concerning the propagation of perturbations due to a disruptive event represents a major challenge in today system design.====The main objective of this paper is to provide a framework that allows to evaluate performance losses due to industrial actions of ground handling service providers, supporting the development of a methodology for estimating the consequences of ground handler's industrial actions at major airports. If personnel are reduced, the completion of turnaround activities requires longer time, provoking knock-on delays and gridlocks for the successive operations. This is much truer since personnel resources are tight and handling devices are partly specific for aircraft types, so that flexible reallocation strategies are limited.====Towards the main aim, the “as is” scenario is modelled and all main processes in the airport airside area are simulated. All main factors are included in the analysis in order to make the model as realistic as possible. A discrete event model is developed by using the generic simulation software AnyLogic. The developed airside model consists of two hierarchical sub-systems: the first one describes the LTO cycle from landing to take-off, while the second one represents aircraft turnaround operations, starting from the moment the aircraft reaches the parking position after landing. The model is capable of reproducing the operations depending on the number of personnel available to perform the operations.====The proposed model can be helpful to a variety of operational levels. At the implementation level, such model can be used to ensure efficient and sustainable airport operations under particular conditions. At a strategic level, it can be used to point out the critical features of the operations, like bottlenecks, deadlocks, interdependencies and therefore support capacity planning and deployment to design measures to prevent or successfully mitigate possible negative effects. The methodology should provide quantitative tools for: 1) forecasting and assessment of the impacts of ground handlers' strikes; 2) helping managers in undertaking the appropriate actions for their mitigation (structured contingency planning and preparation), in response to increasing cost pressure for aviation stakeholders.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides insight into the state-of-the art, describing the general turnaround process and reviewing existing modelling frameworks. In Section 3, the approach used to deal with the problem is explained and the model developed is described in detail. Section 4 presents a practical application of the model. Finally, Section 5 gives the main conclusions and discusses potential future research on the subject, as well as the utility and limitations of the study.",Aircraft turnaround and industrial actions: How ground handlers' strikes affect airport airside operational efficiency,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719300183,6 May 2019,2019,Research Article,471.0

We show that RM of low-cost carriers, which looks simple at a first glance, is indeed quite a sophisticated tool for extracting value from different demand segments, and thus, it is, for all ==== and purposes, a capability in the resource-based view.","Economists have often made the simplifying assumption that a firm can readily set the appropriate price (Bergen et al., 2003), such a view would suggest that pricing activity does not require special resources and should not be considered a capability in the resource-based view. By means of an analytical review of the literature, we argue that, at least in some industries, such a perspective fails to provide a realistic description of pricing as a firm's idiosyncratic function and of its role in securing a competitive advantage. The airline is one of such industries, being the one that first developed a set of strategies and tactics to constantly manage prices in order to increase both sales and margins (Talluri and van Ryzin, 2004).====Low-cost carriers (LCCs henceforth), such as Southwest in the U.S. or Ryanair in Europe, have had in the last decades a spectacular success. Nowadays, they both reach the top 10 ranking of airline companies according to a standard measure of performance in the industry, the revenue-per-kilometer (data for 2016, see IATA, 2017), thanks also to their strong leaderships.==== Being characterized by an apparently simple revenue management (RM), these companies seem to have challenged the notion that RM is a necessary capability to gain success.====Our review of the literature allows us to show that the RM of successful LCCs accounts for many route and flight characteristics, which can possibly evolve over time. That is, some of these, such as route length or departure time, are time invariant; while others, such as degree of competition, demand size and demand types, can change, even quite rapidly. As the network size and historical data on sales have become quite large, successful LCCs are involved to manage thousands of different flights per day and to determine a fare for each of these on the basis on their route and flight knowledge using billions of data. This reasoning suggests that the implementation of RM practice can be quite complex and difficult to replicate and therefore that it can be a capability in the resource-based view also for LCCs.====To sustain our claim, we will review the literature that shows how RM practices of LCCs vary with route and flight characteristics; and that the way in which RM practices are carried out to deal with these differences is consistent with a profit maximizing behavior of the firm.====The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the concepts of resources and capabilities. We discuss in Section 3 how RM is not just a resource of the firm, but rather a capability. Next, we focus our analysis on the airline industry. We follow a chronological approach and start with a discussion on the RM of full-service carriers (FSCs) in Section 4, moving on to an appraisal of the RM of LCCs in Section 5. This Section is the core of our review, as it inspects the empirical evidence on pricing strategies of LCCs. In the light of the previous evidence discussed, we are able to draw some general conclusions on RM by LCCs and its role as a strategic capability for these companies. Such key role is not questioned by hybridization and the recent evolutions in pricing strategies by LCCs, as argued in the following Section 6.

In the existing literature, investigating this specific underutilization problem has not received much attention from scholars in this field. Therefore, in this paper, we study this problem with two main objectives. First, to propose an Extra-baggage service as a solution to the underutilization problem. Second, to provide the associated prices for the proposed extra-baggage service. For this purpose, we adopt the newsvendor-based ==== model that explores different prices, while combining different amounts of extra-baggage and cargo in the belly-hold space. To demonstrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed service, a numerical simulation has been performed. The simulation includes comparing the expected profit from cargo allocation with the expected profit from the allocation of a combination cargo with Extra-baggage. The simulation results show a significant profit improvement for the airlines, while using the Extra-baggage scheme. This is apparent as the profit increases by 25% over the current excess baggage scheme. Moreover, the results show a double profit improvement in various seasons. This performance echoes the importance of the extra-baggage service being implemented in real practice.","In terms of service provision, airlines can be divided into three categories: i) All passenger airlines; providing passenger services, assigning the passengers in the aircraft upper-deck and allocating passenger bags into the aircraft belly-hold, ii) All cargo airlines; these airlines provide only cargo carrying service, and thus, they use only freighter aircraft which transports only cargo, and iii) Combination carriers; they provide both passenger and cargo services (Merkert et al., 2017). Combination carriers can be either Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) such as Southwest Airlines in the USA, EasyJet in the UK, and Air Asia in Malaysia, or Full-Service Combination Carriers (FSCCs) such as Delta in the USA, Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong, and Lufthansa in Germany. Both FSCCs and LCCs utilize the passenger aircraft belly-hold to carry cargo. They assign passengers to the aircraft upper-deck and allocate cargo to the belly-hold space side by side with passenger checked-baggage.====In regard to passengers, as a common service in all passenger and combination carriers, IATA (2016) expects that the passenger demand will grow from 3.8 billion passengers to almost double by 2035. Thus, the combination carriers have a great challenge in satisfying the rapid passenger demand. This challenge is felt in the limited airport capacity (Evans and Schäfer, 2014), and in constrained staff and fleet capacity (Kölker et al., 2016). One of the potential tools to face the demand upsurge is to replace the narrow-body aircraft with wide-body aircraft. Although wide-body aircraft accommodate a larger number of passengers, they have a larger belly-hold capacity compared to the narrow-body aircraft (Boeing, 2016). This coincides with reports which reveal that the cargo demand is not sufficient to cover the airlines cargo capacity (Air Cargo News, 2016; The Economist, 2016). Consequently, the large space in wide-body aircraft leads to an underutilization problem in the aircraft belly-hold. Moreover, in different seasons, underutilization in the aircraft belly-hold problem occurs and in some other seasons suffer from an over-capacity problem (hot-selling) (Feng et al., 2015). Furthermore, the world freighter usage is expected to increase from 1770 to 3010 freighters, i.e. 70% increase in the period (2016–2033), and the aircraft belly-hold utilization does not exceed the 50% as shown in Fig. 1 (IATA, 2017). The low load factor, in turns negatively influences the airline business performance, and the load factor increase enhances the overall saving (Totamane et al., 2014).====In this paper, we tackle the underutilized belly-hold capacity problem in the combination carriers. As mentioned above, the combination carriers load the passenger checked-baggage and the cargo into the aircraft belly-hold, but the cargo quantities are not sufficient to fill the belly-hold. Also, each airline has a different baggage strategy, and LCCs and the FSCAs also have different baggage strategies. On the one hand, the LCC does not offer baggage in the air-ticket, and the passenger pays for the baggage as an ancillary service. For example, in Easy Jet airline, the passenger pays from 11.56 to 43.7 USD==== to book baggage of weights from 15 to 40 kg, and it costs 12.5 USD for each excess kilogram over the pre-booked amount. On the other hand, the FSCAs offer checked-baggage to each passenger in the air-ticket. But the full-service combination carriers’ strategy sets a checked-baggage limit for each passenger. Additionally, each airline offers different excess baggage schemes for passengers who aspire to more weight.====The recent excess baggage service==== in FSCCs have different schemes among the airlines. To understand what the excess baggage is, the allowed checked-baggage should be introduced. In this aspect, an airline offers checked-baggage in pieces and/or weight. For example, on a single passenger air-ticket, the allowed checked baggage in some airlines is one-piece of 30 kg weight, and some others provide two pieces with 23 kg per piece. If the allowed checked-baggage is not sufficient, then the airlines offer different excess baggage schemes for passengers who wish to book more weight. Airlines offer excess baggage in two systems: A Pre-booking system where the passengers can book a limited amount of excess baggage in advance; and the penalty cost system, in which the passenger pays a high penalty cost for each excess unit of weight on the check-in counter. See Section 3.====The recent excess baggage prices in many FSCAs are exaggerated. For example, in some airlines, for only one-piece weight, e.g. 23 kg, on a certain flight may cost the passenger over 300 USD. The high excess baggage prices cause many passengers to use devious methods to avoid incurring extra-fees for their excess weight (Coffey, 2018). Moreover, the current excess baggage scheme is complicated. This complexity is clear in the frequent change in the pricing policies and the price values. For example, in Cathay Pacific (2018a), the pricing policy in July 2018 was to sell the excess baggage in 5 kg blocks, but by the end of August, the policy changed to sell the excess baggage in unit weight (kg). The same airline offers the price per excess weight (kg) in the flight leg as 12 USD to passengers who booked their tickets from February 2018 to May 2018, and this price increased by 2 USD for tickets booked after May 1st, 2018. Although the FSCAs provide excess baggage schemes, passengers cannot simply book their needs from the excess baggage over the ceiling decided by the airline (Cathay Pacific, 2018b). This ceiling prevents the passengers who are willing to pay from buying more excess baggage, instead, they either dispose of their belongings or send them via a logistics company. Indeed, usage of the excess baggage scheme by airlines does not help in solving the underutilization problem.====In the aspect of solving the underutilized belly-hold problem, we propose the Extra-baggage scheme to replace the current excess baggage. The Extra-baggage scheme solves the underutilized belly-hold problem by considering the Extra-baggage as a special cargo and relaxing the booking limits for passengers who need more space in the belly-hold.====Airlines already gain profit from offering the excess baggage service. For example, on a worldwide scale, the income from the over-weight bags, excess baggage, and other ancillary services reached almost 82.2 billion USD (Dailyhive, 2017). On the individual scale, Britons are charged more than £3.5 billion annually for their excess baggage (DailyMail, 2017), and the sum of US airlines's profit from excess baggage exceeded 4 billion USD in 2016 (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2016). Furthermore, many passengers need an excess baggage facility because of the last-minute souvenir purchasers, and the wrapping service users (Airports International, 2012). In Southern European airports, the majority of wrapping service users come from Africa, Gulf states, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Additionally, the free trade agreements between the countries concerned facilitate small-business scale in these countries (Trade and Industry Department, 2017), such as the Hong Kong mearchants travelling to South Korea to buy cosmetics (South China Morning Post, 2018). In this case, if these merchants want to gain more profit, they will buy larger amounts of products, and consequently, they will carry heavier baggage to the airport.====In fact, the business of carrying the extra-baggage should be a profitable one. Consequently, many logistics companies provide only an excess baggage carrying service, such as Excess Baggage Company (Excess Baggage Company, 2018), Send Your Bag (Send Your Bag, 2018), and Luggage Forward (Luggage Forward, 2018). Therefore, a simple and feasible Extra-baggage scheme is required to attract passengers to book more space for their extra-baggage. By implementing the Extra-baggage scheme, the airline is expected to share the Extra-baggage logistics companies profit, since passengers who want to transport their belongings can simply book additional space on the flight with the expectation that the belongings will arrive on their flight.====To offer this service, the airlines should take some key decisions, which are premised on answering the next two questions: what is the price of this service? And what are the most related services that can be used as a benchmark to set the new service price? Answering these two questions requires deep understanding of aircraft belly-hold space planning.====Usually, the belly-hold space is divided into different compartments, such as passenger baggage compartment, cargo compartment, and so forth. The cargo compartment has an estimated weight and/or volume capacity. The overall weight including the loaded cargo compartment must not exceed the aircraft MTOW====(FAA, 2016). Since the under-utilization problem occurs in the cargo compartment, it is suggested that the passengers’ Extra-baggage can fill up the cargo compartment.====In this regard, airlines use different Revenue Management (RM) techniques. RM is the way to allocate the available demand to the airline limited capacity in order to maximize the profit. Also, it is the method which supports the airline decision to sell the right capacity to the right consumer with correct timing (Sheryl, 2009). In this paper, we discuss the price of the proposed Extra-baggage scheme. For this purpose, and as commonly used in the literature, we adopt the Multi-item newsvendor-based pricing model to include the cargo and Extra-baggage services. We also explore the effect of combining different amounts of Extra-baggage and cargo on the airline's profit. In order to assess the potential of the proposed service, a numerical simulation is conducted.====This paper makes two contributions: First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper which establishes the theoretical basis for the excess baggage pricing scheme. Currently, these schemes are performed by the airline's top management. Therefore, a theoretical model is required to reduce the ambiguity of the current excess baggage schemes. Second, the model makes a modified Extra-baggage scheme by dealing with the Extra-baggage as a special kind of cargo. These significant contributions provide a solution for the underutilized belly-hold space with a known pricing pattern, and thus, the Extra-baggage price can use standard rates similar to the IATA Tact rates. Third, although the combination carriers carry both passengers and cargo, most of the research deal with each sector separately, and thus, the importance of the two sectors differs among researchers (Reis and Silva, 2016), while in this research, we consider that the two sectors are complementary. The advantage of the increase in passenger demand is taken to supplement the unused space in the belly-hold space by the mean of Extra-baggage.",Price setting for extra-baggage service for a combination carrier using the newsvendor setup,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718302370,19 April 2019,2019,Research Article,473.0

Latent Semantic Analysis - a text mining and categorisation technique ─ is applied to analyse online user-generated airline reviews. Over five thousand passenger reviews for fifty (50) airlines were collected from the online review site, TripAdvisor. Findings show that there are fundamental differences in the drivers of passenger satisfaction depending on the class of air travel purchased, and whether the airline is a low cost or a full service carrier. Friendliness and helpfulness of staff are the key factors for those travelling in Economy Class, product value is key for those in premium cabins, and a low price is the key satisfaction driver for those that choose to travel on a low cost airline. The research also shows that the service attributes seat comfort and legroom, luggage/flight disruptions and staff behaviours are the main reasons for passengers’ dissatisfaction among all groups. This study provides an alternative customer satisfaction analysis for managers to hear the voice of their customers by using a well-established text mining technique and by analysing the reviews of satisfied and dissatisfied customers.","Fierce competition in the airline industry requires effective customer relations management both online and offline to retain customer satisfaction, and so drive future income. Customer feedback, in particular, is critical since it is an actuator source for business growth and performance, improvement of customer experience and innovative product and service offerings (Siering et al., 2018). Satisfying passengers and translating this satisfaction into behavioural commitment is key for airlines to remain competitive.====There are numerous ways to asses and address customer satisfaction, and behavioural intentions. Managers generally rely on customer feedback both to identify future managerial goals and to monitor the performance of a firm through customer satisfaction and loyalty scores, such as Net Promoter Scores and average customer satisfaction scores (Morgan and Rego, 2006). The International Air Transport Association (IATA) provides a passenger satisfaction benchmarking study called Airs@t. The scale incorporates 70 travel attributes including pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight attributes of overall travel experience (IATA, 2018a, IATA, 2018b). In the academic context, various service quality frameworks—SERVQUAL, AIRQUAL, Kano and SERVPERF— have been used to investigate the relationship among airline service quality attributes, and satisfaction, and loyalty (Chiou and Chen, 2010; Chen, 2008; Park et al., 2004; Ekiz et al., 2006; Basfirinci and Mitra, 2015; Hussain et al., 2015; Rajaguru, 2016). Antecedents and drivers of airline passenger satisfaction and loyalty (Forgas et al., 2010; Mikulić and Prebežac, 2011; Akamavi et al., 2014; Vlachos and Lin, 2014) and/or airline service attributes (Vlachos and Lin, 2014; Medina-Muñoz et al., 2018) have also been investigated by a number of researchers. A large number of airline service attributes identified and used in the literature (See Appendix A) to analyse how these attributes lead to customer satisfaction, loyalty and willingness to recommend are either based on airline business model and/or service class, or are at an aggregated level. However, there is no agreement reached in the literature on which service attributes establishes service quality and satisfaction (Medina-Muñoz et al., 2018). It is critical to understand what the key service attributes leading to passenger satisfaction are and how they differ among different airline business models and service classes.====Online platforms (such as Twitter, Facebook and Skytrax) allow customers to share information, opinions, and knowledge about products, services and brands (Filieri and McLeay, 2014). Today, an increasing number of consumers read and share online travel-related content particularly if those are posted or created by their friends (Gretzel et al., 2007). Customer feedback and reviews on online fora are boosting the expansion of word-of-mouth (WOM) on the web (Filieri and McLeay, 2014). They are especially relevant for service industries because of intangible characteristics of services which include purchase risks (Nikookar et al., 2015). Sotiriadis and van Zyl (2013) found that online reviews and recommendations affect the decision-making process of tourists towards tourism services and WOM has a significant impact on the subjective norms and attitudes towards an airline, and a customer's willingness to recommend (Nikookar et al., 2015). According to the Pew Research Centre (2016), 82% of US adults tend to read online reviews and ratings prior to purchasing a product or service for the first time. In the US, reading reviews is particularly common for those who under 50. In the age group 18–29, 53% and in the age group 30–49 year 47% always read reviews when buying something first time. This proportion is lower in the 50–64 age group at 34% and 23% for 65 and older. Although reading reviews is popular, one-in-ten of Americans ==== share, and almost 50% ==== share reviews about product and services they used (Smith and Anderson, 2016).====The increasing presence of customer engagement in online fora provides a large amount of useful data for airline marketers and researchers. Effective analysis of these unstructured data can enable real-time customer feedback analysis, compared to traditional data analysing techniques (Liau and Tan, 2014). Although it is desirable for airlines to assess customer satisfaction, and to put forward remedial actions, it appears difficult to obtain genuine passenger feedback through traditional methods. The majority of customers are not always willing to share genuine feedback with their service provider, particularly feedback about their dissatisfaction (Berezina et al., 2016). Research shows that complaint behaviour of airline passengers varies based on demographic characteristics, and they voice their complaints either directly to the company or privately (WOM) or via a third party platform (Kim and Lee, 2009). It would be very useful for airlines to better understand their diverse customer base in order to take service improvement strategies since airlines are inherently multicultural businesses. The internet enables airlines to do this as customers share their experiences through various online platforms (Berezina et al., 2016). However, only a few studies in the airline sector have used online customer-generated content by conducting sentiment analysis of fora such as Twitter (Liau and Tan, 2014; Misopoulos et al., 2014) and Skytrax airline reviews (Siering et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018) to identify critical elements of airline services.====Online data are generally unstructured, and it is very difficult to analyse this large amount of data manually and objectively. However, this study uses a well-established statistical method, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) that reveals hidden meanings in unstructured data. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to analyse airline user-generated reviews to identify which service attributes lead to passenger satisfaction and dissatisfaction based on different airline business models and service class.====The main contribution of this study is to investigate TripAdvisor customer reviews of airlines through the use of a well-established text mining method (LSA). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous research has been undertaken using LSA technique, and TripAdvisor reviews in an airlines context. Furthermore, contrary to previous research, this study does not only consider passenger satisfaction attributes, but also takes into account customer dissatisfaction attributes and their importance rankings, by comparing airline business model and service class. This study also offers an alternative method to airlines to assess the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of their customers.====The paper is structured as follows; Section 2 Theoretical background, 3 Literature review explains theoretical background and relevant literature.

This is due to a number of objectives and constraints under which check-in groups are allocated to check-in counters.

However, planning operations exclusively focusing on noise impact may result in an increase of fuel consumption or delays. This paper develops a suitable bi-objective model for landing aircraft, which finds a schedule that minimises noise impact, total fuel consumption and delays, under wake vortex separation and Constrained Position Shifting restrictions. The results of this model are compared with real operations in a major European airport to assess the potential level of improvements. By comparing with real data from Madrid-Barajas airport, the research shows potential improvements of up to 4.5% reduction of total fuel consumption (without increasing noise levels) only by modifying the sequence of arrivals, and up to 43% (without extra fuel consumption) of reduction in noise impact over the populations under study.","By 2040, there will be a demand of 1.5 M flights than can be accommodated, i.e. 160 million passengers unable to fly (Eurocontrol, 2018). Even with 1.5 M flights unaccommodated and therefore lost, the network remains highly congested. Therefore, one of the central challenges facing the aviation industry is air traffic demand growth, which results in congestion in many airports, primarily hubs (Flores-Fillol, 2010). Managing take-offs and landings of any airport is a complex problem that plays an important role in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Runways and air controllers are limited resources, so air traffic needs to be planned carefully to limit peak demand and satisfy as many airlines’ requirements as possible (Artiouchine et al., 2008).====Building new airports and expanding the runway capacity of existing ones is one possible solution to congestion. However, this solution might result in negative environmental impacts on the quality of life of near-airport communities, such as noise disturbance, emissions, water pollution and habitat destruction (Laurenzo, 2006; Ho-Huu et al., 2017; Arntzen and Simons, 2014; Visser et al., 2008). In fact, several studies show a correlation between aircraft noise exposure and cardiovascular or psychological disease (Postorino and Mantecchini, 2016).====During recent years, the population has increased in the cities and residential areas have become closer to airports, which implies an increase in the number of people affected by undesirable noise (Ganic et al., 2015a). Aircraft noise is a major cause of community opposition to current operations and to airport capacity improvement, becoming a critical issue that affects the sustainability of future traffic growth. Noise produced by aircraft has two main sources (Prats et al., 2009): aeronautical noise, which is the consequence of the friction of the air along the aircraft, and engine noise.====During take-off, aircraft noise is mainly determined by the thrust of the engines required. Although take-off noise is significantly dominating noise issues around airports in terms of regulation and policies, due to engineer advances, higher noise reductions are expected at take-off operations, potentially increasing the importance of landing noise. Schäfer et al. (2019) found that lower fan pressure ratios and the absence of combustion noise leads to a 50% reduction in take-off noise. In contrast, during landing, the higher weight of all-electric aircraft will result in a 15% larger noise.====In an ideal world, an aircraft would take off, climb to its optimal cruising altitude, and maintain the cruising altitude if possible before beginning a constant, engines-idle descent until landing. In the real world, aircraft must coordinate with ATC which, when there are congestion delays, interrupts descents with level-offs and turns, forcing aircraft to spend more time at lower altitudes and deviate from their intended trajectory (Laurenzo, 2006). The initial schedule needs to be reorganised when planes are close enough to the airport, which means when they approach the TRACON – Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities – between 5 and 50 miles from the airport (Inniss and Ball, 2004). The combination of low altitude and frequent thrust transients leads to significant aerodynamic noise impact during the arrival phase of the flight (Coppenbarger, 2007), created when the landing gear is deployed because aircraft use lower thrust.====Aircraft noise impacts on the environment significantly for several reasons (Jagniatinskisa et al., 2016): living areas are close to airport locations; operations during night time; flight noise events repeating periodically; and, compared to other transportation means, aircraft have large noise levels over the background noise. At many noise-sensitive airports, quieter aircraft are the key to minimising the impact of aircraft noise and ensuring a sustainable growth of airport capacity and air transport under increasing environmental constraints, for the benefit of the travelling individuals, airlines and their neighbouring communities (Eurocontrol, 2018).====The control of noise around airports is a complex matter because many different factors have a significant impact on the creation and propagation of noise (Ganic et al., 2015b): fleet mix (types of aircraft that are using the airport); shape and characteristics of arrival and departure procedures; airport characteristics (number of take-offs and landings, the distribution of traffic throughout the day and night, etc.); and airport location. Aircraft vary in performance regarding noise and emissions. Even two aircraft of the same type may behave differently, depending on their weight and the atmospheric conditions.====The main approaches addressed today to reduce noise impact in the surrounding communities of airports, excluding impact on land use and/or carrying noise insulation methods, consider operational procedures and regulatory restrictions (Rodríguez-Díaz et al., 2017b). Regarding airport procedures, operations are designed to serve the vast majority of aircraft under a wide range of weather and wind conditions, thus reducing the choices of aircraft with better capabilities to achieve better performance (Hebly and Visser, 2011). Regarding regulatory restrictions, the concern from authorities is expressed in terms of different legislations and official restrictions that have been imposed in many countries (Directive, 2002/30/EC, 2002). Hence, minimising noise disturbance around airports is a task that needs the contribution of various stakeholders: institutions, aircraft manufacturers, airlines and air traffic control (ATC).====However, making the most efficient use of the current infrastructure by ATM would be the best alternative to balance demand with environmental restrictions. The challenge lies in simultaneously achieving safety, efficiency and equity, which are often competing objectives (Anagnostakis et al., 2001).====There are many factors that may oppose the objective of minimising noise (Christian and Sparrow, 2013): fuel burn, time-of-flight, emissions, etc. Hence, noise should not be the only parameter considered, as there are many stakeholders with various interests involved. Exclusively focusing on noise impact may result in an increase of fuel consumption (since avoiding noise impact on population located close to the airport may imply longer routes). To balance this conflict, the scope under research is to develop a suitable model for landing aircraft that finds a schedule that minimises noise impact, total fuel consumption and delays, while making the most of the current capacity of the runways.====Moreover, in this paper we aim to prove that there is a margin for improvement in terms of noise reduction and fuel consumption, just by deciding on the most appropriate landing runway and order in the landing sequence. Here we are not considering introducing any change in the Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STAR) of the considered airport since in the actual procedures there is still a place for considering noise impact and aiming for an efficient schedule. Our decision process starts in the approaching routes, and it is valid and applicable in general when the airport have more than one approach route, independently of the STARs involved.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the problem of the runway bottleneck and environmental concerns, and describes different approaches that have been studied in this field. In Section 3, the proposed linear model is presented, as well as the decision variables considered used to design the model. Also, as part of the methodology, the real scenario used for testing real operations is introduced, as well as the optimisation methodology. Section 4 presents a detailed example with a limited number of flight plans to show how the model works. In Section 5 the numerical results in the real environment of the Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas airport are described and analysed.

Our study addresses differences in ground operations. The organization of ground operations is seen as one distinguishing factor between airline business models. We investigate taxi-in, taxi-out, and turnaround times of aircraft and study the current status of the relation between airline ground times and airline business models. Our study rests on automatic dependent surveillance ==== (ADS-B) data to investigate ground times of aircraft. We identify that there currently remains a clear differentiation of airline ground times between the business models in spite of the business model convergence in the market.","In times of intense competition within the airline industry, optimized aircraft ground times have become an important factor in differentiating from competitors. These ground times include the core turnaround process, which Wu (2010, p. 64) defines as the time between the on-block and off-block time of the aircraft at a gate. Furthermore, aircraft ground times consider the taxi-in and the taxi-out process. In particular, low cost carriers (LCCs) focus on short ground times of their aircraft. For instance, Southwest Airlines reports turnaround times of only 15 min at certain airports (Wu, 2010, p. 23). Quick turnarounds and consequently short ground times serve as a competitive advantage to reach an optimal utilization of LCC fleets (Barrett, 2004). Aircraft stuck at a gate and not up in the air do not generate revenue. In addition, ground times have an impact on on-time departures. According to Eurocontrol (2017), 35.2% of the delays in the European aviation industry are due to operational delays during the turnaround process at the gate. Hence, efficiency of ground operations directly influences customer satisfaction and operational profitability.====The airline industry is characterized by a few business models, full service carriers (FSC) and LCC being two of them. Daft and Albers (2015) identify a general trend of convergence between these two business models in the markets. In a similar manner, Lohmann and Koo (2013) develop a continuum of business models, stressing the fact that FSC and LCC have started to develop towards each other. The resulting business model at the interface of FSC and LCC is referred to as a hybrid carrier (Corbo, 2017). When the two business models converge, strategic positions and operative procedures become more similar. Building on this observation we study the ground times of different airlines as these are core airline operations.====Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a key technology in the future of air traffic management. For instance, FAA transitions away from radar and towards ADS-B and requires all aircraft in most controlled airspace to be equipped with ADS-B technology by January 1, 2020 (FAA, 2018). AOPA (2019) comprehensively compiles the current status for various countries and regions on requiring aircraft to be equipped with ADS-B.====ADS-B is a surveillance technology: Aircraft broadcast relevant flight information, for example about the position, the ground speed, the flight number or the altitude (Sun et al., 2017). Fig. 1 illustrates a typical flight FlightAware ADS-B message. This information can be received on ground where it is nowadays an important resource for air traffic control. It can equally be received by other aircraft in flight and is used to avoid conflicts. In order to receive these messages on the ground, receiver antennas need to be in visual range of the aircraft, since the ADS-B signal is easily disrupted by mountains, buildings or other obstacles (Zhang and Wang, 2017). A space-based support to ADS-B has been tested and is currently ramping up: ADS-B signals are captured by satellites that relay the information to the ground. This will overcome current obstacles in terms of reception of ADS-B signals. With this support, ADS-B promises far more information than radar-based tracking of aircraft. However, the value of ADS-B information is bound to each aircraft actively sending out correct information.====A flight tracking provider such as FlightAware operates a worldwide network of ADS-B receivers to track aircraft. Currently, approximately 70% of the worldwide commercial passenger aircraft are equipped with ADS-B (FlightAware, 2018). Flightradar24 (2018) estimates that 80% of the commercial passenger aircraft in Europe are equipped with ADS-B transponders. For research purposes, ADS-B data offers great potential in tracking and analyzing aircraft movements independent of proprietary airline data as it provides reliability regarding the position of aircraft.====We make use of ADS-B data to observe aircraft ground movements and retrace aircraft ground times to build our analysis upon. Ground operations are one operational element that distinguishes airline business models. Given the convergence of business models in the market, it is our goal to investigate how far differences in aircraft ground times remain observable between airlines.====Our contribution lies in two aspects. One, we investigate the impact of airline business model on aircraft ground times finding that a difference persists regardless of the trend of airline business model convergence. Two, we present a novel data source to the transportation community by making use of ADS-B data for ground operations.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the background of airline ground operations. Section 3 presents the econometric model, by first introducing data sources, then explaining the variables that are developed and finally outlining the regression model.

This makes faster mode for transportation in India an inevitable necessity. Therefore, the role of air transportation becomes significant in connecting India due to its long-distance operations, unmatched speed, and time-saving characteristics. Evolution of Indian air transport industry date back, in December 1912, when the first International flight from India was started on London -Karachi - Delhi route. Moreover, a separate department of Civil Aviation was set up in April 1927 to look after all civil aviation matters in India. However, for long a time period, air transportation in India was limited to the elite class and ushered only after the entry of its first low-cost-carrier (LCC) ‘Air Deccan’ in the year 2003. With rising GDP per capita and low airfares, the Indian air transport industry's growth has seen an exceptional upswing in the last decade. The total passenger traveled increased from 73.4 million to 223.6 million in a decade (2006–2016). This growth also becomes evident as during the financial year 2016–2017 air passenger traffic (both domestic and international) in India witnessed a positive growth of 17.37 percent as compared to the previous year (Directorate General of Civil Aviation, 2017). These accomplishments became possible as the national fleet-size of scheduled Indian air carriers increased by 177% (162–448) and scheduled aircraft departures increased by 200% during 2003–2015. All these achievements have moved India to the 9th spot among the largest aviation markets in the world (Saranga and Nagpal, 2016). The various factors which have contributed to the growth of aviation market in India are a rise in average income per Indian, low fares offered by airlines, entry of new airlines, and the opening of new routes. Airbus and Boeing forecast 5% annual rise in global Revenue-Passenger Kilometers (RPK). This growth prediction will also be applicable to Indian context and India will need over 1100 aircraft (Airbus, 2007) along with around 400 airports across the nation (Jain and Natarajan, 2015) to exploit this opportunity.====Even with the above-stated accomplishments, Indian aviation industry is always confronted by continuous pressure due to a price-sensitive nature of passengers, vulnerable economic conditions (taxation, fuel price variability, etc.), and fierce competition (Saranga and Nagpal, 2016). All these factors resulted in financial losses to many airlines. The major Indian airlines are under a combined debt of about 13 billion dollars. Therefore, the Indian aviation industry which is often termed as “loss-making industry” needs to manage profits so as to remain competitive and sustainable in the future. The options available for these airlines to increase their profit are (a) to increase fare and extract as much from the passengers or (b) to reduce their expenses and make airline travel more attractive through additional amenities. Although for a long time, airlines shifted the burden of their financial liabilities and losses to the passengers by increasing the airfare, however liberalization and entry of low-cost-carriers limit the practice of this option. Therefore, the only option available with airlines is to maintain high operational efficiency by reducing their expenses (total operational cost). Airline total operational cost has many constituents but fuel cost with a share of about 35%–40% is a single largest item in total operational expense. Therefore, a significant reduction in airline operational expenses can be achieved by reducing its fuel expense, i.e. by lowering fuel consumption. In past decades, many airlines opted to be low-cost-carriers rather than conventional full-service carriers (FSC). This trend has shown fruitful results with the emergence of AirAsia (International) and Indigo (Indian) as best low-cost carriers==== Along with low-cost/no-frill strategies, these airlines are frontrunners in investing and acquiring fuel-efficient aircraft and implementing fuel conservation policies to lower their expenses and subsequently raising their profits. However, nowadays LCC's are transforming into hybrid air-carriers by integrating traits of both LCC and FSC (Klophaus et al., 2012).====All these scenarios and opportunities, designate Indian air transport sector as a vital and eligible area for our study. However, literature related to the Indian air transport industry and its facets are limited. The relation between operational cost (efficiency) and operating characteristics of airlines from different countries have been studied in numerous research articles (Brueckner and Abreu, 2017; Kwan and Rutherford, 2015; Lee et al., 2001; Proctor and Duncan, 1954; Ryerson and Hansen, 2013; Swan and Adler, 2006; Zuidberg, 2014). These studies either considered proxies for airline operational expense (fuel cost, cost per aircraft movement, efficiency or performance) or were focused on only a few factors. Furthermore, only a limited number of studies have considered airline cost as a dependent variable. A study by Proctor and Duncan (1954) is considered as an initial study investigating the influence of airline characteristics on airlines cost in the USA. The study concluded that load factor, capacity and aircraft utilization have a significant impact on airline cost. Further, in the year 1975, Särndal and Statton reported a correlation between average stage length and airline unit cost. However, Zuidberg (2014) demonstrated that density and load factor has a significant correlation with operating cost, but the effect of stage length appeared to be insignificant. In a recent study, Brueckner and Abreu (2017) investigated factors impacting airline fuel usage. Although this study does not seem to be directly related to airline operational cost, considering the share of fuel in airline operating cost its inferences are important to be reported. The study found aircraft size, stage length and lower aircraft age as significant contributors to reduce aviation fuel consumption. In the context of European airlines, Lozano and Gutiérrez (2011) demonstrated that investments for fleet improvement raise airlines operating cost. Also, a study by Assaf and Josiassen (2011) reported that an increase in fuel price has increased the total operating cost of many U.K. airlines. Only a few such studies (Jain and Natarajan, 2015; Saranaga and Nagpal, 2016; Sakthidharan and Sivaraman, 2018) in the context of Indian air transport industry are available. However, the focus of these studies was to achieve output in terms of revenue. Hence, in the face of the above-mentioned challenges and advancements, it is important to understand the developments in the operational expense of Indian airlines w.r.t. their fleet, flight operations, and operational strategies. This gap can be addressed by evolving the relationship between total operational cost and airline characteristics. The present paper focuses on the operational expense of an airline which differentiates it from previous studies. The econometric model containing these variables is developed from the conceptual framework. Hence, the outcomes of this study will provide answers to following questions in relation to the operational cost of Indian airlines i.e. how the operational cost of an airline is affected by payload? by stage length? by aircraft size? by aviation fuel price? and by the type ownership?====Airline operational performance related literature reveals application of different methods such as fuzzy (Chang and Shao, 2011), analytic hierarchy process (Berrittella et al., 2009), fuzzy-AHP (Mahtani and Garg, 2018), activity-based costing (Tsai and Kuo, 2004), structural equation modelling (Jenatabadi and Ismail, 2014), data envelopment analysis (Sakthidharan and Sivaraman, 2018; Saranga and Nagpal, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017), translog model (Zou and Hansen, 2012) and regression (Brueckner and Abreu, 2017; Hakim and Merkert, 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Zuidberg, 2014). Among all the above methodologies, regression analysis has been widely applied due to its wide range of applicability, easy estimation and relatively easy interpretations (Washington et al., 2011). Thus, this study applies regression analysis to estimate the impact of payload, stage length, aircraft size, fuel price, and ownership on the operational expense of Indian airlines, which would reveal the role of these variables to efficiently manage airline total operational cost. With this background, the study work for following research objectives-====This research paper is divided into four sections. Section 2 presents a conceptual framework & model development.

Rather than focusing on an airline-level analysis, we employ aggregated data from the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Airline Consumer Report (ACR) to explore four airline service performance metrics, namely: on-time performance, cancelled flights, mishandled baggage, and passenger's complaints. We gauge the long run effect of the variables of interest using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag bound approach. The findings reveal long-term linkages between airline service levels and the variation in interest rates and market concentration providing new evidence on the trade-off relation between financial pressures and service quality and has practical implications for both regulators and airline managers. Our results are robust to business cycle effects including the great recession.","Variations in economic conditions measured by the cost of borrowing and the pricing of important industrial commodities such as oil, as well as, in the market structure reflected by the consolidation of major players, have a direct or indirect effect on the financial performance of individual airlines, but also on the whole sector. After-effects of shocks on such critical cost factors may also affect the level of service quality offered to passengers leading to a degradation of service quality levels. The literature proposes several models (Dionne et al., 1997; Golbe, 1988; Maksimovic and Titman, 1991) which predict this relationship and postulate that a plausible strategy for firms to achieve their short-term goals is to trade-off the quality of their products. Moreover, the theory suggests that this association should be more apparent to financially weaker firms.====Another channel through which those factors may affect the airline service quality, is through their interlinked service supply chains (e.g., through code sharing, pooling of resources). Considering the efficiencies of pooling service supply chains in this sector, most airlines operate on a flight-only basis, outsourcing many critical activities to other organizations as service contracts. In that case, for a passenger flying from airport ==== to ==== with a particular airline, a web of different companies is going to be responsible for the check-in procedure, the ground handling services, the maintenance of the aircraft, and the crew. However, if one of these sub-contracted service providers experiences a service failure (e.g., a baggage loss), the airline is still liable towards the customer, and its performance record is affected. Taking into account the vast web of interconnected industries that are responsible for delivering the final service to the passenger, firm-specific characteristics may provide myopic information to operation managers (Choi et al., 2016). As such, it is natural to consider information coming from common risk factors for all firms.====In the context of civil aviation, empirical studies ignore systematic cost factors that may affect the whole sector. Being able to anticipate that kind of risk is a matter of particular economic significance to an airline's operational planner, given that such information can in many cases lead to firm-specific actions like hedging and debt restructuring (e.g., postponing new aircraft orders, cancelling new routes, extending option contracts for fuel supply, dropping one service provider for another). Considering all the above, our study evaluates the effects of systemic cost components on the operational performance of the US aviation industry by aggregating performance metrics, publicly available from the US Department of Transportation.====More specifically, our study aims to assess the impact of market conditions and economic factors on four widely used aspects of operation performance: (i) ====, (ii) ====, (iii) ==== and (iv) ====. Our study contributes to the existing literature by providing an understanding of how sector-wide airline service levels are affected by macro (or systematic) economic factors in three ways. First, our macroscopic analysis in the airline sector provides opportunities for a more extensive analysis than what can be performed at a firm-level. This means that summarizing company-specific data at industry-level would allow the universe of airlines to participate in our analysis without any loss of information, particularly for small airlines that often entail missing values in firm-specific controls. Second, by considering that the effects of macroeconomic factors in airline service performance may vary across the individual components of service quality outlined above, we utilize the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) introduced by Pesaran and Shin (1999). This allows model identification flexibility in the distribution of lag lengths by permitting a mixture of integration order for the explanatory variables for each aspect of operational performance. Third, we examine economic effects controlling for significant structural breaks in our test period including the 2008–2009 recession as well as upward trends in flight volume.====Our results reveal that base interest rate pressures and to some extent market concentration can explain variations in facets of operational quality across the aviation industry. We also find significant effects when we account for structural breaks and trends across the period of study, such as mergers and acquisitions during the great recession and general upward trends on airline passenger volume. Bearing in mind the impact of operational performance on the service offering of airlines to customers, operation managers should consider the long-run effects of these variables, especially in an environment where service contracts are highly interlinked. Our results are also of importance to policymakers such as those tasked with handling passenger complaints and civil aviation authorities that regulate minimum service provision levels from airlines to passengers. Considering that our study is focused on the US aviation market, a market highly criticized by passengers and regulators for its service performance in various levels, this study provides a timely and critical topic for debate for researchers and practitioners.====To this end, this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the related literature where the literature gap is explored and identified. Section 3 describes the data and variables used in the analysis presented in Section 4.

With data collected from 235 employees in the airline ","Surviving and realizing permanent competitive advantages are always an important organizational strategy for the airline industry. Service quality is usually the first priority to consider because it can improve many kinds of benefit outcomes, such as revisit intention (Liu and Lee, 2016), purchase intention (Escobar-Rodríguez and Carvajal-Trujillo, 2014), and loyalty and satisfaction (Hu et al., 2009). As is widely known, during the process of providing high-quality service, employees play an essential key role. However, how to motivate employees to put forth more effort in providing outstanding service quality is still a challenge for the airline industry.====Many studies in the literature have noted the crucial effect of job design and regarded that interpersonal relationships could make employees experience their tasks as being important and meaningful (Grant, 2007; Wrzesniewski et al., 2003). Moreover, the experience of important and meaningful tasks plays a key role in enhancing employees' resources and motivations at work (Adler and Kwon, 2000; Rangan, 2000). While the time is certainly ripe to explore the effect of job design, a proper application has not yet been incorporated into airline research. In fact, most studies only focused on the tangible antecedent, for example, corporate image affects service quality (Hussain et al., 2015), physical environment, and access quality (Wu and Cheng, 2013).====Grant (2007) suggested that no matter for the academic or practical perspective, research should place more attention on a rational job design, while at the same time it can also emphasize the important role of job architecture in employees' behaviors. Based on the job impact framework from Grant (2007), this study targets to understand how rational job design influences employees' feelings about their job content, and how these feelings transform into a psychological state of prosocial motivation, further resulting in high-level service quality. This study is designed to make contributions to theory and research on human resources, transportation management, and the airline industry in the following ways. First, based on the self-determination theory (SDT) and previous research, this study develops an integrated model to simultaneously examine the relationship among perceived social impact, beneficiary contact, prosocial motivation, and service quality. Second, this research tests the moderating effect of beneficiary contact on the relationship between perceived social impact and prosocial motivation. In addition, this model incorporates prosocial motivation to test its mediating role and fixes the deficiency of motivation viewpoint on service quality.====This research expects when employees have more opportunities to perceive social impact that this will inspire their inner desire for improving other people's lives, such as thoughts, feelings, and welfare of other people, and further enhance the high quality of service. Through an effective job design to contact customers, it not only reinforces the effect of perceived social impact on prosocial motivation but also is beneficial for the important competitive advantage of “service quality” in the airline industry. Both researchers and practitioners can utilize this study's understanding of how relational job design fosters employees' motivation to better customers' lives and purchase experience.

The results reveal that tourism numbers increased sharply as more alternative choices emerged to visitors after the entrance of low-cost carriers due to airline liberalization. Moreover, different airline types attract different kinds of visitors, contributing to tourism diversification. In particular, low-cost airline tourists are younger than those who travel in full-service airlines or charter flights. They are also more likely to buy a last-minute ticket and to come from Iberian and French markets. Charter flights, however, are important choices for those traveling to the Azores from more distant markets such as Sweden and Denmark.","Tourism is a worldwide growing industry, and operators and destinations compete fiercely in order to attract visitors. Furthermore, air transport is a key component of tourism growth. As stated by Bieger and Wittmer (2006), air transport and tourism are interlinked, and a clear and suitable airline policy is necessary to strategic development of destinations. This view is naturally reinforced for destinations whose main mode of access is the aircraft.====The airline industry has experienced profound changes in the last decades due to deregulation, resulting in intense competition among carriers. Three different airline business models can be clearly identified and differentiated by the services offered to travelers and their operational characteristics (Lordan, 2014; Cento, 2009). These are low-cost airlines (also known as no-frills, discount, or budget airlines), full-service airlines (or legacy airlines) for scheduled flights, and charter flights. Low-cost airlines have emerged in the wake of deregulation, and they compete in many touristic destinations with the full-service airlines (O'Connell and Williams, 2005; Francis et al., 2006; Forgas et al., 2010; Chiou and Chen, 2010; Graham and Dennis, 2010) and charter carriers (Williams, 2001, 2011; Buck and Lei, 2004; Lordan, 2014; Rodríguez and O'Connell, 2017).====Airline liberalization usually expands the number of alternatives available to passengers. In principle, customers make choices in order to maximize their utility subject to a set of constraints, and such a choice may depend on a set of attributes or profiles. Therefore, from the airlines’ point of view, it is very important to identify the needs of passengers to provide air services that meet their preferences. In such a setting, airlines try to explore and implement targeted and customized marketing strategies to attract travelers with different socioeconomic and trip characteristics. According to Gilbert and Wong (2003), many airline companies are in search of service segmentation strategies that will satisfy different target market segments.====Several studies have shown that airline liberalization and the entrance of low-cost airlines have contributed positively to tourism growth in some destinations (Donzelli, 2010; Graham and Dennis, 2010; Rey et al., 2011; Chung and Whang, 2011; Dobruszkes and Mondou, 2013; Fageda et al., 2017; Tsui, 2017).====Furthermore, a few studies have addressed the problem of travelers' airline choice (O'Connell and Williams, 2005; Oyewole et al., 2007; Fourie and Lubbe, 2006; Ong and Tan, 2010; Chiou and Chen, 2010; Forgas et al., 2010; Castillo-Manzano and Marchena-Gómez, 2011; Ukpere et al., 2012). These works have focused on the factors that influence airline choice decision making, such as passengers' socio-demographic attributes and the characteristics of the journey, among others. However, they have mostly addressed travelers in general instead of the choice made by visitors of a touristic destination. Moreover, the empirical analysis has focused on profiling low-cost and full-service airline passengers. Charter flights, which are very important to some tourist destinations, have been mostly excluded from the analysis.====This study intends to contribute to the literature by examining the case of the Azores Islands, where air transport policy has recently witnessed profound changes through a liberalization process that allowed the entry of low-cost airlines in the domestic corridors. These airlines had been previously highly regulated and attributed to two full-service carriers, but the change in regulation has increased competition and diversification of the services and alternatives available for travelers’ choices. The paper addresses the effect of airline choice on tourism growth. For this purpose, we consider three airline business alternative choices: full-service airlines, low-cost airlines, and charter flights. This exercise is also important to assess whether low-cost carriers attract a different kind of visitor, contributing to the diversification of the touristic demand, or merely facilitate access to the destination.",Airline choice and tourism growth in the Azores,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718302849,7 March 2019,2019,Research Article,482.0

Additionally, today's high safety standards must not be negatively influenced by the introduction of free route airspaces. In this paper, we present a trajectory calculation model capable of exploiting a 4D free route optimization potential while considering the divergent targets of safety, efficiency and environmental compatibility. In particular, the environmental effects of condensation trails depending on the time of the day are carefully considered. To further estimate the impact of free routes on airspace demand and on safety issues, the model is implemented in the simulation environment TOMATO, and the European flight intentions have been optimized for an entire day based on departure airports, arrival airports and original departure times July 2016. The resulting trajectories are evaluated against the number, location and duration of separation infringements. Despite constantly changing air speeds and cruising altitudes induced by the optimization target functions, the number and duration of separation infringements could be reduced by 30% due to optimized lateral and vertical trajectories. The results of this case study show a high potential for an increased airspace capacity under free routing conditions. Furthermore, fuel burn (20%) and airline direct operational costs (40%) could be significantly reduced.","Today's air traffic system is facing three conflicting performance areas as set out by the relevant worldwide research programs NextGen (Federal Aviation Administration, 2016) and SESAR (SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2015). These are safety, efficiency and environmental compatibility. For the en-route phase, safety is mainly set by minimum separation requirements which impact the existing scarce airspace capacity. Efficiency is set and measured by a variety of metrics, such as airport capacity utilization and great circle deviation. From the economic side, air navigation costs per flight depending on flight time and fuel burn (SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2015) put stress on airlines to achieve high efficiency levels. Considering instruments like the European Emission Trading System (ETS) the environmental impact of aviation is already being assessed on the basis of aircraft engine emissions. Additionally, condensation trails (contrails) with a significant influence on the radiation budget of the Earth's atmosphere (i.e., radiative forcing, RF) (Sausen et al., 2005; Myhre et al., 2013) will also need to be considered in the future (Rosenow, 2016). Contrails form in the presence of ice-supersaturated regions (Sussmann and Gierens, 2001), which are dynamic layers in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. To avoid contrail formation, aircraft would need to bypass these ice-supersaturated regions either laterally or vertically (Sussmann and Gierens, 2001), hampering flight efficiency since detours cause extra fuel burn (Rosenow et al., 2016a) and since different overfly charges may accumulate. Today differences in overfly charges and in air navigation charges already lead to detours during a lateral trajectory optimization when airlines attempt to avoid expensive upper airspaces such as Switzerland (compare Fig. 3). Thus, highly competing objective functions impact the performance indicators of a trajectory (Rosenow et al., 2016a). Additionally, a trajectory optimization might lead to unsolvable, high requirements on airspace capacity because similar vertical and lateral trajectories with non-constant air speeds are expected and since airlines will still prefer wind-optimized flight paths which do not significantly differ between the commonly used Aircraft types.====To find such multi-criteria optimum flight paths, which satisfy airline's efficiency intensions as well as Air Traffic Management (ATM) constraints, both highly accurate single aircraft trajectories and air traffic flow prediction are required. Until now, these aspects have been treated separately either on the flight planning level or for Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) purposes initiated by different stakeholders. Generally, aircraft type specific 2.5D performance tables by BADA (EUROCONTROL) are used and include coarse approximations regarding the trajectory calculation and assessment (Rosenow et al., 2016a; Förster et al., 2016). The TOolchain for Multi-criteria Aircraft Trajectory Optimization TOMATO has been developed to precisely solve this catenation. TOMATO is an air traffic simulation environment based on an accurate trajectory optimization which includes the estimation of engine emissions and provides a trajectory and ATFM assessment (compare Table 2). In the present case study, the air traffic flow scheme and a historic European EUROCONTROL flight plan set were used for optimization trials. For comparison and assessment, these trials were split into three scenarios:====In this case study, the trajectories are analyzed with respect to number, location and duration of separation infringements mainly induced by non-constant air speeds and altitudes. Therewith, the influence of optimized free routes on airline and network efficiency can be approximated. In the first studies with TOMATO, only the number of aircraft within a defined spatial grid had been analyzed, which merely allowed statements about imminent separation infringements, the airspace capacity, controllers’ workload (Rosenow et al., 2017a) and typical patterns of airways caused by different optimization strategies (Rosenow et al., 2017b). Now for the first time, an extensive post analysis of each individual trajectory allows for the estimation of actual separation infringements.====Several air traffic flow simulation environments have been developed, each with a specific scope. On the one hand, the fast-time air traffic simulator AirTOp (Online. Available: http:a) generates trajectories in a dynamic airspace structure and iteratively considers conflict detection and conflict resolution (Luchkova et al., 2015). AirTOp has been applied for rerouting around volcanic ash clouds (Luchkova et al., 2016) and for estimating the influence of restricted airspaces on the air traffic system (Kreuz et al., 2016). However, due to approximations in the aircraft performance modeling (which is limited to BADA performance tables) and restrictions regarding the quantification of the emissions (due to missing information of the conditions within the engine combustion chamber), AirTOp does not consider precise trajectory optimization. The Test bench for Agent-Based Air Traffic Simulation (TABATS) has been developed for the trajectory synchronization of highly predictable arrivals enabled by full automation and focuses on the simulation of trajectory scenarios under realistic weather conditions (i.e., lateral rerouting around thunder cells and speed adjustments) with a specialized airport slot allocation routine (Schultz et al., 2011, 2012, 2013; Kaiser et al., 2012). However, TABATS also concentrates on BADA performance tables and is limited in the quantification of the emissions.====Grewe et al. (2016) concentrate on the climate assessment of trajectories considering future aircraft technologies and uncertainties in the quantification of emissions. Grewe et al. do not focus on the impact of optimized trajectories on ATFM. In the framework of the research project ATM4E, Matthes et al. (2016) have developed a multi-dimensional optimization tool for trajectories and their impact on the air traffic network and demand. This intention covers parts of the study presented in this paper. Regarding the flight performance modeling, the commercial flight planning tool Lido/Flight 4D, developed by Lufthansa Systems (Online. Available: https), is also able to simulate trajectories assuming an International Standard Atmosphere ISA without wind information. Hence, special weather phenomena, like ice-supersaturated regions cannot be modeled. The Airspace Simulator TAAM, developed by Jeppesen, is also able to simulate air traffic flows in ISA. Anyhow, the impact of adverse weather conditions is already parameterized.====Considering single trajectory optimization, most approaches focus on cruise phase only (Grabbe et al., 2006; Ng et al., 2011, 2014; Sridhar et al., 2013; Sridhar and Chen, 2010; Zillies et al., 2013), utilizing the BADA performance model (Ng et al., 2011, 2014; Serafino, 2015) or neglecting a realistic flight performance. Thereby, speed and altitude are assumed as constant and defined as static parameters. Ng et al. and Serafino use the optimum control approach for vertical trajectory optimization and reduce the modeling of the flight performance to a manageable number of parameters (Ng et al., 2011, 2014; Serafino, 2015), whereas Grabbe et al. and Sridhar concentrate on the lateral path optimization (Grabbe et al., 2006; Sridhar et al., 2013; Sridhar and Chen, 2010; Zillies et al., 2013). Table 1 summarizes the literature review by the most important categories and indicates the complexity of aircraft trajectory optimization and capacity analyses which is applied in TOMATO for the first time.====TOMATO is in no way restricted to the type of target function in the multi-criteria optimization procedure as long as aircraft type-specific flight performance envelopes are not exceeded. Where freely planned trajectories without Air Traffic Service (ATS) route constraints are burdened with time stamps for an efficient Air Traffic Flow Management, TOMATO can be perfectly used for the simulation of Performance Based Navigation (PBN) procedures. Therefore, free routes are simulated with TOMATO unless a navaid infrastructure is restricting the solution space of the path finding algorithm. Free routes are freely planned routes between a defined entry point and a defined exit point of a so-called Free Route Airspace (FRA) or a Flight Information Region (FIR). Free routes are described by published or unpublished waypoints (position data) (Eurocontrol, 2012). In many European air traffic control sectors, FRA has already been implemented, at least at night (O'Keeffe and Houlihan, 2015; Eurocontrol, 2017). Free routes significantly differ from directs (great circle navigation) between defined entry points and exit points because they may fully utilize actual wind speed and wind direction and overfly charges. However, for this precise optimization, accurate and up-to-date weather information is required, which is not (often) utilized in today's operations. For that reason, aircraft mostly follow orthodromes to ensure the shortest air distance. For safety reasons, those directs are only allowed in the upper airspace (above 250 hPa).====The fuel saving potential of a full implementation of orthodromes in the European upper airspace has been quantified between 4====5 10==== tons (Agency, 2016) and 5 10==== tons per year (Bucuroiu, 2017). The EASA consider a proportion of flight time flown in Free Route Airspace at 8.5% (Agency, 2016). Other studies specify the fuel saving potential of directs in the upper airspace of smaller regions, such as six tons per day in the Czech Republic (Kraus, 2011) (corresponding to roughly 2 10==== tons per year) or 3====7 10==== tons per year in the Maastricht Upper Air Control Center (Lebutte and Roman, 2017). This promising saving potential will increase significantly if actual weather information is considered in the design of free routes along the fuel minimum flight path during the whole flight, allowing for optimum climb and descent profiles. In TOMATO, a perfect weather data provision and a free route concept in all airspaces are assumed in the multi-criteria trajectory optimization. From this follow large differences in fuel burn, time of flight and distance flown between the reference scenario and the optimized situation.","Impact of multi-criteria optimized trajectories on European airline efficiency, safety and airspace demand",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719300043,26 February 2019,2019,Research Article,483.0

As competition in the airline industry increases, providing high quality services and value creation have become all the more necessary (Chen et al., 2011). Today, value creation relies mostly on intellectual capital that cannot be recognized in financial statements under the current accounting standards or financial reporting framework (Gokten and Gokten, 2017; Atalay et al., 2018). A main component of the intellectual capital is relational capital that refers to customer loyalty and satisfaction. Relational capital increases profitability by enhancing service quality and customer satisfaction. As Liou et al. (2011) points out, there is no universally agreed definition of service quality. Service quality is a context-dependent construct that can be evaluated through various aspects for various industries. Conventional opinion holds that customer satisfaction increases as perceived service quality increases. However, recent studies indicate the existence of a non-linear pattern between the dimensions of service quality and customer satisfaction (Basfirinci and Mitra, 2015). For this reason, it is necessary to identify the relative importance of service quality dimensions.====An airline operator is expected to satisfy the passengers on each attribute if it wishes to be the preferred operator (Li et al., 2017; Medina-Muñoz et al., 2018). Studies show that customer expectations and perceptions of airline services have not fully been understood (Chow, 2015; Waguespack and Rhoades, 2008). Besides, many airline operators fail to correctly allocate their resources (Curtis et al., 2012). Market shares of airline operators are driven by customer perceptions of service quality (Zhu, 2016). Passengers make their airline choices based on service quality, and rank airline operators accordingly (Prayag, 2007; Wen and Yeh, 2010). Learning customer expectations and needs is a critical factor to ensure sustainability in the airline industry (Chen and Chang, 2005; Tsafarakis et al., 2018; Zhu, 2016). It is necessary for airline operators to prioritize service characteristics that have greater impact on important customer expectations and needs, and accordingly manage their resources so as to appropriately meet customer expectations (Liou et al., 2011; Chow, 2015). Global financial environment demands targeted and well-projected resource management (Tsafarakis et al., 2018).====This study proposes a new hybrid method to identify highest priorities for airline passengers and accordingly optimize resource allocation, combining the Importance-Performance-Impact Analysis (IPIA) method introduced by Lin and Vlachos (2018), fuzzy logic and information entropy. The IPIA method aims to identify the most critical attributes for customers using importance, performance and impact dimensions and to propose efficient and effective resource allocation for managers. It attempts to overcome the shortcomings of the Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) method (Martilla and James, 1977) by enhancing the reliability and usefulness of resource allocation decisions for managers with the addition of impact dimension (Lin and Vlachos, 2018). Thus, it is to date study that provides airline managers with information on customer expectations, level of fulfillment of these expectations and impact of these expectations on the resource capacity and allocation of airline operators. In the new hybrid approach proposed in this study, fuzzy logic is used to reduce the uncertainty created by the fuzzy nature of subjective human perceptions. The fuzzy set theory is appropriate to evaluate service quality (Benitez et al., 2007; Chon et al., 2008; Tsaur et al., 2002; Wang, 2004). This study also introduces information entropy to the analysis in an attempt to remove decision-maker bias. Consequently, the new hybrid model enhances the reliability and usefulness of resource allocation decisions by taking the impact dimension into account, reduces uncertainty, considers the fuzzy nature of subjective human perceptions through fuzzy logic, and removes decision-maker bias. There are a few studies in the literature discussing the Fuzzy Importance-Performance Analysis (FIPA) method and one discussing the IPIA method. This is the first ever study that combines information entropy and the Fuzzy Importance-Performance-Impact Analysis (FIPIA) method into a hybrid approach.====In the following sections, the concept, dimensions and attributes of airline service quality are discussed. Then, IPA and IPIA methods are outlined, followed by an introduction to fuzzy logic and information entropy to build the proposed hybrid method. Then, a field study is presented which has employed the proposed hybrid model to identify air passengers’ perceptions on dimensions and attributes of airline service quality, and analyze responses to produce recommendations to airline managers for better resource allocation. The final section consists of a discussion of the findings, conclusions, limitations of this present study and suggestions for further research.",FIPIA with information entropy: A new hybrid method to assess airline service quality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303235,May 2019,2019,Research Article,484.0

With this aim, a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) is applied, estimating with a one-step procedure technical efficiency and the effect of airlines' market power on that efficiency. Results suggest that when airports are lowly concentrated increasing concentration reduces such inefficiencies. However, this effect practically disappears when airports are highly concentrated. Additionally, the government's policies to improve airports' performance seems to have a positive effect in the short run.","Airport activities are characterized by the vertical structure of their market in which infrastructure providers and carriers are separated. In this way, airport supplies services directly to final consumers (cargo and passengers terminals) and indirectly providing airlines inputs such as terminals, runaways or storage areas (Ha et al., 2013). This vertical structure implies the linkage between both upstream market (airport facilities) and downstream market, meaning that what happens in one of them likely has effects on the other one. In this line, we want to study if the structure of the downstream market (airline market) could affect the performance of its infrastructure provider (the airport).====In literature, it is possible to find several studies that analyze the effects of airline market concentration. These works mainly focus on the impact of airline market structure on airlines' prices and quality (flight delays). With respect to the relationship between airlines' concentration and the fares that they charge, Brueckner et al. (2013), Boresnstein (1990), Evans and Kessides (1993) and Graham et al. (1983) find that the higher airline concentration in a given airport, the higher fees that they charge. In a similar line, Borenstein and Rose (1994), Gaggero and Piga (2011), Giaume and Guillou (2004) and Stavins (2001) find a negative relationship between market concentration and price dispersion, so a concentrated airline market reduce price discrimination among consumers. In contrast, the results obtained by Gerardi and Saphiro (2009) show that airline competition increases price dispersion. On the other hand, Cao et al. (2017), Greenfield (2014) and Mazzeo (2003) revise the topic of the effect of airline concentration on flight delays. They find a negative effect of concentration on airlines' on-time performance.====However, to the best of our knowledge, only Ha et al. (2013) analyze the effect of the concentration in the airline market (downstream market) on airport efficiency (upstream market)====.==== This paper aims to contribute to the analysis of the relationship between airline market concentration and airport infrastructure efficiency. To do this, we estimate a stochastic frontier function to a sample of 41 Spanish airports that allows jointly estimating in a one-step procedure the airport technical efficiency and the effect of airline market concentration on such efficiency.====The relationship between airline concentration and airport efficiency seems to be complex, so it is possible to find in literature justifications for both a positive and a negative correlation between them. Ha et al. (2013) enumerate arguments both for and against concentration based on a simple theoretical model. First, authors show that if congestion exists and there are not other alternative modes, when airlines have some market power a double marginalization problem appears. Therefore, passengers have to pay more than under perfect competition market structure. This reduces demand for airports services, arising over-invest problems, and so, inefficiencies. However, the above mentioned double marginalization problem could be total or partially solved by a long-term collaboration between airlines and airports. This collaboration is easier to reach when airports render their services to a reduced number of airlines than if many small airlines are using the same infrastructure (Basso, 2008). Second, their model also shows that the higher market share of an airline operator, the more incentives to reduce congestion, which could improve airport efficiency.====Other arguments that explain a positive relation between airline concentration and airports' efficiency could be the following ones. First, a high concentration in the downstream market could favor better coordination between airlines and airports, allowing airlines to be involved in the decision-making of the facility. This kind of coordination or collaboration could improve input allocation and reduce passenger traffic uncertainty. Second, Fu et al. (2011) point out long-term contracts between airports and their dominant airline guarantee airlines' services for a long period reducing airports' uncertainty about their future revenues. Finally, Cachon and Lariviere (2005) state that vertical cooperation could improve efficiency, as we stated above, this cooperation is less complicated with a few airlines with high market shares.====The structure of the paper is the following one. In Section 2, the Spanish airport system is briefly described. In Section 3, the methodology applied and the econometric specification are displayed. In section 4, data sources and variables' definition are explained.

The purpose of this paper is to present a model for air travelers’ mode choice behaviors under the assumption that RPAs are introduced to the market. Results show that the fare of RPA should be lowered by a certain amount (i.e., discount factor of RPA) to compete with CPA, and the discount factor should be higher for older, female, and frequent travelers. The results also show that there are still concerns about RPA, and pilot on board is preferred. Through this study, it will be possible to predict the acceptance of newly introduced technology in consideration of socio-demographic characteristics of potential customers.","With significantly improved technologies in the area of flight operation and communications, interest in the operation of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) has grown in the private sector. Recently, NASA succeeded in the first RPA mission in the national airspace system without a chaser, which had previously flown along with the RPA for safety (NASA, 2018). It is expected that RPAs will be used for firefight, search and rescue, border patrol, and other applications. However, there is a lack of international standards for the certification, operations, air traffic control, and essential technologies such as ==== and ====. To create such standards, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established the Remotely Piloted Aircraft System Panel in 2014 and has sense then amended relevant regulations, such as ICAO Annexes, in order to accommodate the operations of RPA in international airspace. RPAs that are currently under discussion in the ICAO are limited to those for international flights following instrumental flight rules. At the early stage, RPAs will be utilized for cargo due to their relatively lower risk of casualties, and are expected to be applied to passenger aircraft once the safety and relevant technologies are assured.====This study aims to investigate air travelers’ mode choice behaviors, estimate the rate of substitution between transport modes (conventionally piloted aircraft (CPA) and RPA), and analyze its meaning under the assumption that RPAs are introduced to the air transport industry, which has been dominated by CPA.====To accomplish this, a stated preference survey of air travelers was performed using fare and travel time, two of the most important variables among various considerations in choosing flights, and their mode choices were estimated using a discrete choice model. The model was disaggregated by gender, age, and travel frequency to analyze the impacts of those factors on the choice of RPA. This is the first study to analyze mode choice behavior for RPA by socio-demographic characteristics such as gender and age, which are expected to affect the mode choice. Also, a comparison between a direct flight and an indirect flight in terms of flight time is given, such as a low-price and indirect flight by RPA versus a high-price and direct flight by CPA.====Once RPAs are operated in earnest in the future, the results of this study will contribute to predicting how air travelers’ mode choice behaviors will change depending on whether the pilot is on board or not under the same operational conditions. In addition, the results can be utilized as basic data by airlines in preparing and establishing strategies for the operation of RPAs. Ultimately, the finding of this study, which is the capability of the choice behavior modeling, will help efficiently operating fleets of airlines who will introduce RPAs for passenger transport in the future. For instance, airlines may try to improve their price competitiveness by operating RPAs for indirect flights.",Mode choice behavior analysis of air transport on the introduction of remotely piloted passenger aircraft,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303181,May 2019,2019,Research Article,486.0

Accordingly, the purposes of this study are to identify four types of the consumer citizenship behavior, including advocacy, feedback, helping and tolerance, and to examine two direct and indirect determinants of it. Then, a moderating effect of the air passenger-related factor (domestic vs. international trips) has been assessed on the proposed relationships. The results of this paper suggest decomposing two dimensions of service quality (intangible and tangible resources of airline services) which indirectly affect the consumer citizenship behavior via perceived value. Those passengers who took domestic trips are more likely to have the stronger relationships than travelers who carried out international trips.","The air transport sector plays an important role as one of the major contributors to the South Korean economy. With regard to employment, airlines, airport operators, airport on-site enterprises (including restaurants and retail), aircraft manufacturers, and air navigation service providers employed 130,000 people in South Korea in 2014 (Oxford Economics, 2016). The report developed by Oxford Economics (2016) presented that the air transport industry has generated $44 billion worth of gross value-added contributions to the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014, which indicates 3.1% of GDP in South Korea. Looking at the evaluations of international visitors who used air transportation in South Korea, it is found that while cost competitiveness is high, the infrastructure quality score appears with 4 out of 7 points (Oxford Economics, 2016). Importantly, the statistics indicate the necessity of research to enhance the service quality of the airline sector in South Korea, in particular.====Reviewing extant literature, there are a number studies assessing the service quality, predominantly by applying a framework of the Service Quality model (SERVQUAL) (Gilbert & Wong, 2003; Nel, Pitt, & Berthon, 1997). Most of them have estimated the relationship of the service quality with satisfaction (Ali et al., 2015), customer loyalty (Ostrowski et al., 1993), and behavioral intention to reuse the airline services (Park et al., 2004). When considering a notion of airline services, such as experiential products, this study argues the importance of decomposing aspects between tangible and intangible resources (Allee, 2008; Wakefield and Blodgett, 1999). The intangibility of airline service makes it difficult for customers to assess the service quality; thus, there is an increased sense of risk and uncertainty toward services before their consumption. In addition, several marketing researchers have emphasized the tangible cues in the service environment, which interact with intangible cues and ultimately help people judge the service quality (Koernig, 2003). For instance, consumers would examine the extent to which airplane interiors are well decorated and whether airline staff are dressed in uniforms properly. Thus, it can be argued that assessing two separate aspects (i.e., intangible and tangible resources) of service quality and understanding different effects on consumer evaluations on the airline services are crucial issues.====With the emergence of service-dominant (S-D) logic, as a new marketing paradigm, the value creation has been emphasized as reflecting consumer outcomes (Vargo and Lusch, 2004). Along with a statement that the service is a process, benefits of exchange rather than the units of output. S-D logic stresses the value co-creation that is coordinated through shared institutions (e.g., between consumers and a company or between consumers and consumers) (Vargo and Lusch, 2008). Co-creation of value refers to transmitting the customer's collaborative role in value creation (i.e., value-in-use). Rather than a merely function of firms delivering value propositions, the co-production of the core offering through co-design, joint production, and collaborative originality has becomes a key component of value co-creation (Lusch and Vargo, 2006). In general, there are two types of customer value co-creation behavior including customer participation behavior referring to obligatory behavior required for successful value co-creation. Yet, this current study investigates customer citizenship behavior reflecting voluntary behavior that offer supportive value to the form, which is not inevitably required for the success of value co-creation (Yi and Gong, 2013).====The customer citizenship behaviors are discretionary and pro-social actions exhibited by customers, which benefit both the service provider (i.e., the airline company in this study) and other customers (e.g., airline passengers) (Balaji, 2014; Bove et al., 2009; Garma and Bove, 2011). Indeed, the presence of customer citizenship behaviors improves not only customer affect, satisfaction, loyalty, and brand equity (Burmann et al., 2009), but also performance (Sun et al., 2007). Importantly, however, the attempts to understand customer citizenship behaviors are largely paucity in the airline context.====Thus, this study has three research purposes: (1) to assess the heterogeneous influences of intangible and tangible resources in airline services on perceived value comprising multidimensional constructs; (2) to evaluate the relationship between perceived value and customer citizenship behaviors, including four types of proactive behaviors (i.e., advocacy, feedback, helping, and tolerance); (3) to test the mediating effect of perceived value on the relationship between intangible or tangible resources and the citizenship behaviors; (4) to assess the moderating effect of an air passenger-related factor (domestic vs. international trips) on the proposed relationships.",Assessing customer citizenship behaviors in the airline industry: Investigation of service quality and value,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969971830303X,May 2019,2019,Research Article,487.0

Cost has to be reduced and efficiency has to be increased constantly. At the same time, customer satisfaction needs to be increased. Otherwise, the airline in question would face loss of market share. One area of improvement is the ==== boarding process, which has been subject to many simulation-based research projects resulting in significant reduction of boarding time. However, those models neglected the customer's wishes regarding sitting or boarding in groups. Using a simulation approach, this paper presents a model for a reduction of boarding time with consideration of customers' expectations. The achieved boarding times are found to be higher than previously reported minimum times, but show a boarding time reduction in comparison with conventional boarding strategies.","The airplane turnaround time (‘turn time’) is defined as the period of time from landing the airplane until taking off for the next flight. In addition to other contributors such as deboarding, cleaning, refueling, etc., which may partially occur simultaneously, a significant fraction of the turnaround time is consumed by the boarding process, i.e. the period of time beginning with the first passenger entering the airplane and ending with all passengers sitting in their assigned seats (overall boarding time) (Van Landeghem and Beuselinck, 2002). Due to the fact that the turnaround time is a cost factor in a highly competitive industry, the boarding process has been subject to research based on simulation as well as practical experiments.====In addition to a cost factor of roughly $30 for each minute on the floor (Nyquist and McFadden, 2008), a well controlled and short boarding time stabilizes the flight schedule, particularly in case of a high number of comparably short flights per day. The boarding process time is influenced by factors like boarding pattern, amount of luggage, distribution of luggage and walking speed. Many investigations have focused on the boarding pattern and shown a significant improvement of overall boarding time when using specific ways of boarding, compared to the conventional random boarding pattern or the back-to-front (BF) boarding approach (Steffen, 2008). In addition to simulations and in order to support the simulation results, the passengers’ real behaviour has been subject to laboratory investigations (Gwynne, 2018; M. Schultz, 2018).====Unfortunately, the theoretically fastest way to board an airplane might not be accepted by the passengers for psychological reasons (Steffen, 2008), which is probably why most of the airlines adhere to a random or slightly adjusted boarding pattern. This may also be the reason for investigating the passengers' perceived boarding time (Miura and Nishinari, 2017; Ren and Xu, 2018). In addition to the boarding pattern, approaches to improving the boarding time include, for instance, seat number allocations being given to passengers when they pass the boarding gate (Notomista et al., 2016), seat assignments based on the passengers’ carry-on luggage (Milne and Salari, 2016) and infrastructural changes, such as providing a wide aisle by using Side-Slip-Seats (Schultz, 2017).====Several investigations also include the passengers' desire to board and sit in groups. Here, group behaviour is identified as a factor for increasing boarding efficiency (Tang et al., 2018) or, in the other case, a proposal is made for a passenger sequencing process, which goes through the list of passengers and arranges them in a queue for boarding. However, with this approach, additional operational efforts and passengers’ discipline are required to achieve shorter boarding times (Zeineddine, 2017).====With the intention to provide boarding patterns that are both time-efficient and accepted by the passengers, in this article a simple simulation model is presented that includes various boarding patterns, various amounts and distributions of luggage, groups of passengers and a walking speed distribution. In the first part, simulation results are compared with literature results, and minor changes of airline policies are applied to existing boarding policies in order to gain some guidelines for improvement. The simulation uses the Boeing 737–800 seating layout with 31 rows and 3 seats on each side of an aisle. The row-to-row distance is roughly 16 inches. The distance between the airplane entrance and the first row is assumed to correspond to approximately 4 rows’ walking distance. The model does not consider priority boarding and assumes a completely booked airplane.====In the second part, using a simulated annealing approach (Merz, 2015), general rules for boarding pattern optimization are determined, which are used to propose new boarding patterns which allow the passengers to board in four major groups and at least some of them to sit together in groups of three people (‘triple passengers’). The following text focusses on ‘triple passengers’ as an example. Major groups with four or five passengers were not investigated.====The proposed boarding patterns are compared with known patterns regarding overall boarding time and individual boarding time, depending on the bin occupancy level. Boarding in four groups was chosen because this concept is well known amongst the passengers.====The purpose of this work is to identify boarding patterns that are competitive or even better than existing patterns in overall boarding time, but that will increase customer satisfaction at the same time.",Customer-oriented optimization of the airplane boarding process,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699715300727,May 2019,2019,Research Article,488.0

The purpose of this study is to identify and examine the factors that contribute to navigation errors in the NAT Region by integrating a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) into the Human Factors Analysis and Classifying System (HFACS) framework for the first time to the best of our knowledge. According to the priority weights, the most important factors contributing to oceanic errors are lack of training provided by airlines, use of inappropriate routes for oceanic crossing by dispatchers, and failure to take preventive measures against oceanic errors. To mitigate the possibility of the aforementioned errors, pilots as individuals must increase their knowledge on cockpit procedures and airlines as organizations have to pay particular attention to training programs to implement appropriate preventive actions.","Over the past decade, the air traffic over the North Atlantic region has grown dramatically. In 2012, approximately 460,000 aircraft flew through the airspace of North Atlantic (ICAO, 2018). The average annual growth rate between 2013 and 2016 was reported as 6.1% for the entire NAT region (ICAO, 2017a). It was also noted that the projected annual growth rate for the trans-Atlantic air traffic between 2016 and 2020 would be 3.6% (ICAO, 2016). It is therefore noteworthy that, in parallel with this growth of the transatlantic air traffic and implementation of reduced lateral separation minimums over the North Atlantic airspace, navigation errors are highly likely to occur. There are three types of errors which are detrimental to the safety of trans-Atlantic air traffic. These are ====, ==== and ==== (ICAO, 2017b).====A lateral deviation from the route by 25 nautical miles or greater was classified as a Gross Navigation Error (GNE). However, this was re-defined as a lateral deviation of 10 nautical miles or higher after the commencement of the reduced lateral separation minimum (RLatSM) in 2017. In recent years, 123 lateral deviations have been caught despite the vastness of the airspace over the North Atlantic Ocean. 29 of the 123 lateral deviations from the cleared track or route were Gross Navigation Errors. Furthermore, 122 potential navigation errors (not greater than ten nautical miles) occurred and were detected. It was revealed that system failure and technical problems causing navigation errors are rare. However, poor cockpit procedures result in 80% of gross navigation errors (ICAO, 2018). Despite novel surveillance technologies and radar controls, infringements of commercial aircraft remains a key risk factor, and they are a significant threat to safety (Brooker, 2005; Gaxiola et al., 2018; Tu et al., 2010). In the North Atlantic airspace, this poses greater risk in comparison to controlled airspace because radar and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) coverage exists only in limited areas of the NAT HLA. Therefore, studies should focus on factors that contribute to the aforementioned errors and their prevalence to ensure continuous improvement of safety in aviation and accident prevention. With this in mind, the main goal of this study to find the most critical contributing factors by implementing a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) (Li et al., 2017) integrated into the HFACS framework and provide recommendations for prevention of lateral deviation in the North Atlantic High-Level Airspace (NAT HLA).====In this study, HFACS is used as a framework for the proposed methodology. FAHP is implemented to perform a numerical analysis. A hierarchical model is constructed with the AHP (Saaty, 1980) method, and the weights of the criteria are derived with the help of decision-makers in the aviation industry via fuzzy linguistic term sets to cover perceptional evaluations.",A hybrid approach based on the fuzzy AHP and HFACS framework for identifying and analyzing gross navigation errors during transatlantic flights,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303843,May 2019,2019,Research Article,489.0

Airport development and fleet orders by Australian airlines suggest that demand for long distance transportation will outstrip the most constrained airports in the mid-2020s. Government and private studies have addressed High Speed Rail (HSR) in Australia over the last 30 years. None has progressed beyond the concept stage. With no commitment to build HSR in Australia, domestic airlines have not defined a competitive response. Airport congestion ==== emerging in the Australian market may change that position. The market share split and market size for rail and air are estimated for the east coast market by testing likely travel times against international experience.","A relationship between elapsed journey time and market share capture by high-speed rail has been established in various studies, with stronger market share capture achieved on elapsed rail journey times below 3 h. This paper assesses the competitive risk posed by High Speed Rail (HSR) for Australian air carriers by applying European experience with HSR to existing Australian studies to assess the likely market share shift should HSR be introduced on the densely travelled east coast corridor between Melbourne and Sydney. (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7)====Since 1984, when the first attempt at defining a viable HSR proposal for Australia was undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), no fewer than fifteen different studies, discussion papers and proposals have been conducted and debated, at various levels of Australian government, and in the wider public arena. The studies focus on the East Coast corridor between the country's largest cities Sydney and Melbourne via the national capital Canberra. Studies that are more expansive extend the route considered as far north as Brisbane.====A number of the HSR studies have been government funded, but none has ever progressed beyond the conception stage or received government approval to proceed towards construction. The lack of funding or commitment to HSR by policy makers has continued through a period of steady growth in air travel on the east coast corridor, and suggests that HSR is unlikely to be built in Australia in the short term. In early 2017, the Federal Government committed to the construction of a second airport in Sydney, the busiest Australian gateway. Runway developments underway in Melbourne and Brisbane along with the second airport capacity for Sydney arguably allow government commitments to HSR to be further deferred.====In November 2013, then federal transport minister Warren Truss announced that Government was ready to start acquiring land corridors for HSR in cooperation with the state governments (SMH, 2013). Securing rail corridors at expanding city fringes is critical to the viability of a high-speed network. This land acquisition has not eventuated and current rail funding has instead been directed to building an inland freight rail link between Melbourne and Brisbane.====In the absence of government action on the construction of HSR, and given the lack of a longer-term timeline for implementation, Australian domestic airlines have seen little need to develop a competitive response to HSR competition. Little research on the potential impact of HSR on the Australian aviation sector has been published.====This paper is not intended to replicate the growing list of government-funded studies into the potential patronage of HSR services, nor to critique their methodologies. Rather the paper seeks to apply the relationship between journey time and market share experienced in developed economies in Europe to the potential Australian route between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney. Using the available Australian data and a model reflecting European HSR market share experience, this paper evaluates the potential impact to the domestic airlines that would flow from the introduction of HSR competition.",The potential impact of High Speed Rail development on Australian aviation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719300067,15 February 2019,2019,Research Article,490.0

In order to find potential destinations for airlines, this paper utilizes a compromise programming method for selecting direct flight routes. The selection framework comprises two objective functions, with one maximizing total revenue and the other minimizing total cost. A case studying Taiwan-European region destinations is interpreted in the analysis. The results indicate that four potential routes, including Madrid, Milan, Munich and Zurich should be added to the airlines’ service destinations. Therefore, this research suggested that the airport authority could apply incentives scheme to attract carriers to open new routes and add flight frequencies to strengthen its competitiveness.","According to the IATA (2015), the Asia Pacific market has been growing by an average of 8% per year over the last 10 years. In 2014, the seat capacity of scheduled airlines to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region reached 1.6 billion. Nearly 300,000 seats were added every day in 2014. By 2034, this region will see an extra 177 million passengers a year for a total market of 294 million passengers. In order to enjoy this growing market, the mission of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) is to transform itself into one of the Air Hubs in East Asia following its transformation from a government agency to a business organization in 2010 (Chang et al., 2017). However, the pursuit of such a goal has not seen much progress. In particular, more than fifty new routes between Taiwan and China have been launched since the opening of direct flights in 2008. The number is nearly half of TPE's total number of routes (see Fig. 1 for the details). As a result, more than half of TPE's new routes are short-haul routes. The lack of long-haul flights has weakened TPE's ability to attract transfer passengers and has forced its passengers to transfer at neighboring airports.====According to the statistics, the passenger traffic between Taiwan and Europe has been growing rapidly in the past decade. The growth was around one million in 2017 with the average growth rate being around 17% from 2001 to 2017 (see Fig. 2 for the details). However, the flight frequencies to European destinations offered by Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) are still low, being the lowest compared to the major Asian airports (see Fig. 3 for the details). Therefore, about two thirds of passengers traveling from Taiwan to Europe need to transfer at airports in Asia or the Middle East (see Table 1 for the details). As for these indirect passengers, 26% transfer in Hong Kong Airport, 25% in Dubai Airport and 15% in Istanbul Airport (see Table 2 for the details). As for the one-stop passengers, most of them transfer at Dubai airport due to Emirates Airlines offering daily flights from Taiwan to Dubai on an A380. Turkish Airlines also provides a daily flight from Taiwan to Istanbul that attracts passengers to transfer there when traveling between Europe and Taiwan.====As the Asia-Pacific region has become one of the biggest aviation markets in the world, increasing numbers of airports in this region are keen to develop into aviation hubs. Some Asian airlines have already launched long-haul direct flights to Europe to maintain their position. For example, three new routes have been launched between China (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen) and Brussels in recent years. A Chinese carrier, Shenzhen airlines, has also launched two new direct routes to Zurich and Madrid. Cathay Pacific will be launching new non-stop routes to three European capitals next summer – to Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen – with the carrier's A350 set to fly to all three in 2018. Singapore Airlines and its LCC subsidiary Scoot also plan to further grow their European networks. Singapore Airlines launched its Stockholm and Dusseldorf routes in 2017 and Scoot started to fly to Athens in 2017 and will add Berlin in 2018. On the other hand, European carriers have also started to offer direct flights to Taiwan. For example, KLM used to serve Taiwan with an intermediate stop in Bangkok, but since March 25 2012, KLM Asia has flown nonstop to and from Taiwan to become the first European airline to connect Taiwan nonstop with Europe. Air France Asia used to serve Taiwan directly between October 1993 and November 1995, and later switched the route by adding an intermediate stop in Bangkok. In 2017, Air France announced that it planned to resume its direct service between Paris CDG and Taiwan directly from April 2018. These new destinations will attract business and leisure travelers from all over the world. In the meantime, Air China is operating 20 routes from China to European destinations (see Table 3). Korean Airlines is also flying from Korea to 15 European destinations. Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways both offer direct flights on 13 European routes. However, the two Taiwanese carriers, China Airlines and EVA Airways, are only serving up to six EU destinations from Taiwan. Compared to their Asian counterparts, the limitation of flight destinations from Taiwan to Europe has not only increased traveling time for passengers transiting to Europe, but has also caused inconvenience to passengers (see Table 4). Therefore, this research utilizes a compromise programming method to find the most efficient direct flight routes from Taiwan to Europe. This model chooses a combination of destination networks that will meet the requirement to achieve maximum revenue while minimizing costs.",Airline new route selection using compromise programming - The case of Taiwan-Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303119,May 2019,2019,Research Article,491.0

Most research related to human fatigue in the ==== targets pilots, yet air traffic controllers also experience elevated levels of fatigue that affects aviation safety. Despite this, fatigue is often ignored in literature, as it is a mental and physical status that is difficult to measure. The International ==== Organization (ICAO) announced the concept of the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) in Annex 6 in 2011, which provides suggestions to reduce aircrew fatigue. In 2016, the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization (CANSO), ICAO, and the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations (IFATCA) published the Fatigue Management Guide for Air Traffic Service Providers and for the first time proposed recommendations for air traffic controllers (ATCs) to address this issue. Based on the management guide, this research used the Samn-Perelli fatigue scale to measure air traffic controllers' fatigue levels in an international aerodrome control tower in Taiwan. The results indicated that there were significant differences between day/night shifts, time periods (shift start time, before break time, after break time, and shift end time), and various ","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects 7.2 billion passengers to travel in 2035, nearly doubling the 3.8 billion air travelers in 2016 (IATA, 2016). Air transport, both passenger and cargo, is increasing, and the resulting shortage of laborers in the civil aviation industry has become a serious problem. Various job positions related to civil aviation, such as aircraft pilot, flight engineer, aircraft maintenance engineer, repairman, aircraft dispatcher, air traffic controller (ATC), flight crew, and ground crew, require long hours of training, with more than one year needed to train pilots and air traffic controllers. Moreover, due to staffing shortages many employees in this industry must work overtime. The result of high workloads can make people feel fatigued, thus increasing the possibility of human error and posing danger consequences to aviation safety.====The fatigue risk management of cabin and flight crews has gradually attracted more attention, with multiple studies discussing the possible risk factors of fatigue and how to reduce them. Yen et al. (2005, 2009) identified flight fatigue factors and offered valuable information to aviation regulators and airlines regarding the assigning of consecutively scheduled flights to the same aircrews. Banks et al. (2012) conducted a comparative analysis of international flight attendant fatigue regulations and collective bargaining agreements and found that U.S. prescriptive rules to manage flight attendant fatigue are among the least restrictive, representing a greater than typical fatigue risk. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced the concept of the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) in Annex 6 in 2011, which provides suggestions to reduce aircrew fatigue. However, fatigue among air traffic controllers tends to be ignored in literature.====Retirement, transfers to other administrative departments, or unpaid leave are possible reasons for the lack of laborers among air traffic controllers. While there are openings for recruiting controllers every year from the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) in Taiwan, due to the long training period and the strict process, only a few examinees are able to pass the test. For example, an examinee is required to pass two physical examinations, one written examination, and one oral examination, carry out job training for nearly a year, and then the examinee can finally take part in the Proficiency in Aviation Language (PAL) test. Therefore, there is a shortage of trained staff. Furthermore, the increasing number of aircraft movements and various emergencies (e.g. due to typhoons or other incidents) all serve to increase air traffic controllers' workloads. In 2016, the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization (CANSO), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations (IFATCA) together published the Fatigue Management Guide for Air Traffic Service Providers, which raised the importance of fatigue issues and provided recommendations to air traffic controllers.====While some studies have used the Samn-Perelli fatigue scale and other objective tools to measure pilot fatigue levels during their work (Honn et al., 2016; Pertrilli et al., 2006; Powell et al., 2007, 2008, 2010; Roach et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2015), none of these studies used air traffic controllers as the target to survey their fatigue levels under the various shift schedules. Taoyuan International Airport is Taiwan's largest and busiest airport, and in 2006 there were approximately 160,000 aircraft movements, which increased to more than 240,000 movements in 2016 (Taoyuan Airport Taiwan, 2016). This study uses air traffic controllers in the aerodrome control tower at Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport as the main target to measure ATCs' fatigue levels by using the Samn-Perelli fatigue scale. In order to improve the fatigue risk management system for air traffic controllers, the aim of this study is to explore their fatigue levels under the current schedule, propose improvement recommendations, and serve as a fatigue risk management reference for the Civil Aviation Administration and Air Traffic Service Providers.",Effects of work shifts on fatigue levels of air traffic controllers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699717305525,May 2019,2019,Research Article,492.0

Passengers from, to and within this region are expected to have the annual growth rate of 2.7% in the next 20 years, with an overall market size of 1.4 billion. This region will still cater for an additional 591 million passengers a year (IATA, 2014a). As for air cargo traffic over the next 20 years, the markets between Europe and Asia, North America, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa will grow as fast as the world average annual growth rate of 4.7%, although intra-Europe market will show the lowest annual growth rate of 2.0% in the world (IATA, 2014b). Meanwhile, passengers from, to and within Asia are expected to account for nearly half of global passenger traffic in the next 20 years, with an overall market size of 2.9 billion (IATA, 2014a). This region will also lead the world in the growth of air cargo traffic. Domestic China and intra-Asia markets will expand at the annual growth rate of 6.7% and 6.5%, respectively, while Asia-North America and Asia-Europe markets will grow slightly faster than the world average growth rate of 4.7% (IATA, 2014b).====Meanwhile, Europe and Asia have witnessed the most intense cross border competition on the globe among major cities to become a key traffic hub for international aviation. This may be facilitated in Europe by the expansion of current airports in London/Heathrow, Madrid, Barcelona, Milan/Malpensa and Frankfurt and by the construction of a new international airport in Munich in 1992. Berlin is scheduled to open an international airport by expanding Schönefeld, which will become a single commercial airport serving this city. Asia has seen much more examples of that, where new international airports opened one after another in the 1990's and 2000's in Shenzhen (1991), Osaka/Kansai (1994), Macau (1995), Kuala Lumpur (1998), Hong Kong (1998), Shanghai/Pudong (1999), Seoul/Incheon (2001), Guangzhou (2004), Nagoya/Chubu (2005), Tianjin (2005) and Bangkok/Suvarnabhumi (2006). Tokyo/Narita, Tokyo/Haneda, Singapore/Changi and Taipei/Taoyuan responded by expanding their capacities, including new runways or terminals. Beijing and Ho Chi Minh City are scheduled to start the construction of a new international airport in 2019 and in 2023, respectively.====On the other hand, three global air-freight integrators, DHL, FedEx and UPS, have developed their hub-and-spoke networks in these regions by establishing global or regional hubs. Their European and Asian hubs are drastically changing the urban pattern of international air cargo transport in these regions. Within Europe, DHL puts its main hub in Leipzig and several regional hubs in Amsterdam, Brussels, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, among others. FedEx has its main hub in Cologne and regional hubs in Frankfurt, London and Paris. Within Asia, Hong Kong is a main hub of DHL. Its regional hubs include Bangkok, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Taipei. FedEx establishes its main hubs in Guangzhou and Shanghai and regional hubs in Hong Kong, Osaka, Singapore, Taipei and Tokyo. Meanwhile, Shenzhen is a main hub of UPS and Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore are its regional hubs.====Hence, there has been a major re-alignment in hub roles within these two regions, providing the potential to change the hierarchical structure of hub cities.

This field of research was originally (in the late 1980's) referred to as Airport Level of Service (LOS), and saw a transfer of previous theory and practical experience of highway and pedestrian planning to the airport business (Ashford, 1988). Müller and Gosling (1991) subsequently recognized that an analytical framework measuring the level of service provided by an airport passenger terminal is a critical component of airport land side planning. The authors are the first to argue that such measurement needs both: (1) to consider individual users' perceptions of the terminal; and (2) to synthesize a multidimensional scale into a single service quality figure.====In 1992, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) launched the Global Airport Monitor scheme (ACI, 2004) which ran for 11 years. The Airport Council International (ACI) association started its own service quality program in 2000 (ACI, 2000), which was merged with IATA's Global Airport Monitor into a new program in 2004 called the AETRA customer satisfaction survey (ACI, 2004), jointly managed by IATA and ACI for the following two years. Since then, ACI has run the most important program alone. ACI's Airport Service Quality (ACI/ASQ) program measures worldwide airport passengers' satisfaction through surveys administered at airport facilities, and it is used by participating airports to: (1) analyse how passengers rate the airport's services; (2) compare performance to other airports around the world of similar traffic type and size; (3) identify the critical factors for the airport's success; and (4) see how passengers' concerns change over time (ACI, 2017). The ACI/ASQ's Airport Service Quality scale employs 34 attributes under the umbrella of eight different airport processes. Most recent studies on airport service quality (ASQ) are based to some extent on a subset of the whole list of the 34 attributes used by ACI/ASQ (Bezerra and Gomes, 2016; Bogicevic et al., 2013; Chou et al., 2011; Fernandes and Pacheco, 2008; Lupo, 2015).====Unfortunately, the ACI/ASQ database is not open to the research community, and much of the previous literature focuses on only a limited number of airports —in many cases the analysis is made using only one airport— and with a questionnaire designed for research-specific purposes using a list of only those attributes that define the ASQ object of study. Bezerra and Gomes (2016) contend that “… ====.” The main problems suggested by the authors arise from two issues: (1) The list of the ASQ attributes might not cover all the airport service aspects relevant to passengers; and (2) relevant issues for the development of ASQ scales, such as validity and reliability, have not been studied. Thus, the results and the conclusions of some studies might lead to misguided and erroneous managerial actions.====Much of the previous literature on ASQ is based on the administration of ad-hoc survey questionnaires that measure passengers’ perceptions for a list of ASQ attributes. However, it can be argued that administering questionnaires at airport facilities is becoming a burden, in terms of not only cost but also additional issues such as security and passenger comfort. As a result, additional approaches based on the analysis of the digital footprint left by passengers in some online communities, blogs, specialized internet sites, and social media, among others, are becoming new database substitutes (Gitto and Mancuso, 2017; Xiang et al., 2017). Research problems in many disciplines might benefit from the use of user-generated content. Indeed, the new datasets foster opportunities for the development of new research methods that complement conventional data analysis.====Clearly, in the internet age there are numerous platforms that encourage comments and feedback about different services (user-generated content). TripAdvisor, ====, Expedia and Travelocity, among other online travel agencies (OTAs), are good examples of this type of resource, containing consumers' ratings and reviews of hotels (Xiang et al., 2017). Regarding airports, SKYTRAX is a specialized blog that provides independent passengers' reviews on airport services (Gitto and Mancuso, 2017). Xiang et al. (2017) analyse 22 articles within the field of hospitality and tourism that study the topic of online reviews and find that: (1) TripAdvisor is the most popular source used in the field and hotels is the sector that receives the most attention; (2) Yelp is also a popular resource that has been used to analyse restaurants. Their paper researches a variety of topics like travel motivations, the impact of online reviews on a company's performance, and tourist satisfaction determinants. We can assume that these internet resources will only multiply over time.====To our knowledge, there are no previous studies analysing user-generated content from social media in the airport sector. Nevertheless, Halpern (2012) has investigated a large sample of international airports’ official social media use and found that 13% use Facebook, 12% use Twitter, 7% use LinkedIn and 4% use YouTube. The author also found that social media is used more often by airports in North America and Europe, by larger airports, and by airports that are owned and/or operated by private companies (p. 67). Additionally, Díaz and Martín-Consuegra (2016), analysing a sample of 240 airline websites, found that there are three different airline segments (1) influential; (2) follower; and (3) passive. Finally, Gitto and Mancuso (2017) measured ASQ as perceived by passengers using data extracted from SKYTRAX and analysed this with similar sentiment analysis software to this study.====The goal of this paper is to explore how sentiment analysis techniques can be used to identify new insights beyond those provided by more traditional methods. User-generated content extracted from the social network Twitter in one of the world's major airports, London Heathrow (LHR), is used as the data source. The paper provides a basis for making comparisons between the service attributes listed on the ACI's ASQ scale and contributes to an area which is still in its infancy: the development of social media analytics in the aviation industry.",Social media as a resource for sentiment analysis of Airport Service Quality (ASQ),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719300079,18 January 2019,2019,Research Article,496.0

In most countries, airports are no longer only a necessary connecting point; instead, they are a source of economic development providing a gateway to cities, states, regions, countries and cultures. In 2014, the economic impact of the aviation industry (direct, indirect, induced and tourism catalytic) on the global gross domestic product (GDP) exceeded $2.7 trillion USD; none of this would be possible without airports (Airports Council International, 2017). Moreover, the deregulation of the air transport market has increased the level of competition among airports to attract passengers and airlines. In this new environment, airport management companies are pursuing strategies focalised to improve customer experience of air travel and tourism. The airport becomes one key element in the consumer process of travel planning, after the initial decision to make the journey. This process, named the travel ecosystem (see Fig. 1), is deeply permeated by digital technologies (World Economic Forum, 2017), given their capacity to attract, gather and communicate information to and from consumers.====According to the World Economic Forum (2017), from 2016 to 2025, digitalization in aviation, travel and tourism is expected to generate, along with other effects, benefits valued at $700 billion USD for customers and a wider society through a reduced environmental footprint, improved safety and security, and cost and time savings for consumers. In particular, for customers, the personal impact is expected to be significant as travel becomes a seamless, frictionless, higher-quality experience. This new environment has led airport managers to develop new strategies, such as differentiation with branding, to gain a competitive advantage.====Competition in the airport industry assumes a complex form, exerting its main effects at three different levels (Graham, 2013): competition among groups of airports, competition among airports and competition inside airports. The second level is related to competition among airports belonging to the same catchment area. This frequently occurs in the major urban areas where there exists more than one airport. When the airports are operated as a group, the result of competition can be controversial. In fact, for airports belonging to the same catchment area, this has led to a mitigation of competition (Forsyth, 2006). However, the advantages that result from working as a group rely, on one hand, on the adoption of a coordinated development strategy, and on the other, on the reduction of costs through the sharing of resources and expertise and the positive effects due to the economies of scale. The latter level of competition concerns the wide range of airport services that can be provided by both the airport operator and an external company. redo.====Moreover, the steady increase of non-aeronautical revenues has transformed airports, in some cases, into shopping centres that serve as the catalyst for local economic development (Castillo-Manzano, 2010) where passengers' shopping motivations are often analysed (Lin and Chen, 2013). The way in which aeronautical and non-aeronautical services are offered and the related degree of competition affect an airport's competitive environment in terms of both price and service quality (Han et al., 2012; Graham, 2013; Bracaglia et al., 2014; D'alfonso and Nastasi, 2014; Lo Storto, 2018).====Because of the increasing competition in the airport industry and the increasing importance of non-aeronautical revenues and services, marketing has increased its relevance in the airport business, and the concept of brand perception is an emerging issue (Malhi, 2014). Thus, the managers of airports should study their positions relative to their competitors. Through branding strategies, airports pursue the objective of presenting a unique and differentiated offering to stakeholders, passengers and the community (Chung et al., 2013). By branding successfully, airports can improve their competitive position and employ the brand as support for increasing the sales of related products and services. Moreover, the airport's brand represents the perception of its customers, and it is associated with the thoughts that arise whenever customers think about a particular airport. In this framework, the airport logo and name are not the airport brand, but rather should be representations of the brand (Paternoster, 2008).====The growth of social media platforms provides new opportunities for brand-related marketing researches (Plumeyer et al., 2017). The activities on these platforms come from two directions: airport companies use these channels to support activities, providing customer service and information; passengers are able to interact with airports and other people by writing online comments about their experiences in an airport. This has become a new source of data for brand image measurement, namely brand-related user-generated content (Plumeyer et al., 2017). The potential of social media in this marketing area is growing at a fast pace: in 2020, the number of web connections will be approximately 26 × 10====, with a 30-fold increase as compared to the number of connections installed in 2009 (Kar, 2013).====Airports have recently started to use social media, and there has been a growing interest seen among practitioners. Halpern and Graham (2013) underlined that the main focus of airport social media appears to be on developing the airport's image and reputation by engaging directly and efficiently with its online community. Other scholars have analysed social media data of airport companies and the marketing implications of that data. Gitto and Mancuso (2017) showed how to evaluate the quality of services in some airports by employing social media and sentiment analysis. Nigam et al. (2011) examined the role of social media for engaging customers and for expanding business opportunities at airports. Using data on nine airports, the paper of Wattanacharoensil and Schuckert (2015) discussed the use of Facebook posts to gain additional information on customers' attitudes to promote products and services. Nghiêm-Phú and Suter (2018) used content analysis of online reviews of passengers to examine the attributes of a single airport and the association of those attributes with the city of Las Vegas. Lee and Yu (2018) assessed the airport service quality of airports using Google reviews. They validated their study by comparing the results obtained from Google reviews with airport service quality surveys, and they found a high correlation in the ratings for the top 100 airports.====Further studies on brand management in the airport industry are sparse. However, in one extant study, Lee and Park (2016) collected 304 questionnaires from employees of the Incheon International Airport, and they analysed the relationships among the factors of sustainable brand, social media and business performance. Also, Chung et al. (2013) determined the airport's brand value with a financial technique, considering a sample of seven international airports. The cited papers used traditional surveys and qualitative or sentiment analysis; however, they inferred customer perceptions based on a small sample of airports.====In this work, we study the brand perception of airports using social network data. In particular, we apply the approach proposed by Culotta and Cutler (2016) by analysing the social connections (that is, the followers) of airports on Twitter. This novel methodology allows overcoming the weaknesses of both the traditional approaches based on surveys and on data mining techniques applied to web pages or online posts. The surveys are costly and time-consuming and quickly become outdated. However, data mining techniques based on text analysis require external data and context customization due to the unstructured text format of the majority of web data (Li and Wu, 2010; Culotta and Cutler, 2016). The method that we apply allowed us to identify the customers' perceptions of international airports with respect to luxury, disability and environment. Two goals are reached: the first is to identify specific characteristics of the airports and/or the passengers’ preferences using cluster analysis. The second is to identify the current positions of airports in the perceptions of the customers.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the brand attributes and their relevance in the airport industry.

Even many common people's necessities that are common to the public have caused the public's health to be impaired, which in turn affects the public's trust in food safety causing great concern in society. Therefore, an airline choosing a catering supplier that meets food safety regulations is the core research problem of this paper.====In order to achieve a competitive advantage in an intense business environment, more and more airlines began to outsource their business (Rieple and Helm, 2008). The main reasons for outsourcing include cost savings, focus on core technologies, and maintaining management flexibility. The outsourcing of non-core activities, in addition to saving labor costs, can also quickly respond to the needs of customers (Hsu and Liou, 2013). Financial risks can also be lessened by reducing funding in capital investments (Ellram et al., 2008). The catering operator is a provider of outsourcing services to the airlines, and their products represent the airline's service quality, which will affect customer's satisfaction and also loyalty to the airline (An and Noh, 2009; Kaya and Azaltun, 2012).====Rhoades and Waguespack (2008) believed that customers assess airline service quality through factors which include on-time performance, airport check-in, seating comfort, flight attendant, after-sales services, food services, and frequent flyer programs (FFPs), especially providing the best quality food can avoid passenger dissatisfaction and thus increase the airline's brand image (Zaheer et al., 2013). Therefore, this study considers that the quality of in-flight food is related to the satisfaction of passengers and the willingness to re-board, which even further affects the competitive advantage of airlines. Therefore, how an airline chooses a safe and high quality catering supplier and establish a good partnership with it to increase customer's satisfaction is crucial for the airline.====Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is designed to help the decision maker (DM) to make a choice among a finite number of alternatives or to rank or sort a finite number of alternatives based on multiple criteria (Soylu, 2010). The catering supplier's selection is a MCDM issue, where the evaluation process mainly involves evaluating different catering suppliers according to a complex set of factors identifying the catering supplier's capabilities to meet airline's needs. The airline industry is a competitive environment, and airlines must perform well in terms of product/service factors to satisfy customer demands (Jarach, 2001). Understanding the factors that drive an airlines' selection of a catering supplier is the basis for achieving passenger's satisfaction and loyalty among these airlines.====The determination of the best catering supplier for airline needs consideration of many complex factors. The proposed MCDM approach which helps to reach important decisions cannot be determined by a straightforward approach (Wu et al., 2010). For complex problems, such as catering supplier selection, MCDM techniques, especially multi-objective goal programming is commonly used to determine complexity problems. A number of techniques have been proposed to solve the supplier selection problem. These approaches including techniques for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), linear programming (LP), goal programming (GP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), cost-point methods (CPM), analytical hierarchy process (AHP), analytic network process (ANP) and fuzzy set theory. However, these techniques are not perfect for catering supplier evaluation and selection because the available information in the airline context is inherently ambiguous, inaccurate, imprecise and uncertain by nature. The Analytical hierarchy process (AHP), Additive ratio assessment (ARAS), and Multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) method may be useful for various MCDM problems and Table 1 shows a comparison of this proposed analytical method with other analytical methods for supplier decision making.",An integrated approach to catering supplier selection using AHP-ARAS-MCGP methodology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303247,March 2019,2019,Research Article,498.0

However, there lack systematic quantifiers to distinguish the two airport types. The present paper investigates whether this remark still holds today, and if not, whether the change is a worldwide phenomenon. We first establish a systematic parameterization to classify airport types, based on aviation network connectivity, regional importance, and MAR (multi-airport region) effects. With this classification of world airports, our analysis of the latest empirical data shows that some previously indubitable features of LCCs might have slowly changed. In particular, LCCs are expanding fast at both upper-tiers’ and lower-tiers’ airports, and there is a trend of shifting airport choice from lower-tiers’ to upper-tiers’ airports for LCCs in some continents. The evolving competition relationship between the full-service carriers (FSCs) and LCCs is also discussed.","The success of low-cost carriers (LCCs) business model is arguably one of the most significant events in the airline industry for the past 20 years. Since Southwest Airlines began its operation in the 1970s, the LCCs development has spread from North America to Europe, and then to Latin America, Oceania, and Asia today. LCCs in the Middle East also recorded extraordinary growth very recently. Per CAPA World Aviation Yearbook (2014), the LCCs capacity share of total seats accounted for only 0.9% in 2004, but the share jumped to over 60% in early 2014 within South Asia region (p.31). Gradual liberalization of the aviation market certainly plays a big role in the growth. LCCs have been proved to be an efficient intercity transport mode in terms of stimulating traffic and lowering prices (e.g., Dresner et al., 1996; Morrison, 2001; Hofer et al., 2008; Clewlow et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017a; Zhang and Zhang, 2016).====One of the major differences between LCCs and traditional full-service carriers (FSCs) is the choice of airports to base their operation. FSCs tend to use “primary airports”, due partly to their adoption of a hub-and-spoke model. Before the rise of LCCs, in the 1980s and 1990s, Button (2002), Reynolds-Feighan (2001), and many studies concluded that the hub-and-spoke network was the dominating operation model in the airline industry. Although the hub-and-spoke system may help airlines to save costs and gain strategic advantages (e.g., Oum et al., 1995), the operational complexity can increase the expenses due, for example, to congestion and delays at hub airports. The complex baggage handling systems at a hub airport, long aircraft turnaround times, rapid increases of no-connection rates under bad weather conditions, high airline labour costs at hubs, and additional peak capacity costs, can all contribute to high hubbing costs (de Wit and Zuidberg, 2012).====On the other hand, LCCs operate in a point-to-point system, and very often use “secondary airports”. Specifically, when LCCs started to expand their markets, they had the tendency to spread their capacity and routes more evenly across non-traditional hubs (e.g., secondary airports) in their networks to eliminate the high hubbing costs (Graham and Shaw, 2008; Reynolds-Feighan, 2010; Suau-Sanchez and Burghouwt, 2011; Wang et al., 2017b). In fact, the predominant use of underutilized secondary airports has long been considered as one core feature differentiating LCCs from traditional FSCs (Gillen and Morrison, 2003; Barrett, 2004; Dobruszkes, 2006; Zhang et al., 2008; Pels et al., 2009). The aviation network was observed to be de-concentrating through the expansion of LCCs business, especially in the US and Europe (Bel and Fageda, 2008; Suau-Sanchez and Burghouwt, 2011). Even though there are studies suggesting LCCs in the US might operate their business in a hub-and- spoke manner (except for Southwest), the base airports they chose for hubs are mainly located on the “geographic periphery of the country”, such as Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport for Spirit Airlines, and Phoenix–Mesa Gateway Airport for Allegiant Air, which are generally considered as “non-primary airports” (Vowles and Lück, 2013).====A detailed review of more recent literature indicates that LCCs tend to configure their networks around secondary airports is only true for some but not all LCCs' business model. According to Suau-Sanchez et al. (2016), though some LCCs such as Ryanair, set up their bases in smaller airports, there are still several major LCCs operated out of larger airports, such as easyJet, Vueling, and Germanwings. Even if LCCs all have a common tendency of concentrated networks (since they mostly operate out of a few airports as home bases); their different market strategies could lead to different concentrating or deconcentrating impact on air traffic among the airport hierarchy. They found that at the aggregate level, intra-EU seat capacity deconcentrated, while extra-EU seat capacity concentrated from 1990 to 2009. In addition, several studies also indicated that some major LCCs are moving forward in the direction of hubbing activities (de Wit and Zuidberg, 2012; Fichert and Klophaus, 2016), which would also increase their networks’ concentration. In short, LCCs operating at different region chose different expansion strategies.====In addition, LCCs' business models are evolving with the global aviation industry development. While there are still some distinct LCCs’ characteristics generally agreed among studies, in practice, other previously indubitable features of the LCCs business model appear blurring (Franke and John, 2011). In the dynamic LCCs market, diversified operation strategies and a trend towards hybridization are observed (Klophaus et al., 2012; Dziedzic and Warnock-Smith, 2016; Zuidberg and de Wit, 2016). In particular, over the past years some studies have suggested a tendency of LCCs business shifting from secondary airports to more primary airports (de Wit and Zuidberg, 2012; Dobruszkes, 2013; Vowles and Lück, 2013; Halpern et al., 2016; Dobruszkes et al., 2017). A holistic examination on LCCs development and business models in the recent few years may shed light for airport and airline future planning.====Among these latest studies, a few limitations were found. First, all of them focus only on the US and European markets. Second, majority of them did not offer a clear definition of how primary or secondary airports were classified. Notwithstanding a few studies (Dziedzic and Warnock-Smith, 2016; Dobruszkes et al., 2017) have offered definitions for how primary or secondary airports were classified, their classifications were mainly based on the size of the airport catchment area, i.e. the population of metropolitan area, or the size of the airport within a multiple airport region, which perhaps is, we believe, not the best way to apply in classifying airports in different parts of the world (particularly when metropolitan area or functional urban area are not well defined outside the US or Europe). This point will be discussed in detail in Section 3.====In this paper, we attempt to extend and complement the above studies by establishing an objective parameterization through the inclusion of topological metrics, continental importance, and effect on multi-airport region (MAR) to differentiate world airport classes, which may contribute as an equitable ground for future aviation studies. With the sophisticatedly constructed airport classification, we first examine which type(s) of airport have fastest LCCs growth. We then investigate whether the trend of shifting airport choice from lower-tiers’ to upper-tiers’ airports among LCCs is a worldwide phenomenon, by having a closer look across different continents of the world. The reason behind the suggested shift in airport selection will also be discussed.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our data collection, followed by our proposed parameterization of airport classes in Section 3. Section 4 presents the results and discussion.

Results show that, in 2014, Peruvian domestic air transport was responsible for emitting approximately 657,446 MT of CO====. This is equivalent to US$4.7 million, US$60.33 per one-way flight or 8.7 cents per km. If only the less-polluting aircrafts were used, CO==== emissions would be reduced by 2.8%. If instead of having to use Lima's airport as a hub there were direct connections among the country's seven busiest airports, yearly emissions would be reduced by 3.8%. A large part of the savings in this scenario (45%) would come from eliminating LTO cycles. Both scenarios combined would save the environment 40,893 MT of CO==== per year (6.2%).","Since 1950, global air transport of passengers and freight has grown at rates of approximately 5% and 6% per year, respectively. If demand continues at this pace, it would double every 14 years for passenger services and every 12 years for freight operations. In absence of any change, the environmental impact of aviation would grow at similar rates (Schäfer and Waitz, 2014). Currently, aviation accounts for around 2% of all human-induced CO==== emissions, which, in 2015, rose to 781 million MT (ATAG, 2010).====Aviation also contributes to climate change by non-CO==== impacts, such as ozone and methane changes from NO==== emissions or contrails and contrail cirrus. While many countries have started to regulate CO==== emissions, there are few that regulate non-CO==== effects, probably because aviation-induced clouds and the effects of NO==== emissions at cruise altitudes are not fully understood by the atmospheric sciences (Scheelhaase et al., 2016).====Technology improvements facilitate air transport by reducing costs and lowering emissions of hazardous gases (Gardi et al., 2016; Strohmeier et al., 2014). This has allowed airlines to increase the frequency of flights in certain routes and to improve the connectivity of air transport's complex network. (Lin and Ban, 2014).====However, more sound policies are needed to mitigate the impact of air transport in the environment. To produce these policies, better information regarding these effects is needed. This requirement is more urgent in emerging economies, where problems regarding the lack of data and information are largely known.====The purpose of this paper is to estimate CO==== emissions from Peru's domestic air transport==== and how much they would be reduced if the network, currently centered around Lima's airport, was organized differently. This is basic and relevant information for public policy making that has not been estimated before. Results could be used as an input to assess how to internalize the externalities caused by aviation to society and to suggest the orientation the environmental policy regarding this mode of transport should take.====Estimations have been performed using route, frequency and aircraft-related data of all domestic flights that departed or landed at Lima airport (LIM) in 2014, a hub that accounts for 93% of the country's domestic air passenger traffic. CO==== emissions were estimated using a methodology proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) that differentiates fuel usage during each phase of a flight. Results were then converted into their monetary equivalent using Peru's official shadow price of carbon—an input used for the evaluation of the country's public investment projects— and later used to analyze how much they would be reduced if the country's air transport network was organized differently.====The following section presents a brief literature review of the topic. The third section discusses the characteristics of Peru's air transport network and briefly describes the methodology used.

With the ultimate aim of becoming fully integrated into the European Union aviation market, these airlines underwent significant transformations in the last two decades. The study utilizes the Fuzzy Theory-based ==== to evaluate efficiency of the airlines since some of the indices (e.g. punctuality) could be subject to imprecise measurement. The set of airlines contains several major airlines operating in Western, Central and South-East Europe in 2008 and 2012, the years that coincide with the economic crisis and overall financial recovery. The results of the model indicate that Central and South-East European carriers tend to be less efficient in comparison to Western counterparts over the period observed, but their overall efficiency has generally improved based on the Malmquist index. Moreover, based on the calculation of the Malmquist index one can reveal that despite the fact that most of the Central and South-East Europe airlines succeeded to increase their technical efficiency through adoption of new technologies, they still remained out of the efficient frontier.","The airline industry has become an extensively competitive environment imposing a burden of challenges to its players requiring adoption of radical changes in order to survive. Deregulation of the aviation market in the United States in 1977 triggered a wave of regulatory changes across the world, serving as a good example particularly to Europe and Australia. In such new environment, almost all state-owned European airlines have been either partially or fully privatized (Barbot et al., 2008), which induced fierce competition among them. In addition to the well-established airlines, the emergence of low-cost business model has permanently altered the landscape of the battlefield by offering air fares significantly lower than those offered by incumbent carriers. Airline profitability was further damaged in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 and the world financial crisis of 2008 thus bringing a vast number of carriers to the edge of bankruptcy. As reported in Zacks Equity Research (2011), the airline industry lost $16 billion in 2008 and $9.9 billion in 2009, the periods that coincided with skyrocketing oil prices and severe world-wide recession.====In order to survive the new market conditions, many international flag carriers across Europe chose to consolidate their operations and created economies of scale through Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) (Min and Joo, 2016). On the other hand, a vast number of them decided to avoid the risk of possible M&A failures, and have instead joined some of the global airline alliances or simply cooperated through code-share agreements. Among airlines in Europe, the airlines that persisted in post-socialist countries located in Central (CE) and South-East Europe (SEE) were severely hit by these events as they had to adjust their business models to the new market conditions, already bearing the heavy burden of their historical and political heritage. Moreover, there is ample evidence that these carriers have exerted the characteristics of “permanently failing organization” (Akbar et al., 2014) that adversely affected their performance and deteriorated their ability to accommodate to the new market rules. Bearing in mind that these airlines have not been in the focus of the relevant literature, investigation of their performance has become the particular challenge of this research. The paper contributes to the current literature by providing a comparison of efficiency between these carriers and their well-established counterparts in the rest of Europe. This becomes of vital importance as it enables a carrier to position itself against the rivals and to detect the roots of its inefficiency.====The paper performs an analysis of the comparative efficiency of airlines operating across the region of Europe in the new market context in the years 2008 and 2012. The efficiency measures are calculated by a non-parametric approach known as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) which has particular applicability in the airline industry. Bearing in mind that some of the inputs/outputs in a DEA model can be subject to imprecise measurements, but still highly affect an airline's efficiency, a fuzzy-based DEA approach has been employed as an appropriate tool. Productivity is measured by the Malmquist index and defined as the ratio between efficiency, as calculated by the DEA, for the same airline in two different time periods. The sample contains 17 airlines that operate across Europe.====The paper is structured as follows. After a brief Introduction, Section 2 provides literature review on airline efficiency evaluation. Section 3 highlights some important characteristics of the airlines from CE and SEE against a description of socio-economic background of CE and SEE countries. Section 4 describes the methodology used, followed by Section 5 that provides the essential information on the data and the specification of inputs and outputs. Section 6 provides an analysis of explanatory analysis performed and a discussion of the efficiency scores obtained by the DEA and the Malmquist index.

We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of these findings.","Consumer perceptions and attitudes can strongly influence the success and failure of new technologies. There have been several studies that have examined the relationship between multiple variables (e.g., gender, nationality, flight distance, weather, number of pilots) and their influence on individuals' willingness to fly (WTF) on a fully autonomous flight (Mehta et al., 2017; Ragbir et al. 2018; Rice et al., 2014; Rice and Winter 2015; Winter et al., 2015).

Participants were most favorable toward cargo operations, which aligns with later research on that topic (Winter et al., 2015).

However, to date, there is no literature that provides a ==== of an individual passenger's WTF in an autonomous aircraft. With the aviation industry's increased use of automation, it is vital to understand passengers' views and WTF on an autonomous flight. Many factors can influence an individual's WTF; thus, the purpose of this study was twofold: (1) determine which factors influenced passengers' WTF to fly in an autonomous commercial airliner and (2) validate a predictive model of WTF in an autonomous aircraft for future use.",What factors predict the type of person who is willing to fly in an autonomous commercial airplane?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718304721,March 2019,2019,Research Article,503.0

The results show that joint investments are necessary for innovation in service, price promotion, and event sponsorship in order to strengthen the key consumer-based brand dimensions. This study provides a basis for the development of future studies on passenger-based brand equity and helps airlines target their marketing strategies with maximum effectiveness.","Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, the passenger air transport sector in several countries underwent market liberalization (Lieshout et al., 2016; Koo and Lohmann, 2013). This reduced market entry barriers and increased competitors (mainly low-cost airlines), leading to a price war and impacting airline results, especially in developing countries such as Brazil (Lieshout et al., 2016; Koo and Lohmann, 2013; Hooper, 1997). Brazil's airlines have accumulated consecutive losses since 2011. A negative net result on the order of USD 1.3 billion was incurred in 2015, almost triple the negative result recorded in 2011 (of over USD 400 million). This result was influenced by the increase in operating costs and the sharp decline in the average tariff in the domestic market. The average value paid per kilometer in the domestic market in 2015 was 60.4% lower than the amount in 2006 (ANAC, 2016). It has thus become necessary to seek alternative measures to help Brazilian airlines recover.====One alternative is differentiation through factors other than the price of service, such as investments in the value passengers perceive in the brand (Pearson et al., 2015; Chen and Tseng, 2010; Chen and Chang, 2008). A strong brand that is valued by passengers can convey quality and credibility, add value to the air transport service, and increase passengers’ willingness to pay a premium on ticket prices (Pearson et al., 2015). Consumer-based brand equity can be strengthened through successful marketing-mix strategies (Yoo et al., 2000). However, research on how to strengthen consumer-based brand equity has been scarce in the air transport sector (Uslu et al., 2013; Chen and Tseng, 2010).====Uslu et al.’s (2013) study on the air transport sector indicates that passenger perceptions of an airline brand are constructed through brand associations combined with brand awareness, perceived quality, and brand loyalty. Strengthening these dimensions increases passengers' preference for the brand, their purchase intention, and their level of satisfaction with the company's services (Lin, 2015; Chen and Chang, 2008). However, what marketing strategies should airlines use to strengthen consumer-based brand equity? To answer this question, this study examines the relationship between the marketing strategies adopted by Brazilian airlines in the domestic market and the strengthening three consumer-based brand equity dimensions: brand associations with brand awareness, perceived quality, and brand loyalty.",Market strategy development and innovation to strengthen consumer-based equity: The case of Brazilian airlines,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699717304386,March 2019,2019,Research Article,505.0

Currently, the adequate and timely adjustment of airfare pricing is regarded as common sense in the air transport industry. With dynamic pricing, seat allocation based on a nested fare structure is also generally used in this field. There is no doubt that efficient decision making about both airfare pricing and seat allocation is the key factor of airline revenue management (Morrison and Winston, 1990). In the case of seat allocation based on a nested fare structure, it is common to apply within the same set of physical seats, mainly economy class seats. In addition, the decision making about seat allocation based on a nested fare structure can be performed differently on every flight based on their load factors.====However, the importance of physical seat allocation for first, business and economy classes within the limited space of an aircraft tends to increase to cope with various customer needs in the complex and competitive air transport industry. Basically, the physical seat allocation of an aircraft is determined before purchasing a new aircraft considering the features of candidate flight-legs because it cannot be changed on every flight. Nevertheless, airlines can change the physical seat allocation of certain aircraft when its main operating flight-legs are switched from long-haul to short-haul or vice versa. When a passenger travels a long distance, the demand for a premium seat, such as first and business classes, tends to increase. In addition, an airline tries to increase economy class seat pitches for the convenience of passengers travelling long distances. On the contrary, an airline can determine the seat density of certain aircraft higher when the aircraft is operated mainly on short distances. Then the airline can add more economy class seats to increase the maximum number of passengers on board. That kind of physical seat allocation change can occur periodically when an airline adjusts the overall fleet assignment according to the changed customer features of its operation network. Moreover, though the physical seat allocation cannot be changed on every flight, certain aircraft which have a similar seat allocation, can be selected and operated on a specific flight-leg. Nowadays, the overall customer demand in the air transport industry in Asia has been increasing significantly, according to the economic growth of China, India and countries from Southeast Asia (Guo et al., 2007). However, customer demand on a specific flight-leg can be totally changed because of certain reasons, such as political issues and so on. Therefore, airlines belonging to Asian countries are trying to adjust their fleet assignment periodically, including the physical seat allocation of several aircraft. Moreover, subsidiary low cost carriers are established by several full service carriers competing against rival low cost carriers. As a result, a full service carrier should consider its physical seat allocation, not only the space of its own aircraft, but also the physical seat allocation from its subsidiary low cost carrier operated in same flight-leg.====Initially, the dominant market structure in the air transport industry was oligopoly. However, recently, it is a common phenomenon that there are two or more airlines operating on the same route, and a lot of airlines tend to be newly established due to the increasing demand of the air transport market, especially in East Asia (Chung and Wu, 2016). Under these competitive market situations, full service carriers (FSCs) are trying to survive against rival low cost carriers (LCCs) with several kinds of strategies. In the case in which both FSCs and LCCs are operating on the same route, FSCs should prepare their countermeasures carefully against rival LCCs because the cheap airfare of LCCs can be regarded as an attractive advantage for potential passengers who want to use the air transport service with reasonable costs.====As countermeasures of FSCs, firstly, FSCs can newly establish either a low cost ‘no frills’ division or subsidiary LCC as the type of airline within an airline. Otherwise, FSCs can try to get rid of several significant cost elements by maintaining their business model or by reducing their conventional service level (Morrell, 2005). FSCs' strategies of launching the subsidiary LCC to compete with rival LCCs will be investigated in this study. Actually, a significant number of FSCs have adopted the airline within airline model, and that business model seems to be applied quite well, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region (Pearson and Merkert, 2014). In the case of Qantas, an FSC airline from Australia, established its subsidiary LCC, Jetstar, and it has successfully operated to date. In addition, Jetstar operated not only a short haul on their domestic line, but also medium and long haul on international lines in Asia-Pacific. Moreover, Jetstar has tried to extend its business range by newly launching Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Vietnam (Whyte and Lohmann, 2015). Therefore, the motivation of this study comes from the current competitive market situation in the air transport industry and successful business models, such as an airline within an airline to compete with rival LCCs.====This study dealt with the operation policies of both FSCs and subsidiary LCCs against rival LCCs in terms of airfare pricing and seat allocation, which are key elements in revenue management of an airline. Because the demand of both the subsidiary LCC and the rival LCCs can influence the demand of the economy class of the FSC, the airfares of the economy class of the FSC and both subsidiary LCC and the rival LCC are considered simultaneously. In addition, due to the influenced demand of the economy class of the FSC, adjusting the seat allocation of each cabin class for FSC is required considering that both the subsidiary LCC and rival LCC because the subsidiary LCC can be regarded as the substitute products of the economy class of the FSC. According to the features of passenger demand of a certain flight-leg, the most profitable seat allocation can be differently decided in accordance with Fig. 1. Even though the physical seat allocation is hard to change in every flight, it can be decided efficiently by considering all the complex situations when the new aircraft is purchased and introduced. In addition, the most adequate aircraft can be assigned to a specific flight-leg among the aircraft of a certain airline which have various kinds of seat allocation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to derive an optimal airfare pricing and seat allocation for both FSCs and subsidiary LCCs to maximize the sum of their profits against rival LCCs using the repeated game situation. Also, no-shows and cancellations are introduced in this study to reflect the real situation in more detail.",The airfare pricing and seat allocation problem in full-service carriers and subsidiary low-cost carriers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699717305434,March 2019,2019,Research Article,506.0

This study examines the effects of two LPG terms—depth of refund and refund conditions—on customer perceptions and purchase intention. An experiment with a 2 × 2 factorial design was conducted with a sample of 282 adults, and ==== was used to test the model. The results show that refund depth increases customer purchase intention by enhancing perceptions of the believability and value of the LPG. Strict refund conditions enhance customer purchase intention by increasing the believability of the LPGs.","A common practice in airlines’ online ticket sales is the lowest price guarantee (LPG). By offering such a guarantee on its official website, an airline company promises to meet or beat a lower price for identical itineraries on competing websites. LPGs have been widely implemented on many airline websites, such as those of Singapore Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Air France and British Airways.====Although LPGs are emphasised heavily by airline companies on their websites, this promotional tool has received little attention in airline management literature. Investigating the influence of LPGs on airlines' websites is important for at least two reasons. First, offering an LPG on an airlines' ==== website may attract more customers to buy e-tickets there. Law and Leung (2000) found that at least 61% of the websites of 30 airlines offered site visitors some kind of promotional offer online. Given that ticket sales on airlines’ websites made up 23% of their ticket sales on all channels in 2015 (Strategy, 2016), and that price is the determining factor for many customers when purchasing an airline ticket (Escobar-Rodríguez and Carvajal-Trujillo, 2013), it is important for airline companies to understand the influence of an LPG on customer response.====Second, LPGs are different from typical price promotions in important ways (Kukar-Kinney and Walters, 2003; Srivastava and Lurie, 2004), which make them an interesting tool to study in the airline sector. While price promotions advertise a price reduction that usually lasts only for short periods of time, LPGs are based on long-term promises to sell goods at low prices by promising to match or beat competitors. LPGs also require customers to make more of an effort to obtain the lower prices than do price promotions.====Previous studies in economics and marketing have provided insights into the benefits of sellers offering LPGs (e.g., Kireyev et al., 2017; Srivastava and Lurie, 2004). Research suggests that an LPG signals that a particular seller is committed to lower price (Borges and Babin, 2012; Jain and Srivastava, 2000), which may reduce customer price searches at competitive sellers (Jiang et al., 2016; Srivastava and Lurie, 2001) and alleviate perceptions of price risk (Hardesty et al., 2012). Moreover, LPGs usually assume a variety of forms (Kukar-Kinney and Walters, 2003; Lin, 2015), which vary in terms of the refund depth (i.e., the amount of money the seller promises to refund the customer) and refund condition (i.e., the condition that make the consumer eligible for a refund) (Borges and Babin, 2012). LPG designs also have a strong impact on customer reactions (Baglione et al., 2016; Desmet and Le Nagard, 2005).====In practice, there is great variability in LPG design on airline websites in terms of refund depth and refund conditions (USA today, 2018). Regarding refund depth, some airline companies (e.g., British Airways) offer an LPG that will match a lower price (e.g., refund the difference between the price of the ticket purchased and the lower price offered on another website), while others (e.g., Air France) offer an LPG to beat the lower price (e.g., to match the lower price, and add a voucher of $100 for future travel). Regarding refund conditions, some airline companies (e.g., KLM Royal Dutch Airlines) offer LPGs that do not specify any restrictions on price difference. Others explicitly state that their LPG offers are subject to a permitted price difference. For example, Delta Airlines established a refund condition that required a price difference of greater than $10. What are the effects of LPGs in various forms on customer evaluations and intentions? The literature on airline management does not address this issue and, thus, offers airline companies adopting such policies no evidence or advice.====This study aims to investigate how LPG terms (refund depth and refund conditions) influence customer perceptions and purchase intention on airlines’ own websites. Two customer perceptions—LPG believability (i.e., the extent to which a customer believes an LPG) and value—were included as mediators. Customer-perceived believability and value have been indicated as two key mediators of LPG design effects on customer behaviour (e.g., Kukar-Kinney and Walters, 2003).====This study contributes to existing research in several ways. First, it is the first in airline management research to investigate LPGs offered on airline websites. Increasing e-ticket purchases on an airline's own website is increasingly important for airlines because of lower distribution costs and closer relationships with its customers (Forgas et al., 2012; Wei and Ozok., 2005). From an academic perspective, understanding customer responses to LPGs on airlines' websites provides new insights into managing airlines' direct channels.====Second, this study addresses a previously unanswered question about what constitutes an effective LPG design on an airline website. We show that deep refunds increase customer purchase intention by increasing perceived LPG believability and value. Strict LPG refund conditions positively affect customer purchase intention by increasing perceived LPG believability. As customers are more susceptible to monetary incentives online than ever (Crespo-Almendros and Del Barrio-García, 2016), our results may help airline managers to make better decisions about how to design LPGs on their websites to enhance perceptions and purchase intention.====Third, this study extends airline promotion literature that has focused on sales promotions (e.g., Crespo-Almendros and Del Barrio-García, 2016) or frequent flyer promotions (e.g., Chang and Hung, 2013; De Boer and Gudmundsson, 2012; Park, 2010). From a managerial perspective, understanding the influences of LPGs on airline websites can aid airline companies in executing their promotional campaigns.","Lowest price guarantees on airline websites: Perceived believability, perceived value, and purchase intentions",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699717305392,March 2019,2019,Research Article,507.0

Given a list of flight requests, the company has to assign its aircraft to these requests while minimizing operational costs. The main issue in this planning process involves the positioning of aircraft when they are not available at the airports of customer departure. The cost of this positioning should be as low as possible, as the customers’ expenditures are proportional to the requested flight hours only. We propose a compact optimization model to support decision making in this situation. It takes into account the mandatory aircraft maintenance events and the possibility of flight upgrades according to the their impact on the operational costs. One important and novel feature of this model is that it allows the anticipation or postponement of the beginning of flights and maintenance events within a given tolerance, giving more freedom to the ====. This research is motivated by a case study carried out with a fractional management airline company that operates in European and Asian countries. Computational experiments using real-life data collected from the company show that the proposed model can be solved quickly using general-purpose optimization software, including open-source alternatives. The results indicate that the obtained solutions lead to significant reductions in the operational costs and hence can be used in practice for effective decision making.","The airline industry is well known for its complexity and costly activities. To operate efficiently, airline companies must plan their operations very carefully. They must rely on powerful information systems based on scientific methods to support decision making, including mathematical models and specialized algorithms (Klabjan, 2005; Van der Zwan et al., 2011). In the past few years, there has been a significant increase in on-demand air transportation services, mainly comprising air taxi and fractional ownership management companies (Yang et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2008; Van der Zwan et al., 2011). In contrast to the services offered by traditional commercial airlines (Lacasse-Guay et al., 2010), these companies are oriented to individual customers and do not offer flights with prefixed schedules. Customers impose their departure times and airports, and the company has to assign aircraft and crew to each customer request or to a group of them. The flights are point-to-point, are typically outside of hub airports and may be booked up to 4 h before departure. This leads to a more dynamic and unpredictable environment than that faced by standard commercial airlines.====One big challenge for companies that offer on-demand flights is determining routes that minimize aircraft positioning, which occurs when no suitable aircraft is promptly available at the airport to service a customer request. The cost of positioning flights is covered by the company, as they are not included as customer flying hours. This may incur a high extra cost, as customers pay proportionally to the flying hours corresponding to their requested flights. Typically, positioning may comprise 35% or more of the total flying time (Yao et al., 2008). Therefore, companies seek to optimize their aircraft routes in order to minimize the time spent on positioning flights. In addition, they may offer an upgrade for a customer request by assigning an aircraft of a better type than that required by the customer. This is done as long as the total operational costs are reduced, which is possible when the savings on positioning are larger than the extra costs of using a better (and more costly) aircraft to service a request.====Another important concern of these airline companies involves aircraft maintenance. Since the planning process is dynamic, companies use a short horizon that typically ranges from 48 to 72 h (Van der Zwan et al., 2011). This allows them to determine aircraft maintenance events in advance, and thus, they are pre-scheduled at the route planning process. In practice, it is usually possible to move the starting time of a pre-scheduled maintenance event to vary up to 24 h, either forward or backward in time. Hence, the planning process can use this freedom to determine more effective routes.====In this paper, we address the aircraft routing and scheduling problem that arises in the planning processes of on-demand air transportation services. This research has been motivated by a case study developed with a fractional ownership management company that operates in European and Asian countries. We propose an optimization model that supports decision making regarding aircraft routing, including aircraft maintenance events and service upgrades. The objective is to minimize the total operational cost of flights, which consists of aircraft positioning and extra costs due to upgrade. One important novelty of this model is that the starting times of flights and maintenance events can be anticipated/postponed to a given tolerance if they reduce operational costs. Computational experiments using real-life data show that this model can be solved quickly using general-purpose optimization software, including open-source alternatives. This is a desired feature in practice, as aircraft schedules typically change several times in a day for many different possible reasons, including the arrival of new requests, flight delays and airport congestion. Hence, the aircraft can be quickly rerouted using the model after these events. The model can be used to manage other types of per-aircraft on-demand aviation services, such as air taxis and other, more general types of personalized services.====Related aircraft routing and scheduling problems for on-demand air transportation have been addressed in the literature. Keskinocak and Tayur (1998) were the first to study the aircraft routing and scheduling problem. They developed an integer programming formulation for small and medium-sized problem instances and provided a heuristic algorithm for larger instances. Since then, many studies, most of which were motivated by real-life applications, have been presented in the literature. Most of them develop decision support systems based on Operations Research tools. Ronen (2000) presented a set partitioning-based method to solve the aircraft routing and scheduling problem. The proposed method combines feasible schedules for each available aircraft to generate a complete solution. The generation of schedules is performed by a heuristic algorithm controlled by a set of parameters to handle the number of feasible schedules that can be generated. Martin et al. (2003) modeled the problem with a flow-based integer programming formulation that can be solved by general-purpose optimization software. Espinoza et al. (2008a) proposed an multicommodity network flow formulation for the problem. They developed techniques to control the size of the network and to strengthen the linear programming relaxation of the model in order to effectively solve small-sized instances with general-purpose optimization software. Espinoza et al. (2008b) developed a local search scheme that was embedded within the core optimization technology of Espinoza et al. (2008a). The developed algorithm uses an integer programming model to explore large neighborhoods of the search space. Yang et al. (2008) proposed a solution method that couples an integer programming formulation and a heuristic algorithm. A general-purpose optimization software is used to solve the integer programs in the method. Additionally, the authors presented a set partitioning formulation and a branch-and-price algorithm to solve the problem. Yao et al. (2008) modeled the problem as a set partitioning formulation and used a rolling horizon approach to solve it. At each iteration of the approach, a column generation method was used to solve the resulting subproblem. Fagerholt et al. (2009) presented a method that uses a heuristic algorithm and simulation to support strategic decisions for a company planning to establish an air taxi service. The heuristic algorithm uses insertion operators to solve the problem and a local search stage for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, no paper in the literature addresses the possibility of anticipating or postponing the starting times of flights and maintenance events, as proposed in this paper.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the notation and provides the full description of a new optimization model that formulates the aircraft routing and scheduling problem addressed in this paper.

Because of the impact of quasi-fixed inputs, airports cannot immediately adjust their production processes. Based on the heterogeneity of public and private airports’ operation models, this study estimates their individual production adjustment speed and their short-run and long-run technical efficiencies to compare transnational airport business performance. The results reveal the differences in the production adjustment of airport groups under different ownerships and performance. Private airports have faster production adjustment, whereas public airports have higher short-run and long-run technical efficiencies. As their primary goal, public airports should strive to increase the elasticity of production adjustment to increase the production adjustment speed, thus improving their long-run technical efficiency. On the other hand, private airports should prioritize eliminating short-run inefficiency to increase their actual output level, thereby improving their long-run technical efficiency.","Globalization has expedited economic development worldwide. Air transport enterprises play a crucial role in a country's economic development. According to Airbus (2017), the global air traffic volume and revenue are expected to show more rapid growth in the next 15 years. Furthermore, from 2000 to 2015, the revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) worldwide has doubled. To increase the competitiveness of air transport enterprises, the civil aviation authority of each country has increased investment in infrastructure and has placed fewer restrictions on airports; these measures have provided more freedom to air transport enterprises. Establishing correct and effective operating strategies to increase operation efficiency and performance is a goal of airport operators, as well as a concern of the public and government authorities. The empirical results of this study on airports in different countries may serve as reference for airport authorities worldwide. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

The paper based on the prospect theory, taking the Beijing-Shanghai route as an example, constructs the passenger behavior choice model under flight delay, and in order to explore the decision-making behavior of passengers with different attributes under different delay scenarios. The results show that the reference point of passengers' behavioral decision-making is dynamic due to different delay scenarios and passengers' attributes. For the same reason, passengers have different behavioral choices when encountering flight delay. Through empirical analysis, it is found that the choice of passengers based on prospect theory is in line with the actual choice of passengers. The choice model proposed in the paper can effectively describe the passenger's choice behavior.","According to VariFlight's statistics on the punctuality rate of large airports in the world in 2017, Osaka Itami International Airport ranked first with 94.27%, and the average on-time punctuality rate of China's tens of millions of airports is 64.7%. The on-time punctuality rate of Urumchi Diwobao International Airport is only 75.37% which was the best in China's airports. It can be seen that the on-time punctuality rate of Chinese airports is still low. How to improve the on-time rate of passengers and the satisfaction of passengers after encountering flight delay is crucial to improving the travel experience of passengers. At present, in China, researches on flight delay mainly focus on issues such as service remediation, passenger satisfaction, and mass incidents. The choice of passengers after flight delay has not been involved. At the same time, in China, high-speed railways are developing rapidly. After the flight delay, considering the advantages of high-speed rail on time and comfort, transferring to high-speed rail has become a better choice for passengers.====In the authors' previous research (Jiang and Ren, 2018), the passenger's behavior choice will be different when the factors such as delay size, the time of inform passengers of flight delay information and the length of delay time are different. And passengers' trust in delay information and travel experience of passengers will affect the behavioral decisions of passengers. In other words, passengers' behavior choices will be different under the influence of passenger heterogeneity and delay scenario diversity. At the same time, authors also found that there was a difference in the maximum delay time that passengers can tolerate when flight delay scenarios was different and type of passengers was different in the first survey. In that survey, we collected 121 valid questionnaires. To further validate this view, authors conducted a field survey and another online survey, collecting 114 valid questionnaires and 212 valid questionnaires respectively. Through data of 447 valid questionnaires obtained by three surveys, it can be seen that when the length of informed delay time is the same, the maximum delay time that passengers can tolerate during large-scale delays is higher than that during small-scale delays. In the same delay scenario, the maximum delay time that leisure travelers can tolerate is higher that of business travelers can tolerate. Specific data are shown in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4. In addition, on the day of the airport field survey, many flights were delayed and many survey respondents were waiting for flights anxiously. According to the survey data, the endurance of the passengers surveyed in the airport field was generally lower than that of the passengers surveyed online. It can be seen that when the external environment changes, the maximum delay time that passengers can tolerate will also change.",Model of passenger behavior choice under flight delay based on dynamic reference point,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303168,March 2019,2019,Research Article,511.0

Airport performance areas, such as security, safety, and efficiency are usually studied separately from each other. However, operational decisions made by airport managers often impact several areas simultaneously. Current knowledge on how different performance areas are related to each other is limited. This paper contributes to filling this gap by identifying and quantifying relations and trade-offs between the detection performance of illegal items and the average queuing time at airport security checkpoints. These relations and trade-offs were analyzed by simulations with a cognitive agent model of airport security checkpoint operations. By simulation analysis a security checkpoint performance curve with three different regions was identified. Furthermore, the importance of focus on accuracy for a security operator is shown. The results of the simulation studies were related to empirical research at an existing regional airport.","Global air traffic passenger demand has been growing for the past eight years with an average annual rate of more than 5% per year, and is expected to grow in the future (IATA, 2016). This growing demand poses significant challenges for airports to continue operating in an effective, efficient, secure, and safe manner. A part of this difficulty comes from interdependencies and even conflicts between diverse performance goals of an airport, which sometimes cannot be satisfied all at the same time. For example, with increasing security threats modern airports need to ensure a thorough security check of all passengers. However, an extensive security check could also cause delays, inefficiencies, and disturbances in processing of flows of passengers, especially in busy periods.====In the field of air transport research, security and safety performance dimensions are usually studied separately from efficiency and capacity dimensions. Partly this is because safety and security risks have a different nature than capacity and efficiency measures (e.g., passenger queue length), which makes it difficult to identify relations between these performance areas. However, establishing and quantifying such relations, and identifying latent variables through which these areas are connected is essential for effective and well-grounded multi-criteria decision making concerning airport operations. This paper contributes to achieving this goal.====This paper focuses on operations of an airport security checkpoint, which involve both passenger checks and carry-on luggage checks. The performance of these operations is characterized along the security and efficiency dimensions. Security is measured by assessing incapability of the security checkpoint to detect illegal items, defined as the proportion of illegal items not confiscated at the security checkpoint. Illegal items comprise all items that are not allowed in the sterile area of the airport (TSA, 2018b). This list includes clearly dangerous objects, such as weapons and bombs, but also all kinds of daily used items, such as bottles of water or bandage scissors. Efficiency is estimated by the average queuing time of passengers.====The performance of the airport security checkpoint operations are largely influenced by performance of human operators (Kirschenbaum, 2015). In particular, research showed that “10% of security personnel exceeds or bends rules when the situation calls for it”, and “12% of security personnel states that breaking (security) protocol is sometimes necessary to get the job done” (BEMOSA, 2011). In many systems, fundamental, chronic goals tend to be sacrificed when an increasing pressure arises to achieve acute goals. Acute goals can be evaluated directly, while chronic goals can only be evaluated in the long run. Hoffman and Woods call this dichotomy of goals ==== (Hoffman and Woods, 2011). In the context of airport security, an operator makes trade-offs between secure operations (e.g., correctly identifying illegal objects) and timely and efficient operations (e.g., increasing passenger throughput). Furthermore, when security tasks are performed under time pressure, operators often need to handle the speed-accuracy trade-off (Fairbrother, 2010). The task of x-ray operators is to identify luggage that needs to be checked by the luggage check operators. If more time is taken to perform the task, it is likely to be performed more accurately. A comparable speed-accuracy trade-off applies to luggage and physical check operators and patrolling officers.====The central research question investigated in this paper is how local behaviour, decisions, and trade-offs of individual security operators influence the emergence of global, systemic security checkpoint performance curve relations and trade-offs in airport security checkpoint operations.====To model the local dynamics of security checkpoint operations, the multiagent system paradigm was employed (Gilbert, 2008; Adamatti, 2014). It is a suitable modelling tool to represent human and technical system components, and interaction between them, and to study emergence of system-wide properties from local dynamics of individual system components by simulation. Decision making of security operators was modelled using the Ratcliff Diffusion Model (Ratcliff and McKoon, 1998) and McCauley's Fatigue Model (McCauley, 2013), both of which are well recognized in the cognitive science field.====Based on the developed agent-based model, simulation experiments were performed, in which the local trade-off relations were varied for different types of security operators and groups of passengers. The simulation results consistently showed emergence of three different regions on the security checkpoint performance curve of the whole system. Furthermore, the importance of focus on accuracy for a security operator was demonstrated in this research.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 metrics for security checkpoint performance of airports are considered. Section 3 describes the agent-based model of security checkpoint operations. In Section 4 results of simulation experiments are discussed, and Section 6 concludes the paper.",Analyzing airport security checkpoint performance using cognitive agent models,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969971830190X,March 2019,2019,Research Article,512.0

Each airline maintains alliances simultaneously with a variable number of partners. The set of airline's alliance partners constitutes its alliance portfolio. A central theme of these portfolios is the way in which partner selection improve performance. Is the alliance portfolio configuration based on either similar or different partners? We examine how the differences can arise from differences between the partners themselves, from resource complementarity, and from the partners structural positions in the network. The relations between these types of differences and whether they affect firm performance are studied. Codeshare alliances established between airline companies at a global level are analyzed to establish their effects on performance. In particular, the study comprises 135 alliance portfolios all of which from major airlines. The results suggest that structural homogeneity and complementarity improve performance and that alliance portfolio diversity favors network resource complementarity.","The aim of a firm is to improve its performance and to prosper in the market. In the air transportation industry, demand may fluctuate widely due to uncontrollable environmental factors (seasons, security, geopolitical conditions …) (Min and Joo, 2016; Morrish and Hamilton, 2002). Thus, strategic alliance formation that promotes innovative management and the creation of new markets are essential factors here (Kim et al., 2013).====Strategic alliances are very relevant to air transportation companies and cooperation between airlines. Alliances have grown exponentially during the past decade, and they are now considered as a defining characteristic of this industry. Two specific forms of alliances may be highlighted that structure the sector: global alliances and codeshare arrangements. Many airline companies cooperate by forming alliances and building their network (Kim and Oh, 2004; Min and Joo, 2016; Morrish and Hamilton, 2002).====Airlines not only have to manage their bilateral agreements through this intense cooperative activity, but they have to focus on the set of agreements and alliances that they simultaneously maintain with all their partners. The airline's alliance portfolio is the set of its alliances (Hoffman, 2007; Lavie, 2007). The set of a focal firm's partners has to be jointly considered for appropriate alliance policy development (Hoffmann, 2007). Alliance portfolio configuration and management are turned into essential elements, because the firm may obtain the resources that it needs to gain a better competitive position and/or to improve its performance (Park and Cho, 1997; Wassmer, 2010). This study focuses on the configuration of alliance portfolios in the airline industry.====Alliance portfolio configuration means that firm resources are complemented or combined with those of its partners (Lavie, 2006; Mitsuhashi and Greve, 2009; Zheng et al., 2013). Therefore, it is not an issue about combining with each partner in an independent way, but about searching for an acceptable combination within the alliance portfolio members. For that reason, there will be a tendency to seek different partners with resources that differ from those of the focal firm. The choice of similar (homophily) or different (heterophily) partners is a traditional topic of research at the level of each individual alliance (Gulati, 1995). It is still a source of controversy (Ahuja et al., 2009; Kim and Higgins, 2007). There are arguments in favor of homophily, such as ease of learning, peer confidence, greater cohesion and social capital, shared knowledge, etc. However, they are contrasted with others associated with heterophily (e.g., greater access to resources, information variety, new market access or greater possibilities for innovation and similar development).====Network Theory has been used in acceptable analyses of alliances and the role of relational resources or network resources (Gulati, 2007). There are two levels of basic analysis in the study of networks (Zaheer et al., 2010). First, the analysis of the set of relations that a firm forms with its partners or its egonet. And second, the analysis of the questions relating to the global network in which the firm participates. The study of the configuration of the alliance portfolio has the egonet as the object of study (Ahuja et al., 2012; Ozcan and Eisenhardt, 2009).====The integrated combination of the set of firms that belongs to the airline's portfolio airline is relevant, rather than the way that an airline combines each one its partners independently to create the alliance portfolio and to manage it (Wassmer, 2010). An airline seeks alliance portfolio members that have sufficient resources to achieve its objectives. Each airline should examine whether it is better for its partners to be similar or different between each other. Moreover, each airline company should consider how similar or different its own resources should be with respect to those of the partner airlines.====Zaheer et al. (2010) pointed out that the effects at the egonet level on the firm performance arise from the connections of the ego firm, from the characteristics of the alters, and from the relations between the alters and the position of the ego within the whole network. Moreover, Kale and Singh (2009) considered that differences and complementarity in the resource endowment between the firm and its partners also affect performance. These previous contributions are included in this work, because they analyze the question of differences in the alliance portfolio configuration. On that basis, three dimensions are proposed that have not been clearly demarcated in the previous literature. First, diversity, that is concerned with the differences between the characteristics of the alters between each other. Second, there is structural homophily,==== which is centered on the differences in the positions of the ego and the alters within the whole network. Finally, there is complementarity, through which the differences in the ego firm's resource endowment and its alters are studied; differences that arise from the alliance portfolio configuration.====However, very little is known on how the different aforementioned dimensions may be combined to generate better firm performance. In the airline industry, the impact that alliance portfolio configurations with different partners and resources has on performance has received very little attention. Hence, there is a significant gap in the literature relating to an understanding of how these differences between the focal firm and its partners jointly affect focal firm performance.====Therefore, first aim is to deepen our comprehension of the dimensions that determine whether the alliance portfolio will tend towards homophily or towards heterophily (diversity, structural heterophily, and complementarity within the egonet). Moreover, we study whether these dimensions will influence performance and what that influence will be like.====Two types of alliances have grown substantially over the past couple of decades in the airline industry: codesharing arrangements and global alliances. Zou and Chen (2017) pointed out that codesharing arrangements are the most common type of airline alliance. Both types of alliance are related, because the bilateral agreements and the dyadic levels of codesharing arrangements force airlines to enter multilateral agreements at the level of global alliances. However, codesharing arrangements allow us to represent the alliance portfolio of an airline better than global alliances, because they include the relations between the global alliances and outside of them. Codeshare alliances have therefore been used to study the differences in the alliance portfolio configuration.====135 large airlines' alliance portfolios were analyzed to achieve our objective in this study. These companies represent 75% of the market in which almost all codeshare alliances are concentrated. The criteria for the selection of the airline industry were based in several reasons. First, because it is an industry in which it is easy to identify a relevant network or relational resource (destinations). Second, this industry has significant alliance activity. Finally, it is characterized by a type of standard agreement to facilitate the comparisons (codeshare) at the level of the alliance portfolio and the egonet.",Diversity in airline alliance portfolio configuration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699716304070,March 2019,2019,Research Article,514.0

Revenue management has then been widely used in air passenger managerial operations (Zou et al., 2013). Most passenger airlines adopt a differential pricing mode to sell their tickets. They set various ticket prices according to the booking time frames of passengers, for example, the earlier passengers booking tickets, the bigger discounts they are possible to get (Xiao et al., 2007).====With the application of revenue management concept in air passenger operations, it has also begun to be applied in air freight operations. At present, for many air freight transport companies, the operators always make their space prices according to the shipper types, such as large-scale forwarders, who buy the space by sighing contracts with air freight transport companies, and direct customers, who buy the space in the spot market. For the Large-scale forwarders, the prices are lower, that is because they are key customers of air freight transport companies with a long-term cooperative relationship between them. As such, large-scale forwarders take most spaces in the form of ‘pricing package’ every year. As a result, air transport companies always charge them at relatively lower prices to shift the risk of low space utilization (Moussawi-haidar, 2014). This is in contrast with direct customers, who are charged at higher prices to expect more profits with the remaining space in the spot market. For this pricing mode, one example is Xiamen Airlines in China. For its popular segments, Xiamen airlines allocates about 50 percent of the available space to its main customers at a lower price to ensure the stable revenue; another 30 percent of the available space is used to transport special or high-value cargos; and about 20 percent remaining available space is sold at a higher price for delivering cargos with value-added services. Besides the shipper types, air freight transport operators also take the cargo type factor into consideration in their pricing decision. They divide the cargos into general goods, fresh perishable goods and special goods. Normally, prices for general cargos are lower.====However, the application of revenue management in the spot market for air freight operations is still at the infant age (Huang and Chang, 2010). Most air freight transport carriers do not take the booking time into consideration for the space pricing, thus the single pricing mode is adopted in the spot market. It means, for the same flight, no matter when shippers book the space, the price remains the same. Carriers always adopt this mode mainly due to the significant random demand in the spot market. As such, it is difficult to predict booking demands in different sales periods. In addition, price changes by air freight transport carriers will be detected immediately by other competitive carriers (Alderighi, 2010) due to the transparent market information (Luo and Peng, 2007). It means competitors can adjust their pricing strategies if one carrier changes the space price in the competitive market. However, the single pricing mode has shortcomings and fails to maximize the revenue in the spot market.====The single pricing mode strategy may have the following shortcomings. Firstly, a single pricing mode neglects the fact that potential demands in the spot market at different sales periods are not the same. Secondly, this pricing mode ignores that the degrees of demand changes in response to space prices are different at different sales periods. Lastly, the single pricing mode may not match the relationship between booking demands and space supplies on segments with a supply shortage. As such, it is necessary for air freight transport carriers to apply the innovative pricing strategy for the limited space in the spot market. Similar to the air passenger industry, a differential pricing mode referring to different booking periods can be utilized to maximize freight revenues. This paper aims to optimize differential pricing strategies in the competitive spot market on a certain segment with two air freight transport carriers.====The paper is organised as follows. Following the introduction section, this paper conducts the literature review on space selling, pricing, and pricing and space allocation. Section 3 describes the research problem in detail. Section 4 establishes the pricing model to solve the problem. Section 5 designs an algorithm to solve the model. Section 6 conducts the empirical studies on a segment.

Since that time the focus on Gulf carrier business models has intensified, particularly from large US airlines Just as many sports are played on uneven terrain, so are many international businesses. In industries where geography and local conditions shape the outcome, a level playing field is unlikely, and comparative advantage will be an important element.====Rather than a neo-classical approach embodying perfect competition (Hunt and Morgan, 1995), adopting a comparative advantage approach to competition better explains what is happening in the airline industry. With geographically dispersed players subject to highly regulated ownership and market access conditions, the airline business operates in anything but perfect competition.====As Dubai climbs into the ranks of the world's busiest airports and the three large Gulf airlines expand their global networks, there is no question that Emirates Airline (Emirates), Etihad, and Qatar Airways have an impact on the industry. The question is whether their competitive advantage is found in their ownership structures or is derived from their ‘home ground’ location at the centre of major traffic flows, and an ability to leverage the rules of the game that were written in the 1940s.====This paper begins with a brief discussion of the country and firm level competitive forces that shape airline strategy, and of the concept of a level playing field in aviation.

We argue that the ‘subsidy’ classification is a distraction. Firstly, subsidies are quite difficult to define. Secondly, subsidies are little different in their economic effects to many other policy actions, and should be evaluated by policymakers similarly to these other measures. An economic approach would be to assess whether, in overall cost-benefit terms, a country is harmed by subsidies received by another country's airlines. Even if home airlines lose out, home passengers will gain, and the balance will often be positive. The paper outlines the circumstances under which a country would gain or lose from a subsidy to a foreign airline.","Claims about subsidies in international aviation have been made for many years. Originally, these took the crude form of e.g. statements that Gulf carriers ‘receive free fuel’. In recent years the controversy has been reopened and become very heated, and some of the claims require investigation.====The current dispute has centred on whether the US and the EU should allow airlines from outside these regions - notably, airlines based in the Persian Gulf - to compete for passengers in Western Europe and North America. The basis of the objection relates to subsidies allegedly received by the Gulf airlines.==== The objections rely on arguments and calculations contained in in-house research and consultancy work prepared for interested parties and in particular by airlines.==== This paper turns to the academic economics literature in order to evaluate the claims of subsidies and relies on an economics approach - an aggregate welfare or ‘total costs and benefits’ - to determine whether a country gains or loses if its competitors subsidise their airlines.====In this paper we argue, first, that subsidy claims are of marginal relevance to the airline competition debate, in part because it is not possible to rigorously identify what is, and what is not, a subsidy. But even if that distinction could be drawn, a subsidy's effects are comparable to those of other differences in airline operating environments. The American carriers that resist competition from the Gulf carriers object equally strongly to competition from certain new-entrant European airlines (e.g. Norwegian Air International) on the basis of alleged use of (cheaper) Asian staff. It is questionable whether the latter is a subsidy. However, a cash injection and a lower wage bill both reduce an airline's net costs so, in economic terms, there is no dividing line between them.====Even if a line could be drawn, the existence of subsidies would not necessarily require a policy response. Thus we reject the argument, widely canvassed by non-Gulf network carriers, that if it can be shown that Gulf airlines are in receipt of subsidies, nothing more needs to be demonstrated, and protection of US and European airline markets is warranted. Instead, we argue that it needs to be shown whether a country, such as the US, gains or loses in overall terms from a subsidy offered by another country, such as the UAE, to its airlines. So, even if home airlines lose as a result of the subsidy, home passengers, shippers and the home tourist industry gain.==== It is the overall effect of the subsidy that matters and, to determine that effect, an evaluation will be necessary.====The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 contains a brief literature review, describes the methodology by which the paper's research questions are analysed, and sets out the contribution of the paper.

This model associates service quality with individual behavioral and perception—brand awareness and perceived values and examines the buffering role of brand attractiveness and experience in the decision-making processes. In a sample of 451 passengers, somewhat as expected, airline service quality enhances the positive effect of repurchase intention on airline company service because it fosters a positive link between brand awareness and perceived value. Unsurprisingly, brand attractiveness and memorable brand experiences are found to strengthen the positive effect of brand awareness and perceived value. Several alternative models were used to check the robustness of our findings. Patterns of moderated mediation modeling for theoretical and empirical implications are discussed.","In recent years, the rapid growth and development of China's economy has driven the demand for airline transportation and the requirement of service quality. In other words, airline service in China is no longer solely for high-end business travelers but has gradually been adopted by the general public (Wang et al., 2018). According to statistics from the Civil Aeronautics Administration Ministry of Transportation and Communication, 549 million passengers were carried in 2017. China's growing airline industry is also facing various challenges because of multicorrelations and the replaceability of transportation systems; the industry faces internal competition from sources such as the domestic high-speed rail industry and external competition from international foreign airline companies (Wang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). By developing a competitive advantage, an airline company can significantly enhance their competitiveness while reducing the cost of tickets (Gerardi and Shapiro, 2009; Stavins, 2001), improving their relationships with travel agencies (Alamdari, 2002), participating in corporate social responsibility (Ringham and Miles, 2018; Upadhaya et al., 2018), and completing horizontal mergers to increase their own productivity (Yan et al., 2018). However, owing to the variability and uncertainty inherent in China's airline industry, its impact is unlikely to be straightforward and it may sometimes fail to meet intended expectations and passenger satisfaction goals (Chow, 2015). With such variability and uncertainty regarding requirements, most airline studies assert that “====” is the most important and foundational attribute for an airline company to create a competitive advantage (Chow, 2014; Gupta, 2017). Thus, there is a growing need to examine to what extent service quality is actually associated with passengers' requirements and why it might also succeed with regard to repurchase intention.====Moreover, some scholars have argued that in a highly competitive situation, service quality can incur intended positive consequences (Nadiri et al., 2008). For example, Wu et al. (2011) found that when consumers perceived the quality of service, this may result in influencing their behavior because of the positive awareness and image of the brand. Given that customers' requirements are the most difficult attribute to predict because of changing technology and service (Ringham and Miles, 2018), behavioral intention is likely to be one of the least predictable outcomes for service organizations (Chow, 2015). This is especially true because airline organizations often invest significant resources in identifying and predicting passengers' needs and behavioral intentions (e.g., Nadiri et al., 2008; Upadhaya et al., 2018). However, few scholars have produced an integrated mediation - moderation model and investigated whether and how airline service quality can produce both mediation and moderation consequences, such as brand equity improvement, perceived value and repurchase intention, simultaneously for China's airlines passengers.====The majority of past service-related research linking service quality to individual behavior has taken a cognitive approach to evaluating the critical attributes associated with self-service intention in order to form expectations about service quality (Dabholkar, 1996). Chen (2016) argued that airline companies improve service quality by transporting passengers to their destinations on time, and by providing a comfortable and safe experience. Providing these improves brand reputation and thereby facilitates purchase intention in the future. Therefore, researchers have pointed to the possibility that brand reputation and brand equity perception among customers may respond to service quality affectively as well (e.g., Cretu and Brodie, 2007; Wu et al., 2011). According to brand equity theory (Bamert and Wehrli, 2005), brand equity's objective is to have customers differentiate the services of one company from those of competitors, which can lead to a broad affective range during consumption and evaluation of a service's value. These service evaluations, in turn, influence the perceived value of a customers' experience and therefore their future purchase or visit intention. As such, airline passengers' brand equity evaluation may constitute a key mediating mechanism between service quality and perceived value estimates.====This study develops and empirically examines a mediation-moderation model of service quality that uniquely depicts China's airline passengers' perspectives as a central mechanism through which service is related to repurchase intention by perceived value and brand awareness of airline service. In particular, drawing upon brand equity theory (Bamert and Wehrli, 2005), this study suggests that service quality, appraised as a foundational attribute for airline passengers, provides a constant source of pleasant experiences, which then simultaneously promotes the potential accumulation of brand equity. In addition, this study also identifies two potentially important attributes that influence passengers' affective characteristics— brand attractiveness and a memorable brand—and explores their moderating role in the developing and highly competitive Chinese airline industry. Brand attractiveness is defined as the consumer's evaluation of a brand as satisfying their self-verification needs or matching their actual sense of self with the brand (Elbedweihy et al., 2016: 2904). Further, a memorable brand experience refers to customers' moods and state-dependent memory process about the brand (Morrin and Ratneshwar, 2003: 11). In other words, customers have a positive memory of a brand with a concomitant change in optimistic mood valence. Thus, brand attractiveness and a memorable brand experience are predicted to increase brand awareness of Chinese airline service by helping passengers to experience, detect, feel and enhance the quality of service and perceived value.====Against the background of increasing attention to Chinese airline industry growth, this study makes several contributions to the service and airline industry literature. First, this study builds on and extends service quality studies by highlighting the importance of other passengers' perspectives of airline brand equity accumulation. Second, this study is the first to introduce brand equity as an indirect driver of repurchase intention from a Chinese airline service perspective. Bamert and Wehrli (2005) asserted that perceived quality is a part of brand equity but do not consider the intervention of the mediating mechanism of brand awareness accumulation. Building on an integrated multiple mediation conceptual model, this study extends previous research by examining brand awareness as a mediator effect that links the relationships between service quality and perceived quality and value. Third, this study tests whether service quality is a second order attribute (i.e., tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy) that plays a dominant role in influencing passengers’ awareness of brand popularity and brand associations. Several alternative models were used to check the robustness of the findings of second order factor relationships between service quality and brand awareness. This novel investigation provides additional insights into the role of service quality as a significant predictor of brand awareness with multiple attribute settings. Finally, in contrast with previous empirical studies that focus on a single moderating or mediating effect of service quality (Chow, 2014; Dabholkar, 1996; Wu et al., 2011), this study uses the moderation-mediation models to consider both potential effects within Chinese airline service.

We argue that under an ==== market structure, strategic competition brought about by OSAs creates incentives to subsidize and/or protect domestic airlines. Such incentives are maintained or amplified by political lobbying efforts that bias ==== have been made more unlevel during the era of OSAs.","Since the early nineties, we have been witness to an unceasing evolution towards liberalization in civil air transportation, in particular through the negotiation of ‘open skies agreements’ (OSAs), which have allowed airlines of different nations reciprocal access to each other's markets. To the extent that such agreements represent a move to freer trade in air transport services, one might expect this trend to have resulted in a ‘leveling of the playing field’ through the elimination of subsidies and other mechanisms which advantage the airlines of one nation over those of other signatories to an OSA. However, recent disputes over unfair subsidies between the ‘big three’ US airlines (American, Delta, and United) and Gulf carriers have placed this issue in the spotlight and suggest that strategic protection may coexist with OSAs or may even be encouraged by such agreements. In this paper, we consider the relationship between OSAs and practices which confer asymmetric advantages to at least one airline of a signatory nation to an OSA.====The focus of our investigation is the USA which has signed no less than 120 ‘open skies’ agreements since 1992 with countries around the world.==== These OSAs replaced previously existing bilateral air service agreements which restricted the airlines that would be subject to reciprocal granting of market access rights and the extent of the market access rights being granted. In the latter case, pre-existing bilaterals were mostly limited to third and fourth freedom rights, while OSAs typically include fifth and sixth freedom rights.==== Table 1 shows the chronology of US-initiated OSAs from 1992 to 2015. Notable in the chronology is the OSA signed by the U.S. and the EU in 2007 which applies to all 27 EU states plus Norway and Iceland who joined the agreement in 2011.====The predominant characteristic of the United States’ OSAs is expanded and less restrictive reciprocal access to markets. Increased market access for US airlines (ceteris paribus) also generates the prospect of increased competition both in foreign and domestic markets. From a trade policy perspective, this is desirable because competition raises economic welfare with consumers as primary beneficiaries. Whether US airlines benefit from an OSA will depend on how well they can compete in these markets, but the results of such competition are also sensitive to any mechanism which can advantage one country's airlines over another's. That is, just as airlines are drawn into strategic competition through an OSA, potentially so are government agencies that have the ability to provide advantages to their domestic carriers.==== Failure by a government to provide its domestic carriers with a competitive advantage can be costly if foreign carriers receive such benefits from their own governments.====Of course, most trade liberalization agreements come with conditions regarding the prohibition of unfair subsidies or favouritism by any party along with a dispute settlement mechanism to identify and rectify any breach of the agreement. However, there are two important aspects of OSAs as distinct from other trade agreements; firstly, OSAs are not administered under the umbrella of the World Trade Organization and therefore do not operate under the WTO's dispute settlement process, nor do OSAs abide by the provisions of the general agreement on trade in services (GATS). Not having a ready-made and structured complaint and dispute process makes disputes costlier to initiate and administer. Secondly, while OSAs do contain some provisions on fair competition there are no explicit guidelines regarding what sort of subsidies, financial aid or other mechanisms and policies constitute a breach of the agreement.==== Article 11 of the USA's standard OSA provides a very general statement on ‘fair competition’;====In short, the OSAs pursued by the US over the last 25 years contain a great deal of flexibility with regard to what sorts of policies or actions can be allowed that might advantage the airlines of one signatory over those of another. This has led to ‘level playing field’ issues being raised; specifically accusations of subsidies and unfair competition have been leveled at various nations with some regularity during the OSA era, with a significant number of emanating from the USA. Most recently, in 2015 an organization called the ‘Partnership for Open and Fair Skies’, representing the three major US air carriers (Delta Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines) published a white paper which accused the three Persian Gulf carriers (Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways) of unfair competition due to excessive state aid.==== At the time of writing, these US carriers and their alliance partners continue to call for renegotiations of the US-United Arab Emirates and the US-Qatar OSAs. For their part, the Gulf carriers have launched their own counter-accusations of subsidies and anticompetitive practices in the US.====Another recent example of ‘unlevel playing field’ complaints has been the accusation of unfair competition due to ‘flag of convenience’ behaviour (Mendelsohn, 2014) by EU-based carrier Norwegian Air International (NAI) which was accused by a number of US airline labour groups and the same ‘big three’ US airlines (CAPA, 2015c, 2015d). It took Us DoT three years to issue NAI's foreign carrier permit (CAPA, 2016).====If the objective of U.S. open skies agreements is the equality of opportunity (market access) as articulated in the preamble of the Chicago Convention, then many of the arguments used in these ‘playing field’ disputes are irrelevant according to De Wit (2014) and CAPA (2016). Equality of opportunity does not guarantee equality of outcome, as Gillen et al. (2002) demonstrate in measuring the liberalization effects of the Japan-Canada air transport market. Tretheway and Andruilaitis (2015) as well as De Wit (2013) underline that a perfectly level playing field did not exist prior to the era of OSAs and in fact has never existed in international air transport markets due to Ricardian rents of geographical advantages (for example, hub location in relation to international air traffic flows) and Schumpeterian rents (for example, a substantial A380 fleet). The legitimate existence of economic rents and the widely differing circumstances of nations and their aviation sectors (including such fundamental issues as state ownership, policies on airport development, taxation, labour regulation, bankruptcy and health insurance) explain why a commonly accepted definition of what a level playing field in aviation means is absent (International Civil Aviation Organization, 2013). With no commonly adhered to definition of what ‘level playing field’ means, we are thus left to consider whether the era of OSAs has led to a more level playing field than existed previously. In this paper, we will argue that while OSA's provide reciprocal market access which stimulates air travel and market growth, they also lead to strategic competition which provides each nation signatory with an incentive to create or maintain policies or programs which advantage their own domestic airlines. Such incentives are amplified when national policy decisions regarding civil aviation are subject to a producer surplus bias wherein the interests and profits airlines receive more weight than consumer surplus in the assessment of total welfare.====We proceed in section 2 by reviewing the literature on the liberalization of air transport and on strategic trade policy. In section 3, we outline a theoretical model in which expanded access to markets via an OSA can lead to increased state level subsidies that advantage domestic airlines faced with foreign competition. We then report on the existence of state level subsidies in the US. In section 4, we broaden the analysis to consider the role of special interest group influence and the possibility of a bias towards producer surplus in civil aviation policies and programs and in support of this view we present a brief review of the literature on trade protection and policy formulation. In section 5 we report on three examples of programs and policies in the US which have advantaged US carriers during the ‘open skies’ era; debt restructuring, the CRAF/Fly America program and antitrust immunity. We offer a brief conclusion in section 6.",US open skies agreements and unlevel playing fields,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303909,January 2019,2019,Research Article,520.0

Results show that the operator and the government are the main influencers of safety performance in the air transport of dangerous goods. The total process safety is emphasized. The findings facilitate the prevention of accidents and unsafe incidents when transporting dangerous goods via air.","Since the continuous growth of China's economy and foreign trade, the market for the air transport of dangerous goods has developed rapidly for over a decade. The increasing volume and type of dangerous goods threatens air safety and poses great risks to the public (Zheng, 2014). Dangerous goods (DG), including explosive, flammable, toxic, radioactive, corrosive, and other characteristic substances, can cause serious personal injury, property damage, and environmental pollution if not properly handled (Julio and Liliana, 2016). Compared with roads and railways, air transport is more often international, and transported goods are of higher universal value. Therefore, the impact scope of air accidents and incidents involving dangerous goods becomes greater, and the consequences turn out much worse. Therefore, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and all state government are highly concerned about how to improve the safety performance of dangerous goods shipped via air.====Safety management and risk assessment of dangerous goods transport is also an area of significant scholarly interest. In the relevant literature, some research has been carried out on road, railway and marine transport, and few studies have examined the air transport of dangerous goods. Moreover, previous research has focused largely on the investigation or analysis of accidents and unsafe incidents (Fabiano et al., 2002; Joanne, 2011; Nijole and Aldona, 2014). A literature review found little on safety management from a prevention perspective. Safety management system (SMS) is becoming increasingly popular with global governments and air enterprises (Wenshi and Jing, 2016). The most crucial part of SMS is identifying safety performance indicators (SPIs) before occurrence of accidents and incidents for monitoring potential risks and setting the foundation of mitigating potential risk and formulating control measures. Thus, the identification of SPIs of dangerous goods in the air transportation chain warrants further study.====Many participants are involved in the air transportation of dangerous goods, including shippers and their agents, operators and their agents, and government supervisors. The safety of air transport depends on the reliability and safety contributions of these participants. At present, the identification and summarization of SPIs from these parties is not comprehensive enough (Yu-Hern et al., 2006; Wen-Kai et al., 2016). Moreover, the parties who mainly influence safety performance when shipping dangerous goods across the industry have yet to be identified. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on determining and prioritizing SPIs pertaining to dangerous goods shipped by air in China. The relationship between the three aforementioned parties is also examined to highlight the most important influencer.

The IROPs is being newly defined, and guidelines for establishing a response system are being proposed in the U.S. and the U.K. However, studies in relation to preemptive and predictive responses aimed at minimizing the negative impacts, such as to analyze ripple effects generated after an incident, have not been sufficiently conducted. Accordingly, this study was conducted to analyze the ripple effects of IROPs according to severity and duration time, and to thus suggest a methodology to enable predictive response. The situation of IROPs was simulated and analyzed using the tower log data of 2015 from Jeju International Airport (CJU), Gimpo International Airport (GMP), and Gimhae International Airport (PUS) in Korea. The five-level classification for IROPs was then suggested using the K-means algorithm. The methodology suggested was verified for applicability to actual airport operation through scenario analysis. It is expected to serve as a framework for establishing the quantitative standards for goal setting with which airport operators solve the situation of IROPs.","The demand for air transportation in Korea has been increasing rapidly in the last five years, by an annual average of 7.5% for domestic and 9.6% for international flights, and people's expectations for air transportation service are also rising. In addition, airport operation systems are becoming more advanced and complex as a result of the promotion of smart airport systems, etc. Failure to respond to irregular operations (IROPs) appropriately in the initial phase of the incident can cause considerable inconvenience and confusion, and accordingly the concern regarding negative impacts, such as for losses due to delayed or canceled flights, is rising. In January 2016, Korea experienced a chaotic situation as around 170,000 people were crowded in Incheon International Airport, the largest on record, due to an extensive baggage delay caused by insufficient initial handling of the overload in the baggage handling system. In addition, temporary shut-downs at Jeju International Airport (CJU) occur frequently due to the impacts of bad weather, such as heavy snow in the winter, leading to the issue continuously being raised regarding establishment of a response system for irregular airport operation.====As consideration is given to continuous growth of air transportation demand and consumer-centric air transportation policy, irregular airport operation is being newly defined, and efforts for the establishment of a response system are being made as well. The U.S. and the U.K. conducted studies in relation to IROPs under the supervision of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), motivated by incidents of large-scale passenger transportation delays and flight cancellations caused by delayed processing from runway and airport system errors. ACRP (2012) provides a comprehensive response manual, and is emphasizing the importance of continuous development, evaluation, and advancement. In a subsequent study, emphasis was placed on the importance of restoring key functions, and a logical framework was provided for determining and assessing the order of priority for restoration of different functions and procedures (ACRP, 2013). MCR Federal, LLC and Critical Path, Inc. (2014) developed an analytical approach to investment evaluation for reducing the negative impacts of irregular airport operation.====Most airports in the U.S. have prepared IROPs contingency plans pursuant to section 42301 of the FAA modernization and reform act of 2012. DFW Airport (2013) defined IROPs as the events which exert negative impacts on optimal flight schedules and normal passenger flows. In addition to making efforts for sharing information with the stakeholders and local partners, it distinguishes and includes the situations of normal, irregular, and emergency operations in the manual. CAA of the U.K. specified “guaranteeing of continuous airport operation to improve the value to passengers while they are in an airport, and especially during a disruption” as a condition for operation license for Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport (Steer Davies Gleave, 2014). These references suggest guidelines in an expanded concept including the irregular operations in addition to emergency plans, and propose improvement directions for response plans by emphasizing swift airport operation recovery and seamless operation after an incident. Nevertheless, there are limitations in terms of quantitative analysis and predictive response to the ripple effects generated by an incident. Research on the impact of IROPs has been diverse, and has emphasized the importance of managing IROPs. Pejovic et al. (2009) estimated the delay cost for disruption at Heathrow airport using a case study of a hypothetical closure. Miller (2011) analyzed passenger experience through questionnaires during the closure of the UK's airspace because of the ash emitted from the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull. Lordan et al. (2014) suggested a methodology to detect the critical airports in the global air transport network through a simulation of airport isolation using an adaptive strategy of node selection. Voltes-Dorta et al. (2017) analyzed the vulnerability of the European air transport network to major airport closures by measuring the aggregate delays imposed on the disrupted passengers using a market information data transfer dataset. However, there has not been enough study regarding the proactive and systemic identification of IROPs from the perspective of airport operation itself.====In Korea, serious situations that can lead to human casualties, such as aircraft accidents, natural disasters, and fires in facilities, are divided into nine emergency situations according to the ICAO and domestic regulations. However, the regulations do not include cases other than an emergency situation where airport function deteriorates as a result of the failure of individual functions, such as baggage handling. The studies to analyze ripple effects following an IROP and to establish the response system have also not been conducted sufficiently in Korea. The failure of individual functions can lead to considerable inconvenience for airport users or a serious accident. In addition, as the airport system becomes complex, a range of IROPs can occur unexpectedly. In this regard, this study proposed a methodology to predict the negative ripple effects of an irregular airport operation and quantitative standards for classifying irregular operations according to their severity and duration. Fig. 1 shows the classification concept of IROP in this study. Through a scenario analysis, the applicability of the methodology and standards was verified, and it is anticipated that the result of this study will be utilized as a basic frame in introducing the related policies and systems in the future.",Identification model development for proactive response on irregular operations (IROPs),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718302151,March 2019,2019,Research Article,522.0

To achieve these aims it was conducted a semi-structured interview with the airport's branding manager and a questionnaire with the passengers (n = 92). The findings showed that the airport's new management company has been employing tourist branding strategies using a mix of elements, but it is possible that these actions have had the main objective of raising the airport to international service standards, whereby the operation of terminals by large companies is a trend. It was also concluded that some of the airport branding elements (i.e. logos and slogans) are well developed and represent a higher impact on passenger experience, while others (i.e. retail ==== strategies) require further attention and new approaches in order to improve passenger experience in the terminal.","Tourism is closely linked to transportation. According to Lamb and Davidson (1996), transportation is one of the three fundamental components of tourism, the other two being the tourism product (supply) and the tourism market (demand, or the tourists themselves). Technological innovations in means of transport have been key to the evolution of tourism, with air transport being perhaps the main contributor to the development of tourism in the world (Lohmann et al., 2013; Lohmann & Panosso Netto, 2012).====Because of the growing competition among airports for travelers and cargo, airport managers realize the need to invest in innovative and more focused marketing strategies. One of the differentiation strategies adopted by airports is branding. Although this concept is widely discussed in the airport marketing arena, academic studies of airport branding are still rare. Some noteworthy examples of research in this area are the works of Tse (2009) and Castro (2015). The former, an MBA thesis from the University of Calgary, examined the branding of Canadian airports, while the latter, a doctoral thesis from Rio de Janeiro Federal University, investigated airport branding as a tool to promote tourist destinations.====Tom Jobim International Airport - RIOgaleão is the gateway to the city of Rio de Janeiro and one of the main airports in Brazil in terms of passengers handled. In April 2014, the expansion, maintenance and operation of the airport were the subject of a privatization auction, and the winning bidder was Consórcio Aeroportos do Futuro, a consortium formed by the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht and the airport operator Changi Airports International from Singapore, acquiring a 51% stake, while Infraero, the Brazilian government's airport operating company, retained 49% (RIOgaleão, n.d.). Odebrecht sought to sell its share in 2017 following its implication in a corruption scandal involving the Brazilian government. China's HNA Infrastructure announced that it had acquired control of the airport management company, but it was unable to obtain the requisite authorization from the Chinese government in a timely manner. Thus, all private participation in the airport was ultimately held by Changi Airports (Rittner, 2017). The new management team adopted a commercial vision with a more diversified outlook, treating passengers as customers rather than mere airport users. Thus, the new airport management strives constantly to identify the needs and expectations of customers so they will have pleasant and memorable experiences (Halpern and Graham, 2013).====The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of RIOgaleão's branding strategies on the passenger experience, recognizing that the airport is an important part of the overall tourist experience. The results are relevant both for airport managers and scholars interested in the topic, since these branding strategies can help to promote a more diversified portfolio of customers and products/services, thereby attracting new investments and companies, generating employment and increasing the flow of tourists to Rio and to Brazil as a whole. These outcomes in turn will substantiate the academic literature regarding the role of airports in tourism.====This paper is organized as follows. First, we present concepts from existing literature regarding the branding of airports as it relates to the tourist experience. Following this literature review, we present and discuss the results obtained and then provide our final considerations.","Passengers perceptions of airport branding strategies: The case of Tom Jobim International Airport – RIOgaleão, Brazil",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699717305550,January 2019,2019,Research Article,523.0

It is thus important for planners and stakeholders to understand the changes in the global aviation network. This study investigates the global aviation network, taking 10 years worth's OAG data from the years 2006–2015 and examines whether a spatial dispersal trend dominates the development of the ====. It considers the aviation network at the airport level, and the airport–city level, which may consist of one or more airports. After clarification of the various definitions of concentration, we find that there appears a trend toward a dispersal pattern in the global aviation network at the airport level. On the other hand, there appears a slight concentration at the airport–city level. Besides, there have been some major capacity expansions at airports in the Middle East and East Asia, while the capacities of some traditional hubs in Europe and North America have become increasingly constrained since the 2008 global financial crisis. Furthermore, our study provides further observations consistent with the phenomenon of bypassing of traditional hubs, especially mega-hubs. Competition for passengers among hubs and secondary airports, especially in multi-airport cities, is discussed.","The airline industry has been growing steadily for decades. Air traffic is expected to maintain an annual growth rate of 4.6–4.9% in the next 20 years (Airbus, 2015, p. 14; Boeing, 2015, p. 23), implying a doubling of traffic volume in 15 years. The development of the aviation business and accessibility to air travel services have long-established interactions with the regional economy (e.g., Zhang, 2012; IATA, 2016). For example, Bel and Fageda (2008) found that a 10% growth in intercontinental destinations accessible by air transport led to a 4% growth in business headquarters in the corresponding European urban areas. Matsumoto et al. (2016) have shown that business connectivity had more influence on the level of international air passenger flows within East Asia than other variables such as GDP per capita, population, and distance between cities. After literature surveys, Fu et al. (2010) and Zhang et al. (2011) also concluded that the air transport liberalisation has led to substantial traffic and economic growth. Understanding the evolution of air travel network helps stakeholders to make better decisions when planning future aviation developments. In particular, these stakeholders like regional or international hubs need to understand their positions and the network changes in global aviation.====Changes in policy, fluctuations in the economic environment, and oscillations of managerial trends in business contribute to the evolution of aviation network through the launching and curtailing of routes, changes in traffic volumes on existing routes, and alterations in the dependency of certain hubs. Prior to the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, the airline network in the United States (US), and more generally global air travel, were largely a “point to point” system. Many studies in the early 2000s, however, concluded that the “hub and spoke” network system dominated the airline industry in the 1980s and 1990s, especially for the US domestic air travel (e.g., Reynolds-Feighan, 2001; Button, 2002). The hub-and-spoke networks were regarded as helping airlines to minimise costs, improve service quality, gain strategic advantages in airline rivalry, and facilitate alliance partnership (e.g., Brueckner et al., 1992; Hendricks et al., 1995; Oum et al., 1995; Oum and Zhang, 2001). This network strategy created a pattern of traffic concentration, with over 15 major hubs emerging in the US and Europe (e.g., Goetz and Sutton, 1997; Reynolds-Feighan, 2001). Similar hubbing strategies also dominated aviation developments in Southeast Asia between 1979 and 1997 (Bowen, 2000).====Later studies nevertheless suggest a more mixed outlook, or even a dispersal trend in global air travel. Using data from 1990 to 2000, O'Connor (2003) analyzed the shifting concentration of air transport connectivity across the world city hierarchy. Global air travel showed a de-concentration tendency, with a shift of passenger traffic volume “away from very large cities toward those next in rank” (O'Connor, 2003, p. 91), both within the world's top-100 airports and among the top-tier “globalised and world cities” (GaWC, a classification of cities to be described in more details in Section 4 below). Similarly, Burghouwt and Hakfoort (2001) and Burghouwt (2007) found that, although the intercontinental seat capacity of European airlines was still concentrated in a few large hub airports, intra-European traffic showed a de-concentration pattern due to the growth of regional and low-cost carriers (LCCs). Other studies have shown that as LCCs expanded their services, they tended to spread their capacity and routes more evenly across non-traditional hubs in their networks (Reynolds-Feighan, 2010; Suau-Sanchez and Burghouwt, 2011). Bel and Fageda (2008) and Suau-Sanchez and Burghouwt (2011) also observed a de-concentration trend in intercontinental seat capacity in Europe during recent years.====This paper, we show that the spatial dispersal trend in global air transport has appeared to enter a new phase. Spatial dispersal has long been studied in urban development (Sinclair-Smith and Turok, 2012; Vasanen, 2009). In our context, a specific effect of spatial dispersal is de-concentration, which refers to the spreading of air traffic away from major hubs toward the next-sized airports (O'Connor 2003). The concepts of spatial dispersal and de-concentration are interrelated from the perspective of economic geography and airport competition. Spatial dispersal relates to the air travel spread on the global aviation network, which may due to changes in airport developments, airlines' route development strategies, and the travel patterns of passengers by region. De-concentration relates to changes in the airport's operating environment, such as government aviation policy, airport competition, capacity constraints at major hubs, and the expansion of low-cost airline networks.====The studies reviewed above mainly examined the data up to the 2000s; however, several “game changing” events have occurred in the airline industry in the past 10 years (2006–2015). These events include the roller-coaster ride of jet fuel prices (rising to a historical peak in 2008, then falling to one third of the peak, and now back to about half of the peak), the expansion of LCCs around the world (Gross et al., 2013), the mergers of major legacy carriers (e.g., Delta-Northwest, Lufthansa-Swiss International, United-Continental, and American-USAir), and the partial or complete abandonment of a hub by its dominant carrier, an act known as “dehubbing.” According to Redondi et al. (2012), 37 airports around the world were dehubbed between 1997 and 2009, including Barcelona by Iberia, London Gatwick by British Airways, and Milan Malpensa by Alitalia (Burghouwt, 2014; see Wei and Grubesic, 2015, for a recent case in the US). The impact of the regional economy, changes in the structure of airlines, and the performance of airports, especially international hubs, are all strongly correlated with the evolution of global air travel network. Rimmer (2000) studied the effects of the Asian financial crisis on Southeast Asia's air traffic, where there was a shift in the emphasis on route development. Dobruszkes and Van Hamme (2011) used the carriers' routes and seats (passenger capacity) data (2003–2010) to study the effect of the economic crisis on air traffic volumes and discussed the impact on different continents' air services. Yet, these studies did not examine whether airport travel has become more concentrated or dispersed in the past decade.====The objective of this study is to investigate whether the spatial dispersal trend continued with the aforementioned major events and changes by studying a global dataset from 2006 to 2015. This paper is organised as follows: The data collection method is described in Section 2, followed by preliminary findings on the global aviation network. Section 3 presents the main empirical results on network dispersal at the airport level, while the “hub bypassing” issue is discussed in Section 4, focusing on the network concentration at the level of a city that may consist of multiple airports. Finally, Section 5 contains concluding remarks.",Is spatial dispersal the dominant trend in air transport development?

We use a “gravity” model to show that improvements in measures contained in the Global Express Association's Customs Capability Database can significantly increase trade flows: introducing a single measure could facilitate a 5% increase in trade flows. Roughly half this effect is transmitted through the channel of international express delivery by air, because express delivery acts as facilitator of wider trade. The effect is likened to the impact of the telegraph on transatlantic shipping in the 19th Century.","Much of the literature relating to the impact of aviation on the wider economy focusses on the role of passenger aviation, either as a provider of direct, indirect or induced employment or as a catalytic facilitator of economic activities in the sectors that make use of air transport (for instance, debates around the need for additional runway capacity in the South East of England, see Airports Commission, 2015). This paper focusses on the contribution that air freight, and specifically international ==== delivery, makes to international trade.====International express delivery is supported by complex logistics chains for transporting and consolidating items sent by individual shippers. The international leg of most deliveries is provided by air transport. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.====According to the GEA (Global Express Association, 2015), its member companies operate some 1700 aircraft. At June 2016 the largest express carrier, FedEx Express directly operated a fleet of almost 660 dedicated freighter aircraft of which almost 400 are large jets.====As well as dedicated freighter aircraft, international express carriers also make extensive use of bellyhold freight capacity on scheduled passenger services, which can play an important role in the financial; support of passenger routes.====Unlike passenger air services, because of the flexibility of their model and the use of dedicated cargo hubs, airport capacity is not the same constraint on the growth of air cargo as it is on passenger services. Rather, there is a focus in these businesses on the efficiency of their logistics networks. This is particularly true for express delivery, where the ability to expedite deliveries through official inbound and outbound clearance processes is central to the carriers’ ability to offer timed delivery services. With this in mind, our paper seeks to explore the impact of these processes on trade.====Clearly both the volume and value of goods that are carried by international express delivery is small in comparison to the total international trade in goods and services. Companies generally use express delivery services because they are transporting goods where speed, reliability transparency and security are particularly important. Goods transported in this way are typically high value, low weight/volume items including high-tech components, perishables, groceries and pharmaceuticals that cannot afford to be held in transit, production samples and essential documents. International express delivery is also becoming increasingly important for B2C e-commerce operations.====The focus of our study is not just to consider the parochial impact of border processes on express carriers but also to use this information to cast light on the contribution that international express delivery has as a facilitator of trade more widely.====The starting point for our approach is to consider new measures of the efficiency of border processes - particularly impacting on international express delivery - and their effect on trade more widely. Having identified that effect we ask whether this effect can be used to isolate in any way the specific facilitation impact that international express delivery may have on trade in general.",The influence of customs capabilities and express delivery on trade flows,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303934,January 2019,2019,Research Article,525.0

US airlines have used Chapter 11 to restructure their operations. This has been criticized as a subsidy by major non US airlines and governments for a long time and recently, in the “level playing field” debate. Applying legal and economic perspectives of subsidy, we examine the different opportunities of Chapter 11 to reduce airlines’ costs. It is argued that most of the forms available, such as the modification of ====, do not constitute a subsidy. Only the termination of pension plans might involve a subsidy, but only using a legal definition of doubtful relevance since there is normally no use of public funds.","In the US, bankruptcy protection is regulated under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Law. This mechanism, which allows firms to organize and restructure, has been employed by all major US network carriers in the past (as well as by thousands of other firms from every segment of the US economy). This process has been criticized as it allows potentially inefficient firms to reorganize (Hotchkiss, 1995), and that the outcome may be such that firms, or industries, will be left with chronic inefficiencies (Jensen, 1991). An example occurs with the US airline industry, which has experienced recurring filings for bankruptcy protection.====Major concerns have been expressed that Chapter 11 can be perceived as a form of a subsidy, which ultimately distorts the level playing field in domestic and especially international markets. In this paper, we concentrate on the latter. Existing studies (see overview by Tretheway and Andriulaitis, 2015) identify various factors that could tilt the level playing field in aviation. Subsidies play a major role in this regard, however bankruptcy protection laws, like Chapter 11, are not addressed.====In the discussion of aviation, it is often claimed that Chapter 11 involves a subsidy to US airlines. Chapter 11 has been characterised by IATA Vision 2050 (2010) as a market distorting subsidy and as an obstacle to raise the profitability to a normal level. The European and US delegations also disagreed on Chapter 11 in their negotiations for an Open Sky Area. However, the most recent, and most controversial, subsidy claim has been made by the Gulf airlines (Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways) in their response to the US airlines, which had argued that the Gulf countries subsidised their airlines, and thus there was not a “level playing field”. The Gulf airlines responded by arguing that the US airlines were subsidised in several ways, including through Chapter 11.====This paper sheds light on the question as to whether Chapter 11 involves a subsidy or not from legal and economic points of view. In order to decide if Chapter 11 should be regarded as providing an avenue for subsidy, we analyse, firstly, the bankruptcy laws and regulations of the ==== (U.S.C.) and identify the core opportunities which companies under Chapter 11 can use to avoid liquidation. Secondly, we define and compare the different legal and economic concepts of subsidies. Next, we consider the different ways in which Chapter 11 allows an airline to restructure its business and reduce its costs, and assess whether these involve subsidies.==== The analysis is then applied to two cases: the US-EU open skies area negotiations, as well as the ongoing “level playing field” dispute between the US and the Gulf airlines. In summary, we argue that there is no clearly relevant legal definition under which Chapter 11 involves a subsidy, and that Chapter 11 does not involve a subsidy under normal economic definitions of the term.",Chapter 11 and the level playing field: Should chapter 11 be considered as a subsidy?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303910,January 2019,2019,Research Article,526.0

It paints a brief portrait of the history of regulation and deregulation in aviation and the role of competition policy in a liberalised aviation marketplace. It then focuses on the level playing field, which is often used to argue for protectionist policies and ownership restrictions on air carriers. The paper suggests that some of the controls on market access in place today may do more harm to consumers and the broader economy than good.","The air transport industry exists within one of the most elaborate and complex economic regulatory ecosystem amongst major, civilian sectors of the economy. The intricate and interlinked webs of air services agreement, their ebb and flow between a regulated and deregulated environment, the limitations placed on foreign capital and the quest for an undefined but lofty level playing field are all elements which make the economic regulation of aviation rather unique. This is particularly striking, as aviation does not possess singular economic characteristics that would suggest the need for this special treatment. (see Table 1)====In spite, or because, of this complex system, aviation today is thriving. In 2015 over 3.5 billion passengers and 200 billion tonnes of cargo travelled by air, both all-time highs (ICAO, 2016). International air transport carried 50 percent of international tourists and 35 percent of the value of world trade. Airlines are expected to report a combined profit of $36 billion USD in 2016 according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a record high, and experience 19 fatal accidents resulting in 325 fatalities, the second lowest since the dawn of the jet age. These statistics clearly show that the system, as it exists today, is working very well, but the question remains as to whether it can work better.====The ITF created a working group on aviation liberalisation in 2015 and produced a research report on the issue, which should be published in 2017. The following paper summarises and expands upon some of the findings from the report and looks at areas where we have yet achieved a truly liberalised environment. It is organised in five sections. The first section presents an abridged history of a century of economic regulation in aviation to explain the system of bilateral air services agreements (ASAs) that we witness today. The second section discusses the challenges of maintaining a competitive environment within a deregulated marketplace. The next two sections look at very specific issues touching aviation today, namely what constitutes a level playing field and the restrictions over foreign ownership and control of an air carrier. The paper concludes in the last section with some thoughts on how to improve economic regulation in aviation as aviation shifts away from regulated supply management to a liberalised environment where competition policies and laws provide the framework for how carriers compete and cooperate with each other.",Aviation liberalisation: What headwinds do we still face?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718303892,January 2019,2019,Research Article,527.0
