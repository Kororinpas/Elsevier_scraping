While numerous existing studies analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among developed states, little is known about its effects on people’s lives and social discrepancies in emerging economies. To this end, we empirically analyze the 2020 Indonesian Labor Force Survey data, hypothesizing that COVID-19 has given idiosyncratic risks and impacts on people by gender, age, education, occupation and regions. We find that income loss and job loss are prominent among males, younger and less educated people as well as among self-employed and part-time non-agricultural workers. These tendencies are not pronounced for people enjoying high income and mobility, but tend to be evident for urban residents and those having dependents. Notably, self-employed people have the highest risk of losing income, while part-time urban workers face the highest probability of losing their jobs. The propensity score matching method also demonstrates that these losses are most evident for the regions susceptible to COVID-19. Overall, we suggest that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups require additional support to strengthen their resilience in the face of exogenous shocks, such as the one caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.","Socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been devastating. According to ====, 114 million jobs were lost in 2020 as compared to 2019. Consequently, the number of unemployed increased by 33 million globally. Furthermore, over the same period of time, global labor income declined by ====, amounting to ==== of the global gross domestic product (GDP). On top of these grave overall impacts, some employment cohorts have suffered disproportionate damage. For example, ==== or 1.6 billion of informal workers around the world lost ==== of their income (====). Their situation has been exacerbated by the virtually absent access to social security funds. Against this background, our paper addresses the issue of the COVID-19 impact on the well-being among developing countries’ citizens, concentrating on whether or not the existing socioeconomic discrepancies have widened.====A salient feature of the ongoing pandemic is the deepening of the existing socioeconomic inequalities. One of the major dividing lines in the context of the COVID-inflicted loss runs through occupational sectors and employment types. Being the case of an exogenous economic shock, COVID-19 has jeopardized low-skill and non-regular labor (====). The former group has higher chances of being displaced due to automation processes, while the latter has weaker legal protection compared to regular workers, being subject to layoffs as part of corporate optimization plans. On top of that, self-employed tend to suffer from the negative income adjustments, since their profits are particularly susceptible to demand fluctuations (====). Hence, depressed consumer activity during the pandemic period has led to lower profits accruing to private entrepreneurs. ==== provide evidence of service and manufacturing workers in the developing countries being most heavily impacted by the ongoing pandemic. They also conclude that urban employees bear the brunt of the crisis to a larger extent than rural workers who are mostly involved in agriculture. Based on the data from the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Japan, ====, ==== and ==== identify self-employed and temporary employees as the groups most prone to the impacts of the crises such as COVID-19. Available scholarship provides evidence of unequal impact of lockdown on the economic well-being depending on the levels of income. In cases of the U.K. ====, Italy (====), China (====), Japan (====) and South Korea (====), the relatively poorer inhabitants tend to lose larger portions of income. In Italy, this tendency is even more pronounced for the fiscally better-off provinces, providing an evidence of the negative effect of mobility restrictions being magnified for the regions with higher levels of inequality (====). Additionally, ==== point at socioeconomic adversities associated with being younger, less educated and having limited access to health care. All in all, the evidence testifies to the fact that COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected the most vulnerable layers of society.====Despite the extensive coverage of the gender-related impacts of economic shocks, the findings appear inconclusive. While ==== and ==== argue that males are more likely to be victims of cyclical crises than females, ==== and ==== find out that females in the developed countries have felt the impacts of the COVID-19 more severely than males. According to ====, this tendency results from the fact that female-dominated service industries suffered most from the pandemic. Furthermore, the closures of childcare facilities have substantially increased the workload of mothers who often do not have any choice other than to quit their jobs in order to concentrate on parenting (====, ====). ==== approach this issue by additionally modeling income and working hours’ loss for the men involved in childcare, documenting their resulting vulnerability. Moreover, ==== conclude that males have lower chances of performing work duties remotely, which leads to a higher probability of job loss among them. In this context, ==== suggest that provision of telework infrastructure can remedy these negative effects.====While literature analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among developed states, little is known about its effects on people’s lives and social discrepancies in emerging economies. Our paper aims at identifying socioeconomic groups most heavily impacted by income loss and job loss in Indonesia — a country that epitomizes the challenges faced by developing countries. To this end, we analyze the 2020 Indonesian Labor Force Survey data, hypothesizing that COVID-19 has given idiosyncratic risks and impacts on people by gender, age, education, occupation and regions. We find that income loss and job loss are prominent among males, younger and less educated people as well as among self-employed and part-time workers. These tendencies are not pronounced for people enjoying high income, mobility and for those being able to work remotely, but are severe for urban residents and for those having dependents. Notably, self-employed people have the highest risk of losing income, while part-time urban workers face the highest probability of losing their jobs. Finally, through the implementation of propensity score matching (PSM) we determine that substantial drop in Facebook mobility characterizing COVID-19-impacted sub-provinces leads to high probabilities of income loss and job loss. Our study is therefore novel for (i) identifying crisis-inflicted perils associated with urban residency, especially for temporary employees, (ii) demonstrating the challenges that exist for breadwinners in the context of a community-oriented society and (iii) assessing the impact of mobility and teleworking on the socioeconomic resilience against the pandemic.====The following is the Supplementary material related to this article. ====

The Japanese government announced a universal cash payment program in April 2020, but the payment date differed across localities. This study estimates the correlation between this timing and local politicians’ characteristics, finding that local governments with mayors elected unopposed tended to start making payments comparatively early. As such, mayors elected uncontested may be able to mobilize resources within government offices to execute programs such as the Special Fixed Benefit program in Japan, which attracted public attention.","This study examines the political factors associated with the implementation of a benefit payment policy during the COVID-19 crisis in Japan. The COVID-19 crisis and related economic decline have posed enormous challenges to the economic, political, and institutional systems. As a part of the fiscal response, many countries adopted cash transfer policies to households, some of which were universal and unconditional, while others were not. The Japanese government employed universal ones to expedite implementation, but the time to pay the benefits was longer than expected and differed substantially across regions. This study examines the relationship between the timing of paying these benefits and political factors to understand how the government responded to the crisis and thus help policymakers prepare for future crises (====).====In particular, this study focuses on the implementation of the Special Fixed Benefit program, a universal cash payment program announced in April 2020 in Japan. This policy was decided by the central government and uniformly applied nationwide. The municipalities, the first tier of local government, which were responsible for the implementation of this program, faced huge administrative challenges, which led to differences in the starting dates of distributing the benefits (====). The first municipality started paying benefits in early May, but more than 10 % of municipalities had not yet started by early June. Therefore, the timing of the payments seems nearly random for researchers, who have thus regarded this setting as a natural experiment (====; ====; ====). This phenomenon is puzzling, considering that a universal cash payment has an advantage over selective benefits in that governments do not need information on income or assets of households and can distribute benefits quickly (====). Such timing differences were not observed in other countries that employed similar cash payment programs, including the United States, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong. The possible reasons for this variation include technical factors (e.g., population size and information processing system) and the government’s disaster preparedness (====).====This study examines the relationship between the payment timing and characteristics of the politicians who could intervene in the policy implementation (i.e., mayors) because the Special Fixed Benefit program attracted the public’s attention. The amount of JPY 100,000 (approximately USD 950), which is nontaxable, is sizable and equal to approximately 42 % of the median monthly income of a full-time worker (====). Under such circumstances, mayors might exert their political power to reallocate the resources within municipal offices to pay the benefits earlier. As this depends on the characteristics of politicians, this study examines this hypothesis.====This study is related to the growing literature that explains the heterogeneity in the responses of governments to COVID-19. Some studies examine the relationship with the political regime, finding that more democratic governments take less stringent action and face higher infection rates (====, ====, ====), but that their policies tend to be more effective (====, ====).====Policy responses often rely on subnational-level governments, which creates regional heterogeneity,==== especially in the United States (====). During the COVID-19 crisis, states led by Republican governors and those with term limits were slower to adopt social distancing policies (====; ====).==== However, no such differences were observed in Canada (====, ====). Policy responses can be associated with elections. Incumbent politicians who can run for re-election and those whose election is sooner tend to implement less stringent restrictions (====).==== Businesses in electorally important regions can also receive more government funds under the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program (====).==== Even in China, politicians respond to citizens’ discontent on the Internet (====).====The results of this study suggest that local governments with mayors who held their position through an uncontested election tended to start making payments earlier than others. However, no correlation with the winning margin in the last election is detected. These results are comparable to the Japanese literature on uncontested, or “walk-over,” mayors. Studies of political competition have found that politicians who face more stringent competition perform better (====, ====, ====) and bring better economic and social consequences (====, ====, ====, ====).==== Studies of Japanese cases, however, often find that uncontested mayors perform better in fiscal terms (====, ====, ====). Their interpretation is that unopposed mayors are strong politicians and receive broad-based support from residents and government officers. Such strong political leadership might have thus been able to mobilize the resources within government offices to execute the program that attracted public attention.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== presents the institutional background. ==== proposes the framework for our econometric specification. ==== presents the estimation results. ==== examines the yardstick hypothesis. ==== concludes.====.",Elections and COVID-19 benefit payments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049007823000507,11 May 2023,2023,Research Article,7.0

The extent of this adjustment depends on farming seasons and their liquidity. In contrast, small-scale tenant farmers reduce their farm size and machinery investment. Their choices are limited by the availability of off-farm employment opportunities. Therefore, the government should consider the heterogeneity of tenant farmers and help mitigate the constraints they face to promote the development of scale farming.",None,The polarization and constraints of scale farming in China under the impact of rising wages,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049007823000398,6 April 2023,2023,Research Article,14.0

These challenges increased production costs and significantly contributed to lower trade and higher ====. In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on Chinese trade through its two main trading partners: Japan and the US. By differentiating products by product type and processing status, we find evidence that products in the middle of the global supply chain were most affected by the pandemic and that the severity of the shock depends on the partner country’s role in the global supply chain. Additionally, we find that Chinese exports are more impacted than Chinese imports, regardless of processing status. These findings are largely consistent with ====. Understanding that the effects of global shocks vary by product and country will help guide policies that minimize supply chain disruptions.","In December 2019, doctors diagnosed the first case of COVID-19 in China’s Hubei province. The virus spread rapidly across China, leading to factory closures and a nationwide quarantine. Economists initially predicted that COVID-19 would diminish China’s economic growth from 6% to 5.4%, and if COVID caused a pandemic, the world GDP would decrease by $1.1 trillion (====). After two years, however, economists now predict losses of $18 trillion between 2020 and 2022 (====). The effects of COVID compromised the global economy, and it is imperative to understand the impact of the health crisis on global supply chains. The outbreak not only exposed health and economic weaknesses; it also revealed the critical role of China in global supply chains and the world economy’s reliance on Chinese trade and production.====To test our hypotheses, we focus on China’s trade with Japan and the US. In our empirical analysis, we use both annual and monthly trade data between China and its key partners from UN Comtrade. Processing trade involves products that use tariff-free imported inputs in the production of an export. We use Chinese customs data to determine processing classification for each product (HS 6-digit); this classification has been used extensively in past research (see, for example, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Additionally, we can classify processing trade as an intermediate, a capital, or even a consumption good.==== In line with our focus on bilateral trade, our processing data is country-product specific. In this paper, ==== equals one for a product with processing potential, as determined by whether or not the product contained processing value in 2007.==== If a product can be expanded internationally, it can also be expanded domestically, and hence is also more susceptible to supply chain shocks.====We explore the product-level effects of COVID-19 as a disruption to Chinese bilateral trade using monthly trade data from 2019 to mid-2021; note that our monthly data are mirrored using US and Japanese data due to data availability. With a robust ====, we find a differential effect on processing and non-processing trade, with the effect depending on the partner country. We identify four key findings. First, exports experienced a greater shock than imports, whether the exports are destined for the United States or for Japan, using 2019 trade as the omitted group. This may be an outcome of China’s zero-COVID policy, as discussed in a later section. Second, while non-processing exports drop, processing exports drop even more, especially in the first half of 2020. Thus, in line with our hypothesis, we find evidence that extensive reliance on foreign inputs in production makes products more likely to experience large drops in trade activity. Third, we find that the impact on processing goods by product type depends on the partner country: for Japan, intermediate-processing imports experience the sharpest relative drop, but for the United States, it is consumption-processing exports. This is an outcome of Japan’s role as a provider of processing-intermediate goods to China, and the US as a destination for processing-final goods. Lastly, we find little difference between trade levels in 2021 and those in 2019, meaning that while Chinese bilateral-trade has recovered from its substantial drop, it has yet to surpass 2019 levels. Our methodological approach is unique in our two-dimensional analysis of China’s bilateral trade levels by processing status and product type. This distinction helps estimate the widespread effects of COVID-19 on global supply chains more precisely than in previous research.====Our research adds to existing literature on supply chain disruptions, supply chains, and COVID-19. Global supply chains during COVID exhibited widespread unpredictability along every stage of the supply chain. According to the literature, unpredictability often predicts distorted demand information which then propagates upstream in an amplified form (====, ====). While complete access to demand information along the stages of the supply chain can typically reduce distortion (====, ====) and make supply chains more susceptible to changing consumer demand (====). Lastly, the extent of globalization at the time of the shock may also play a role in the magnitude of the COVID-19 economic disruption (====).====Recent literature on COVID indicates that both the type of good and a country’s position in the supply chain can have differential effects on trade. ==== build on these findings, using a risk assessment model to specify that countries with midstream roles in the global supply chain are particularly vulnerable. Empirical research on trade and COVID indicates that the most negative impact on supply chain performance is seen in cases with long-term disruptions to production and demand downstream (====), and that Asian exporters are more greatly affected than Asian non-exporters among micro, small, and medium enterprises (====). Despite major disruptions to exports and production, ====, finds no changes to trade centrality within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On a broader scale, ==== use a quantitative trade model with input–output linkages to gauge the global effects of COVID. Characterizing the disruption as a supply shock in China, they find moderate welfare losses in most countries, with the exception of a few that gain from trade diversion. Furthermore, they theorize that removing the U.S from global supply chains would hardly reduce the U.S exposure to supply shocks in China. We build on previous literature by distinguishing between product type and processing status in determining the effects of COVID on trade.====Because this research focuses largely on China, the effects of COVID on Chinese production and firm performance are also worth noting. ==== study the effects of the pandemic on Chinese firm performance, and find that labor-intensive firms are more negatively affected than capital-intensive firms, and firms necessary for life and production see increases in TFP. Internationally, ==== find that new cases, new deaths, and cumulative cases are all correlated with lower foreign direct investment in China. We address the severity of the pandemic in a later section in order the gauge its effects on production.====Our paper, more generally, contributes to literature analyzing how natural disruptions can cause abnormal activity in global supply chains. Existing research often exploits the effects of natural disasters to study supply chain shocks. In a study of supply chains after the Great Japan Earthquake, ==== conclude that inter-firm linkages serve as shock amplifiers. If this is the case, we would expect larger decreases for processing products. ==== study the effects of the eruption of Eyjafjallajokull on air transportation of exports and find that reduced imports from Europe were made up by increased imports from East Asia and the Americas, implying that countries adjust trade patterns in response to shocks. While natural disasters provide ample opportunity for the study of supply chain disruptions, the disruption of COVID-19 differs from those of natural disasters in critical ways. First, the widespread nature of COVID hinders intermediate good substitution from one country with those from another. Second, COVID disrupts an incredibly complex web of global supply chains where distance between connected firms is very high. These factors furthered the effects of COVID-19 on global supply chains.====The effects of disease on trade also help contextualize the disruption of COVID-19. ==== use Chinese firm data to understand the impact of the SARS epidemic on certain sectors of the global economy. The authors find that the SARS epidemic had substantial impacts on both import and export levels, and that increased interconnectedness in global production implies that supply shocks will have larger effects on connected firms and economies. On a domestic level, ====). Additionally, existing literature has concluded that supply chains became smaller in order to rebalance and were important for providing alternative exit scenarios (====) during the Great Recession. COVID may cause a shrinkage of supply chains similar to that of the Great Recession. If this is the case, we expect a substantial disruption during COVID-19 and a shift in suppliers as the disruption continues. Thus, our paper sheds light on trade behavior in times of global crisis, and has key implications for economic relationships.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section ==== discusses China’s role in global supply chains, and hypothesizes how trade, processing goods, and COVID-19 are linked together. Section ==== describes the data and provides stylized facts using annual and monthly trade data.

In addition, an increase in the equalization of profit rate and an increase in investment in the real economy reduce the positive effect of financial technology on the shadow banking activities.

We provide some evidence for the mechanism of deteriorated mental health status and pessimistic expectations.","The world is now entering the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported from an outbreak in Wuhan in the center of China in December 2019, it has rapidly spread around the world. As of 27 March 2022, it had infected over 480 million people and claimed over 6.1 million lives globally. The pandemic has also brought about severe economic and social disruption worldwide, including the worst global recession in the last eighty years. A better understanding of the medium and long-run effects of the pandemic may lead to more effective post-pandemic economic and social policies.====This paper examines the causal effects of COVID-19 exposure on trust. Trust is an element of virtually every business transaction, especially those that take place over time. A lack of mutual trust is a plausible explanation for much of the economic backwardness in the world (====). Theoretically, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on interpersonal trust is ambiguous. On the one hand, negative income shocks, interfered communication, pessimistic expectations, and mental health issues associated with the pandemic may diminish interpersonal trust (====, ====). On the other hand, the experience of external threats and the networks of mutual aid may increase a sense of community and connectedness among the general public (====, ====). Although several studies have discussed the changes of interpersonal trust amidst the COVID-19 pandemic (====, ====, ====), our knowledge of the causal effects of COVID-19 exposure on interpersonal trust is limited.====China provides an attractive setting to study the effects of COVID-19 exposure. China was the first country to implement drastic government interventions (including lockdowns and face mask mandates) and was also one of the fastest countries to bring the outbreak of the virus under control. Since then, China has maintained a dynamic zero-COVID strategy but its sustainability has been a subject of intense debate (====). The number of COVID-19 cases was minimal when the latest wave of the CFPS was conducted. Therefore, we estimate the persistent effects of COVID-19 exposure amidst zero-COVID policies. Specifically, we quantify COVID-19 exposure as the log of the number of infected cases in a province and the regional and temporal variations of COVID-19 infection allow us to adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy. Our individual-level data on interpersonal trust come from a nationally representative dataset, namely, the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS).====We find that individuals highly exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic exhibit lower levels of generalized trust. Nevertheless, the change in trust is heterogeneous across domains. Specifically, individuals with high COVID-19 exposure become significantly less trusting of parents, neighbors, and local government officials, but have no obvious changes in the levels of trust in strangers, Americans, or doctors. Our main results quantitatively go through several robustness checks, including testing the assumption of parallel trends, controlling for other simultaneous shocks, excluding the Hubei sample, using alternative measures of COVID-19 exposure, and employing an alternative estimation strategy.====We provide some suggestive evidence for the underlying mechanisms. We show that changes in interpersonal trust are not driven by changes in income, physical health status, or interpersonal communication. We provide some evidence that COVID-19 exposure reduces interpersonal trust by deteriorating mental health status and lowering future expectations. In addition, we show limited heterogeneity in the effects of COVID-19 exposure on interpersonal trust across gender, education, and age groups, which suggests that COVID-19 may have inflicted a deep and lasting social scar on the general population.====Our study contributes to two threads of literature. First, it relates to a growing body of literature on the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has slowed down economic activities considerably. Previous studies have documented that the COVID-19 pandemic produced negative effects on individual health status, educational achievement, and labor market performance (====, ====, ====). Our study indicates that the pandemic may also generate long-lasting impacts on economic performance by altering individual economic decision-making.====Second, our study contributes to the literature on social trust (====, ====). A growing body of literature has revealed that trust can be shaped by past experiences, such as climate changes (====), technological advances (====), political movement (====), natural disasters (====, ====), and civil conflicts (====, ====). Several recent studies have adopted a before-and-after design to examine changes of interpersonal trust amidst the COVID-19 pandemic but yielded mixed results (====, ====, ====). We adopt a DID strategy to investigate the persistent effects of COVID-19 exposure amidst zero-COVID policies. Our analyses indicate that other simultaneous temporal shocks may contaminate the estimated effects in the before-and-after studies. Therefore, one must be cautious in interpreting the results from the before-and-after studies (====, ====). In addition, we investigate the underlying mechanisms and heterogeneity in COVID-19 exposure effects which have received limited attention in the previous studies.====The remaining part of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== provides the conceptual framework. ==== introduces the data sets and the empirical strategies. ==== presents the baseline estimation results for interpersonal trust as well as the robustness checks and the discussion of underlying mechanisms, followed by the heterogeneity analysis. ==== compares our findings with previous studies.

We use a difference-in-differences methodology to estimate how containment zones of different severity across India impacted district-level nighttime light intensity, as well as household income and consumption. From May to July 2020, nighttime light intensity was 9.1 % lower in districts with the most severe restrictions compared with districts with the least severe restrictions, which could imply between 5.8 % and 6.6 % lower GDP. Nighttime light intensity was only 1.6 % lower in districts with intermediate restrictions. The differences were largest in May during the graded lockdown, and tapered in June and July. Lower house-hold income and consumption corresponding to zone-wise restrictions corroborate these results. Stricter containment measures had larger impacts in districts with greater population density, older residents, and more services employment. The large magnitudes of the findings suggest that governments should carefully consider the economic costs of country-wide pandemic containment policies while weighing the trade-offs against public health benefits. Keywords: Containment policies, COVID-19, Nighttime lights, India","The first COVID-19 infection in India was reported at the end of January 2020. On March 25, 2020, the government implemented one of the most stringent lockdowns globally (====). After five weeks of nationwide lockdown, uniform restrictions were replaced with targeted measures that varied in severity across districts in May 2020. The relaxation of restrictions across districts at three distinct levels allows us to examine the simultaneous spatial impacts of the differential containment measures. Specifically, districts were classified into three zones: those with the most severe restrictions (Red), those with intermediate restrictions (Orange), and those with the least severe restrictions (Green). Mobility data from Facebook and Google on cellphone locations confirm that the zone classification was indeed effective in restricting mobility.====Using a difference-in-differences methodology that exploits the rule-based district-wise containment policy, we compare the pace of economic recovery in the three zones after the uniform national lockdown ended. Using monthly data of nighttime lights at the district level, we examine the impact of these differential relaxations of restrictions on aggregate economic activity. We also examine the period after the differential lockdown to understand how long the effect of zone-wise containment persisted even after the ==== restrictions were lifted. We explain the aggregate impact by analyzing nighttime light intensity at the district level and corroborate our results with household-level income and consumption patterns. More developed districts might respond differently compared with less developed ones, as the more developed districts may have better economic or administrative capacity to deal with the COVID-19 restrictions, or conversely, the more developed districts suffer larger economic losses due to concentration of more contactintensive sectors. Thus, we also compare the impact of the zone-wise containment policies across districts by population density, the share of services sector employment, outstanding credit per capita, and average age.====We use nighttime light intensity as our main proxy for economic activity for several reasons. First, a number of studies report high correlation of nighttime light intensity with other measures of economic activity (====). Most notably, ==== argue that for countries with poor national income accounts, the optimal estimate of growth is a composite measure with roughly equal weights on conventionally measured growth and growth predicted from nighttime lights. Nighttime lights track economic activity in India closely (====, ====), and provide a useful approximation of economic activity at high spatial granularity (====, ====). In a recent study, ==== use cross-sectional differences in nighttime light growth to assess the effect of the 2016 Indian banknote demonetization. Second, using nighttime lights is particularly appropriate for this study since this measure is available at high spatial granularity at monthly frequency.==== This allows us to match nighttime lights to the relevant district-level zone classification to determine economic activity in the pre-period in March and April, and to compare it with activity in the postperiod in May, June, and July. In contrast, official quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) and other measures of overall economic activity, like electricity consumption are available at lower frequency and not disaggregated at the district level.==== Finally, nighttime lights from satellites represent an objective measure of economic activity that is immune to survey non-response bias that is potentially correlated with lockdown policies.====Two caveats of using nighttime lights as a proxy for economic activity are worth pointing out. First, while the nighttime lights data used in this study track data in low-lit areas more accurately than previous generations of nighttime lights data,==== the better tracking of economic activity in brighter areas may still bias the results (====). Second, translating changes in nighttime lights into changes in GDP is not straightforward, and the elasticity between the two may vary substantially across levels of geographic aggregation and across contexts (====, ====, ====). We directly address these concerns in the robustness section and when interpreting the results. Moreover, we supplement the nighttime light analysis with consumption and income data from a household survey, both to pin point the impact of the zone restrictions on these outcomes separately from economic activity, and to corroborate the qualitative conclusions from using nighttime lights data.====Our first empirical result confirms that the zone classifications impacted mobility which is consistent with the severity of the restrictions. Mobility was significantly lower in Red zone districts in May compared with Green zone districts, consistent with the most severe mobility restrictions in those districts. Orange zone districts had lower mobility than Green zone districts, but the impact was not statistically significant. During “Unlock 1.0″ in June, mobility rebounded in both Red and Orange zone districts, consistent with removal of the zone classifications. These results point to the effectiveness of the ==== restrictions during the pandemic.====Our main finding is that nighttime light intensity in India dimmed during the strict national lockdown in March and April, and recovery in May and subsequent months (referred to as the post period hereafter) depended on the zone classification. Overall, nighttime light intensity was 9.1 % (0.045 σ) lower in the post period (May to July 2020) for Red zone districts with the most severe restrictions and 1.6 % (0.009 σ) lower for Orange zone districts with intermediate restrictions, compared with Green zone districts with the least restrictions. Red zone districts witnessed a 12.6 % (0.061 σ) lower recovery in May compared with Orange zone districts. The recovery for districts with intermediate restrictions was 1.7 % (0.010 σ) lower. While remaining negative, the impact of the zone classification tapered off in June and July 2020, pointing to the persistent effects of pandemic containment even after restrictions were removed.====Our findings are robust to several logically orthogonal robustness checks. These include a test of the impact of the zone classification on the pre-period, where we reassuringly find no discernible differential pattern. We restrict the sample to only those districts that border a differently classified zone, to nonmetropolitan districts, and those that were not subsequently reclassified in mid-May, and find no qualitative change in our results. Finally, a test with placebo zone classifications yields coefficients that are close to zero and statistically insignificant, implying that the zone restrictions, not other district level factors, are driving the results.==== deployed as a counter-cyclical measure, as well as inter-district migrant shares (which proxy for reverse migration after the lockdown) do not effect these dynamics.====Our study contributes to the growing literature on the economic impacts of government interventions to mitigate health shocks. ==== find large effects of containment measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 on economic activity across countries. ==== examine the drivers of the pandemic-related economic decline in the United States and compare consumer behavior across commuting zones to distinguish between government restrictions and the role of fear – both of which matter. ==== draw on considerable private sector data to analyze how household spending and business activity changed in response to the pandemic and associated government stabilization policies, whereas ==== use unemployment insurance claims data to examine the effect of stay-at-home orders on employment. ==== quantify the employment impact of different state-level containment measures in the United States, and ==== shows that high non-routine jobs reduce the probability of job losses. During the 1918 pandemic in India ==== finds that Indian district officers were more effective than British officers in containing infections and deaths. While disruptive in the short-run, ==== show that stricter government interventions in cities in the United States during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic had positive economic impacts in the medium run.====We also contribute to the literature on the economic and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. ==== employ state-level daily electricity consumption to assess the economic cost of the uniform lockdown during March and April 2020 in India, and use monthly nighttime light intensity to explain drivers of district-level heterogeneity. Our paper is distinct from ==== in examining differential lockdown policies with cross-sectional variation that permits us to offer causal interpretations. We are able to exploit additional data sources both to confirm the effectiveness of the mobility restrictions, as well as to corroborate our main findings. ==== look at the disruption in food supply chains and find a minimal impact on prices but falling food availability. ==== employ the same zone classification as we do to analyze its impact on gender-based violence and find that complaints were higher in districts with more severe restrictions.",Lights out?

A research gap which is obvious in the current literature is understanding of these policies on the economic indicators and the relative importance of different kind of policies announced during the pandemic by multitude of policy makers.==== A recent paper by ==== suggests the efficacy of fiscal policies in stabilizing equity markets in South East Asian nations while monetary actions not showing short term significant impact.====, ====, ====; ====). Recent work of ====, ====, ==== and ==== have highlighted the shift to studying diverse and aggregate policy measures in understanding inflation targeting. This is in contrast to earlier works of ====, ==== and ====The key question from government and policy makers in the current pandemic phase is whether their actions and interventions are resulting in the maintenance of price stability. Our hypothesis based on the above discussions is that policy actions and government interventions assist in maintaining price stability and inflation targeting measured via Consumer Price Index (CPI). In this paper, we propose to test this proposition, by estimating a determinants embedded model for CPI via controlling for COVID stringency and lockdowns as discussed in currently evolving literature of COVID-19 (====; ====; ====). This is further augmented by understanding the response of CPI to the type of policy intervention as well as its nature to guide policymakers.====Focusing on selected member countries of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC)====This study makes contribution in two aspects. Firstly, this study is amongst the first to study and document the role of government policies and its impact on CPI and economic indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic (See: ====; ====; ====; ====) We were able to distinguish policy actions between monetary and financial actions in comparison with fiscal actions and grants/aid. An important implication of these findings is that fiscal actions may take a longer time to take effect in impacting the CPI in economies while grants/aid are more temporary measures. As suggested by ====, monetary and fiscal measures’ impact on economy is intertwined. Additionally, our analysis suggests that amongst the varied nature of policy actions, direct credit support and healthcare targeted policy actions significantly impacted the CPI in the SAARC countries considered. Healthcare Support impact suggests that in sample countries where public health structures are still in developing phase provided support in curbing rising inflation.====Second, our findings contribute to enhancing the evolving literature on the impact of COVID-19 in Asian countries’ financial and economic systems (see, for instance, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====On the policymakers’ front with multitude of interventions and actions, policy coordination is urgently needed so that their impact on growth, inflation, and financial stability can be optimized. Our study contributes to this policymakers’ dilemma by focusing on the impact on price stability measured via CPI. Our findings contribute to the understanding of policymakers by suggesting reliance on more monetary measures to maintain price stability rather than fiscal actions or aids/grants. On the specific nature of actions to be undertaken this study contributes by suggesting focus on Credit Support, and Healthcare Support as key measures assisting in curbing consumer price index.====While we contribute to the literature, our current study has limitations too which we address in Section IV.

However, it is worthwhile to empirically explore the effect of land rental on overall technical efficiency in the context of Chinese agriculture because non-farm household producers have increasingly entered the farming business as cultivators. If such producers underperform farm households in terms of efficiency, land consolidation does not necessarily deliver the desired outcome. This study demonstrates that the development of land rental markets improves agricultural technical efficiency at the aggregate level.

This is because, while the central government has long strived to maintain a high grain self-sufficiency rate, the relative prices of farm products have recently moved in favor of non-grain products.

Based on the outcomes of its business, the parents make an optimal decision on the level of their children’s schooling investment. Solving the maximisation problem, we show that a household’s optimal education for its children is directly related to the level of microcredit. Empirically, we utilise the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS) dataset from 2008 to 2016 to estimate the impact of microcredit on rural children’s schooling.

Negative effects on income were largest for the single-person households in ages 50—64, mostly driven by decreases in earned income rather than business income. There was no corresponding decrease in consumption expenditures, however, other than on transportation expenditure for young men. Notably, there were significant decreases in non-consumption expenditures that are related to formal and informal consumption-smoothing mechanisms, such as spending on insurances, pensions, and household transfers.

The effects of the pandemic on the economy persisted (====), however, providing lessons to other countries working towards ending the pandemic and economic recovery.====In this study, we investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on household income and expenditure in South Korea, with a focus on the experience of single-person households. The number of single-person households rose rapidly around the world for all ages and gender, representing more than one-third of all households in many developed countries (====, ====). However, they were rarely studied in economics even though the literature suggests that working-age single-person households are likely to be highly vulnerable to economic shocks (====).====Using a nationally representative survey of income and expenditure in South Korea, we find that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, (1) household income and expenditure decreased, but not for the expenditure on necessities; (2) non-consumption expenditure related to formal and informal consumption-smoothing mechanisms declined significantly; and (3) the negative effects were greater for single-person households, especially for those between ages 50 and 64.====Our contributions to the literature are as follows. First, we estimate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on both income and expenditure using nationally representative data in South Korea that includes cash transactions and household transfers. Previous studies on the effects of the pandemic on expenditure or consumption often used credit-card transaction data which do not include cash transactions and transfers. We also add evidence from South Korea, extending previous studies which focused on the spending behaviors of Seoul residents only (====, ====).====Second, we show that households reduced expenditures on consumption smoothing mechanisms including insurance, pension, and household transfers during the COVID-19 pandemic, making them more vulnerable to future negative income shocks. Literature did not investigate the effects of the pandemic on non-consumption expenditures with few exceptions (====). Focusing only on the immediate effects on income and consumption may understate the true damage of the pandemic.====Third, we show that single-person households were more negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than multi-persons households. Previous studies identified women and low-skilled workers as vulnerable groups (====, ====) but did not focus on the effects on single-person households. Given that single-person households have more limited access to within-household insurance mechanisms (====, ====), negative effects on their income and consumption-smoothing mechanisms imply they are likely to be even more vulnerable to future negative income shocks compared to other types of households.====The rest of this study proceeds as follows. ==== discusses previous studies on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. ==== explains the background information on the single-person households in Korea. ==== describes the data set used in the study and ==== discusses the empirical model, the Difference-in-Differences method. ==== presents empirical results with further discussions in ====. ==== concludes.====.",Impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on single-person households in South Korea,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049007822001130,11 November 2022,2022,Research Article,52.0

An example is workplace-closing policies, which require closing all-but-essential workplaces (e.g., grocery stores). If the workplace-closing policy banned factory operations, production activities would stop entirely. For example, Japanese car manufacturers have suspended their production in Japan for several days monthly since April 2020. However, some ====In this study, we examine how economic and social activities in East Asia and Southeast Asia were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample includes 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) nations and six partner countries of ASEAN+1 ==== agreements (FTAs). Owing to these trade linkages, the countries under study may follow a common economic mechanism even during the pandemic era. We examine the regions that have resumed economic and social activities early. The magnitudes of those activities were measured using the emissions of various air pollutants. One advantage of using air pollution data is that the data are provided almost instantaneously (near real-time data) daily and with a very high spatial resolution. We then aggregate these data by months and subnational regions. Our study period is from January to October in 2019 and 2020. Using this measure, we determine how the quantity of air pollutants emitted is related to economic or regional attributes, such as establishments or infrastructure. Those regional characteristics are identified by employing the remotely sensed land cover dataset and OpenStreetMap (OSM).====Our analytical framework presents the empirical means to instantaneously uncover what is happening at a detailed regional level. This paper relies solely on publicly available data; thus, anyone can conduct similar investigations. Furthermore, the data used are available for most countries, including the least developed. In short, our data are not official data collected or published by governments. Nevertheless, the availability of such data is an important advantage for developing countries that do not collect sufficient official data. In particular, governments must immediately understand the effects of sudden shocks such as COVID-19. Such effects include not only those of the shocks per se but also those of policy interventions designed to address the shocks. Our empirical framework allows us to instantaneously examine those effects at a detailed regional level. In this study, we demonstrate how this framework is applied to examining COVID-19 shocks.====Furthermore, through this study, we contribute to the growing literature on the effects of lockdown orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies have investigated the effect of lockdown orders on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (====, ====, ====), the number of deaths (====), unemployment insurance claims (====). Furthermore, many studies have also examined the effect of lockdown orders on air pollution. Although most of these studies investigated the effect for a specific country or region,==== some studies have examined the effect of lockdowns on the quantity of air pollutants emitted for a global sample (e.g., ====; ====; ====). These studies have consistently found that lockdown orders decreased the amount of air pollutants emitted. Unlike the aforementioned studies, this research particularly examines the geographical or economic attributes of regions that recovered early from the negative effects of lockdown orders.====The major findings can be summarized as follows. First, according to the emissions data from 2019 to 2020, the quantity of air pollutants emitted decreased in most subnational regions. Second, the change in emissions was not uniform across the regions in a country. In several countries, economic and social activities seem to have started in some specific regions. Third, the ==== indicate that in the case of ASEAN forerunners, economic and social activities in crops, industrial estates, accommodations, restaurants, education, and public services have not fully recovered. However, full recovery or increase in tourism sites is apparent. In the case of ASEAN latecomers, activities in accommodation and automotive sectors decreased and later returned to normal. More activities were found in restaurants in 2020. However, activities in education sites have remained low. In the ASEAN+ 1 FTA partner countries, no significant changes were noted in the economic and social activities in most locations, other than shops and sports sites, where activities decreased.====The remainder of this paper is organized into four sections. ==== introduces the air pollutants examined in this study. ==== presents the empirical framework. ==== shows the estimation results. ==== concludes the paper.",How is the Asian economy recovering from COVID-19?

Economic restrictions, notably strict border controls and lockdowns, have led many workers to lose their jobs and forced many migrants to return to their homes or change their migration plans. While adverse effects on ==== are expected, variations in the prevalence of COVID-19 and governmental responses to the pandemic across countries are likely to influence workers’ intentions to migrate in different ways.

While the full impact of this pandemic on the world economy and labor markets is yet to be determined, recent studies have provided quantitative evidence of its negative impact. ==== suggest that the employment rate decreased after the stay-at-home mandate in the U.S., while ==== and ==== imply that there have been heterogeneous effects of this pandemic on unemployment in the U.S., and these effects have impacted minorities with particular severity. In addition, ==== explain that unemployment has severely affected immigrants in the United States.====These adverse effects have expanded globally, not only in industrialized countries but also in developing countries, where the impact is more severe. According to ====; ====; ====). Moreover, border controls have prohibited the entry of foreign workers into host countries. As the early estimates, ====; ====). As for this pandemic, for example, it has been reported that the number of people seeking information about emigrating to New Zealand, which has been relatively successful in containing the virus, increased by 65 % in the U.S. and by 18.5 % in the U.K. in May 2020 compared to the same month one year ago (====). On the other hand, workers may not consider migration during the pandemic because most countries have implemented strict border control policies. A survey of nationals in Central America and Mexico, who had the intentions of migrating in the past year, reveals that COVID-19 has affected their immigration plans, and 10 % of those who had intended to migrate no longer wished to do so (====). While some studies have examined the effects of past pandemics on labor markets (====; ====), the unprecedented scale of COVID-19 suggests the need for further investigation, especially in regard to the international labor market. Moreover, among the emerging studies on the effects of COVID-19, there is still limited evidence from developing countries.====To understand the immediate effects of pandemics on the cross-border labor supply, we explore the impact of COVID-19 and various economic restriction policies on job search behavior using the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to consider cases from Asia, where we witness a substantial influx and outflux of migration within the region (====). We examine how the search volume of job- or migration-related queries was affected by COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns using panel data with daily online search trends based on the Google Trends Index (GTI) in the Southeast Asian countries. The GTI reflects the search intensities of queries submitted to the Google search engine worldwide (====). Relying on big data such as the GTI has several advantages. First, the big data are available in real time. Collecting data for effective policymaking is difficult while this pandemic continues around the world. Even if household data could be collected, there is a considerable lag in regard to when the published data are available to the public. In developing countries, these costs and lags regarding data collection commonly occur in survey-based research, even in ordinary times, and data relating to job security or to migration intentions are often unavailable (====). Therefore, when needed to implement sound policy frameworks immediately, real-time big data become a powerful tool for research and policymaking (====). Second, the use of big data has been shown to predict economic outcomes more accurately than traditional benchmark models. Above all, researchers can obtain economic trends or contemporary demands among Internet users using online search data. Recent literature implies that the GTI can be used to predict economic outcomes such as unemployment rate (====; ====), employment growth (====), real GDP (====), stock price (====), and migration flows (====). Many models using the GTI outperform the benchmark model with only the traditional economic measures, which are collected by the physical survey, because the Google searches reflect the revealed and timely demands for information with related queries.==== The GTI trends will capture the stream about interest of people and forecast the future outcomes of the related activities.====In our research, in addition to GTI data, we use data from a daily index on the strictness of government policy measures imposed to combat COVID-19 published by the University of Oxford, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 as provided by Johns Hopkins University, and GDP per capita and unemployment rates for each country from the World Bank and the IMF. We select data on Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, where many nationals travel overseas for work, while we also collect policy- and COVID-19-related data for Taiwan and Japan. Taiwan and Japan are selected for the potential destinations of the bilateral migration in our research because the numbers of migrant workers from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam to two host countries are rapidly increasing in recent years, and the prevalence of COVID-19 and the government measures enacted were different between these destinations. We collect data from December 2, 2018, to August 3, 2019, as the ex-ante period, and from December 1, 2019, to August 1, 2020, as the ex-post period, with 1470 daily samples in total (245 days for each period and each country); using this information, we construct the daily panel data. We obtain the GTI data of queries in the native languages given the local job market situations and then adjust the index to compare the trends. To explore the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures on daily job-related search activities, we employ the DID approach to compare same-date samples over the respective periods, following some literatures which explore the impacts of COVID-19 (e.g., ====; ====). We examine whether the search outcomes are systematically different across these periods before and after the announcement of the emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the consequent lockdown announcement in the capital of each country, during the assigned time frame.====The results suggest that the search volume of queries related to employment stability, such as “job,” which is strongly correlated with the unemployment rate as the extant literature implies, dramatically increased after the outbreak of COVID-19 in the three Southeast Asian countries in question. Such trends have intensified over time, and we find that the volume dramatically increased after the release of the lockdown restriction. On the other hand, the search queries related to remittance decreased after the lockdown, and this tendency was reinforced after the lockdown was lifted. Moreover, we observe that bilateral queries to capture the migration intentions (====These results imply that job insecurity increased for an unexplained reason, possibly unemployment or facility closures, after the virus became an epidemic; however, interest in remittance decreased. Moreover, we confirm that the solid expectation of migrating outside the country has not been enhanced in these countries, although the general concern for work or common interest in other countries seems to have increased dramatically. Thus, the priority among workers in developing countries is maintaining their livelihood during the pandemic. Even though migrating to developed countries may increase income, relocating to other countries becomes less of an option among their solutions after a large adverse shock.====This study contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, it provides insight into the economic and social impact of epidemics, and specifically, COVID-19 in developing countries. After the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers in empirical economics have explored the effects of this pandemic and the related social distancing policies. Some studies explain the adverse effects in labor markets in industrialized countries such as the U.S. (====; ====; ====; ====) or Japan (====). As for studies in developing countries, researchers have explored the effects of the pandemic and the consequent recessions on households’ livelihoods (====; ====; ====), business performance (====; ====), and macro economies (====; ====). However, because of data limitations, the literature in the context of developing economies is still scarce, especially in labor-supply research. This study is the first to examine the change in job search behaviors following the appearance of COVID-19 in these developing countries using timely response data. Our estimates will help understand the response to lockdown restrictions on laborers in developing countries.====Second, this research adds to the body of literature on the use of big data in economic research in emerging and developing countries. ==== explain the benefits of using big data, especially the GTI, for policymaking and economic or development research because timely data are often not available in low- and middle-income countries, and this may solve the problem of time lags in obtaining datasets. Some studies using GTI data explore economic behavior after the outbreak of COVID-19 during this time when it is difficult to collect data directly, including consumer behavior (====), job-related activities (====; ====), mental health (====), and information gathering about the pandemic (====). Although some studies have utilized the GTI to predict economic outcomes in emerging and developing countries, such as the unemployment rate in Turkey (====) or in Romania (====), the number of existing works using GTI in developing countries is much more limited than that in industrialized countries, as ==== suggest. While the online-based job-hunting process has been flourished in developing countries (====), we need to beware that the Internet usage rates in developing countries are relatively lower than those in developed countries; thus, such research using online data may only produce biased results from a minority group of people who have access to the Internet (====). In our context, however, the digital infrastructure in the three targeted countries has undergone a massive transformation during the current decade, and between 2009 and 2019, the Internet usage rate among the entire population in each country has dramatically increased (6.9 %–47.7 % in Indonesia, 9.0 %–43.0 % in the Philippines, and 26.6 %–68.7 % in Vietnam).==== ==== We believe that the increase in internet availability allows us to estimate the causal effects on the concerns for working and migration in the general population in the countries before and after this pandemic using big data.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the context of the study. Section III reports the data, and Section IV discusses the estimation strategies employed. Section V presents the estimation results, and Section VI concludes the paper.====We analyze the workhorse models of international migration to verify whether our selected GTIs would predict the international migration flow. Our procedure is following ====. We compare the gravity model depending on the traditional macroeconomic factors and the other model containing the four GTIs we assigned in this research, and evaluate how accurately these models capture the international migration flow. The assumption of this research is the inflows to Japan and Taiwan from three Southeast Asian countries; however, as the data about the number of entries by nationalities is not in public by the Taiwan government, we consider the case of Japan here. We obtain the monthly data about entries into Japan sorted by the nationalities and the type of visas n from the Immigration Services Agency of Japan. The survey period is from January 2009 to December 2019. We exclude the number of entries by the short-term visa and construct the monthly entry data from three countries for 120 months. Thus, we have 360 monthly data. About the GTI data, we obtain the monthly GTI data of four single keywords, four bilateral keywords, and two country’s names during the period from January 2008 to December 2018 in each origin because the preparation for migration takes time, and we omit the reverse causality.==== We acquire the annual GDP and population records of both origins and Japan from the World Bank database within the same period as those of the GTI data.==== After constructing the year-month-based panel data, we run the fixed-effect model.

Rapid internationalization often prevents multinational corporations (MNCs) from absorbing and internalizing internationalized knowledge in a timely manner and achieving ideal performance.

Our simulation results find that all countries’ trade and exports will be significantly hurt by the pandemic.

This paper examined the COVID-19 impact on Chinese business investment in 3326 A-share listed quarterly financial reports, from which it was found that the negative relationship was more pronounced in the large, eastern Chinese state-owned firms. Using a ==== method and difference-in-differences estimation, corporate financial flexibility was also examined, with the results indicating that high cash flexibility provided a buffer that allowed firms to better deal with adverse external shocks as the firms that had high cash flexibility were able to significantly increase their investments after the COVID-19 outbreak. Various robustness tests were conducted, all of which verified the robustness of the results. Overall, the empirical results provided evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic in China had a negative impact on Chinese listed firms, and verified the vital role of flexible financial reserves for firm survival and development during crises.","In January 2020, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) broke out in China and rapidly spread across the country and the world. To contain the pandemic, Chinese government authorities at all levels adopted measures to curtail the spread, such as home isolation, social distancing, travel and transport restrictions, and the temporary suspension of non-essential economic activities, all of which placed significant pressure on economic growth in 2020. These COVID-19 curtailment actions were a huge shock to micro-firm capital chains, making it difficult to sustain general operations. A February 2020 survey reported that 68.39 % of firms that mainly operated offline (and 72.87 % of online firms) expected to be able to maintain their cash flows for no more than three months.====; ====) and accounts receivable recovery rates, which could result in fund defaults, inventory overstocks, and long-term losses (====; ====Externally, the outbreak resulted in a significant shock to the global capital market (====; ====), with the stock market value plunging and stock issuances blocked or stopped, making it difficult for firms to sustain their equity capital (====; ====).====It has been found that when firms are facing financing constraints, cash flow risk has a significant positive effect on cash holdings (====; ====). Cash flow risks generated by adverse external shocks have also been found to have a greater impact on cash flow. Agency and trade-off theories claim that firms would be more likely to hold cash during a pandemic for preventive motivation or to take advantage of favorable investment opportunities (====). However, firms with less cash flexibility would find it difficult to repay the principal and interest on their loans, would face huge external financing constraints, and would encounter obstacles to refinancing, which would result in less spending on technology, employees, and capital equipment (====; ====). Therefore, firms with low leverage and high cash holdings have a significantly better anti-risk ability when faced with sudden shocks as they can take advantage of cash investment opportunities and maintain or increase firm value (====). As the pandemic, caused a sharp fall in capital assets, the value of firms suffering from financial crises and bankruptcy fell. However, while the crisis also provided good opportunities to expand for firms that had cash flexibility, firms that lacked cash flexibility lost investment opportunities (====; ====).====); however, COVID-19’s impact on corporate cash flow has been largely overlooked.====). Therefore, unlike most of the recent literature, this study examined the impact of COVID-19 on firm cash flows, combined the latest quarterly financial reports from Chinese A-share listed firms and compared first quarter, 2020, and fourth quarter, 2019, data to quantitatively analyze the COVID-19 impact on corporate investment expenditure. Based on 3,326 A-share listed firms’ quarterly financial reports, the empirical results show that the outbreak reduced firms’ investment expenditures, and find this negative relationship is more pronounced in the large, eastern Chinese state-owned firms. As the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an impact for a longer time, research on its effects on corporate cash flows and the possible financial risks could be of significant value. Therefore, this paper contributes to existing research on the COVID-19 pandemic and enriches research on firm heterogeneity in the context of the pandemic.====Second, this study supplements existing literature on the value of financial flexibility. Prior studies confirmed that financial flexibility could improve core competitiveness, and was conducive to the optimal allocation of financial resources and the effective management of financial risk; however, there has been little research on the advantages of financial flexibility in an external crisis, with research on crisis resistance being mostly related to the impacts of financial turmoil. This paper used a PSM-DID method to study the role of corporate cash flexibility in responding to adverse external shocks from public health issues. Taking corporate cash flexibility as the entry point and proving the importance of cash flexibility in public health crisis periods, this paper supplements research on the buffer role played by corporate financial flexibility during such crises.====Third and last, our results can provide certain guidance for firms and government on how to relieve business operation and investment pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the firm’s daily operations are blocked at the time of the crisis, there is a risk of breaking the cash chain, thus profitable investment opportunities may be missed. Therefore, firms should pay more attention to the management of cash reserves and establish reasonable cash flexibility. As the substantial deterioration of firm financing environment and substantial declines in firm financing capacities would last for a long time during the pandemic, the related authorities should also take corresponding measures to support firms with less cash flexibility but holding important position in supply chains to alleviate the negative impacts caused by external shocks.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

We find that in our settings, imposing a strict rule is not always the best strategy to manage a common pool resource. In fact, allowing a higher level of resource use yields more desirable social (more equitable payoffs distribution), economic (individual payoff), and environmental (remaining resource stock) outcomes.

The cost of loans, however, may vary by the source of funds. MFI loans, while low in terms of interest cost, usually require a savings deposit, loan or application fee, with a longer trip or waiting time. Hence, households resort to loans from informal sources to deal with crises. We estimate the impulse responses of loans from different sources, which clearly show a hump-shape centring for the months of disasters. Pre-emptive loans are associated only with partially anticipated shocks. Aggregate shocks also limit how much households can borrow from their local peers.
