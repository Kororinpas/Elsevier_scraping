Our findings indicate trust, coordination, altruism, and cooperation between these groups are not affected by priming people on the ethnic identity of their partners or on the salience of election conflict.

Due to the temporary shortage of appropriate vaccines, a systematic change in human behaviour is necessary to keep the spread of the virus under control, increasing the quality of basic hygiene practices, such as systematic hand hygiene. Nudges are increasingly used in public health interventions to promote critical preventive hygiene behaviours. This review aimed to investigate the effect and the characteristics of nudges on hand hygiene, as a COVID-19 preventive measure. We systematically reviewed the relevant literature from January 2008 to November 2020. A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings of this review showed that most of the nudging interventions had a positive effect on hand hygiene. Nudges should be included in the existing and future public health interventions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics, rather than being an alternative and unconventional tool for public health policies.","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic of the new coronavirus COVID-19 (====). The coronavirus disease is a highly infectious disease and has spread very fast all over the world. Due to the temporary shortage of appropriate vaccines at the early stages of the pandemic, a systematic change in human behaviour was necessary to keep the spread of COVID-19 under control, increasing the quality of basic hygiene practices, such as systematic hand hygiene (====).====The COVID-19 pandemic is a strong reminder that one of the most important, simplest and cost–effective ways to reduce the spread of the virus is hand hygiene. Hand hygiene is referring to as any action of hand cleansing by either washing them with soap and water, or by using an alcohol-based hand sanitising gel, following the appropriate hand- washing practices (====). Hand hygiene is a preventive behaviour, which is determined by a range of psychological, social, emotional, environmental and habitual factors (====).====Hand hygiene is especially important when done at the right time, with the right tools (soap and water or with sanitiser gel) and with the appropriate technique. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends continuous hand hygiene and regular cleaning, as these kill the viruses that may be on the hands (==== showed that frequent hand- washing has a large and significant protective effect against a pandemic influenza. Increased hand hygiene is associated with lower hospitalisation rates (====). It also protects against a number of other diseases such as the common flu, diarrhoea (====) and pneumonia (====). A meta-analysis in 2018 states that hand-washing with soap and water can reduce diarrhoea by 23% - 48% (====) and respiratory infections by 21% −23% (====).====).====Traditional approaches to promoting hand hygiene, including providing information about the risks of poor hygiene, have shown limited effectiveness. An effective behaviour change requires more than just educational and informational campaigns (====). Nudges received considerable attention in recent years and contributed to several fields of public health, one of those is hand hygiene (====).====The nudge concept was developed by ==== in a seminal book for public policy==== and the public perception of behavioural economics. A nudge is “any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives” (====, p. 8).====Researchers and policy-makers are increasingly recognising the importance of nudges in decision-making, and the ability to reap significant benefits through relatively small changes in human decisions (====). Nudges have been widely used in conducting experiments and research in the context of improving decision-making. Some of these areas of research are energy consumption (====), environmental protection (====) and health (====; ====; ====).====The current systematic review aimed at investigating the effect and the characteristics of nudges on hand hygiene, as a COVID-19 preventive measure.",A systematic review of nudges on hand hygiene against the spread of COVID-19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804323000721,30 May 2023,2023,Research Article,2.0

Home-bound, many turn to the media to learn about the actions of fellow citizens and political leaders as potential role models.==== Imagine you are watching the evening news and you see coverage of people defying social distancing guidelines, partying on the beach, or congregating in restaurants. Would you give up on flattening the curve or increase your efforts to make up for failings of others? What if, instead, you saw reporting of thousands of people volunteering as health workers in their communities? Would you be inspired and join the fray or sit back more relaxed, knowing that others fill in the void?

We observe a similar pattern for the volunteering outcome (although the difference is not statistically significant). Positive private role models beget more positive behavior, resulting in a virtuous cycle of prosociality; the opposite is true for negative role models (====).==== and are 53% ==== likely to take steps to learn about volunteering opportunities compared to people who watch politicians mismanaging the crisis. In sum, results suggest that the actions of government officials are seen as substitutes, those of fellow citizens as complements to the participants’ own actions.====These results can be reconciled by Schwartz’s seminal Norm Activation Model (NAM) (====), which posits that prosocial behavior depends on both the adoption of prosocial norms and a sense of responsibility among individuals for taking actions that satisfy those norms. Trust is one of the key norms among groups that succeeded in acting prosocially and avoiding prisoner’s dilemmas (====). Studies find that the majority of people are “====”: they are willing to contribute to a public good if they believe that others will do the same (====). Making sacrifices requires trust in reciprocity — otherwise an individual’s own costly actions are ultimately fruitless. Norms of trust can thus create coordinated responses without the need for negotiations, explicit agreements or enforcement. We find that that trust is influenced by the actions of private role models: people who watched positive examples are 21% more likely to agree with the statement “====” than those who watched the negative examples of private role models.====By contrast, public role models do not affect trust norms. They do, however, influence whether people feel responsible to contribute to a collective action problem. Watching the video of failing political leaders leads to a 70% increase in the share of participants who report that personal responsibility to take action was an important factor in their decision how much to donate. While pinning down the exact causal channel is challenging (====), these findings suggest that positive private role models are effective because they increase norms of trust. By contrast, observing negative public role models may increase prosocial behavior because it increases people’s responsibility to “step up” and take action.====These results speak to a rapidly emerging literature on the COVID-19 crisis. The question of how to encourage prosocial behavior has received renewed interest during the pandemic (====). Several studies show that there is a link between the perception of COVID-19 risk and prosocial behavior (====, ====, ====). These findings are important as ==== demonstrate that prosociality predicts health behavior such as physical distancing and buying face mask during the current pandemic.====) and social comparison theory (====). Role models have been shown to influence others by acting as behavioral models, showing what is feasible, and inspiring people (====). Our intervention is most closely related to a set of studies that specifically test the effect of role models in entertainment and news media. These have been shown to increase female autonomy (====), reduce fertility (====), among other behaviors.====Last, our study speaks to the literature on public good provision. Studies have found that people consider private and public contributions to public goods as substitutes (====). For example, if government funding to charitable organizations increases people tend to give less (====, ====). Our results suggest that this substitution behavior extends to the ==== of the government to provide public goods and confirms that it operates through a feeling of responsibility.====We want to acknowledge two limitations of the study design. First, we estimate short-term effects of role models. While immediate reactions are important and especially relevant during an acute crisis, it is important to note that effects may vary over time. Second, we use examples of specific examples of behavior that vary across several dimensions. And while we emphasize that the type of behavior we are showing applies to both Republican and Democratic officials, we are using examples of specific politicians for public role models which may be seen as partisan.

Meanwhile, we do not find strong evidence that guilt relates to the same behavior.",".====Conceptually, risk preferences and other regarding preferences (chiefly guilt) should be important factors guiding pandemic behavior. Contracting the virus can lead to both pecuniary (e.g., medical) and non-pecuniary (e.g., pain and worry) losses. Risk aversion may guide people away from environments where the disease can be contracted or increase their engagement in risk-averting activities like sanitizing surfaces and handwashing. At the same time, guilt may guide individuals to the same avoidance behaviors. Research in infectious disease and medical outlets estimate 17.9% to 30.8% of COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic (e.g. ====; ====). ==== estimate that the majority of infections may be caused by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Consequently, socializing or frequenting congested retail establishments creates the opportunity for ====We present the results from a survey administered to a nationally representative subject pool in the United States. Embedded in the survey are replications of cash-incentivized risk preference and inequity aversion parameter elicitation tasks often used in laboratories. From these we estimate subject-level coefficients of relative risk aversion and of the marginal disutility from advantageous inequality (the so called “guilt” parameter from ==== model of inequality aversion). Then, using questions on subjects’ current and past behavior during the pandemic (visiting a grocery in person, using curbside grocery pickup, dining in at a restaurant, carrying out from a restaurant, handwashing, disinfecting, and socializing) we build a panel dataset which allows us to test for relationships between risk-reducing behavior, risk aversion, and guilt. We find that higher levels of risk aversion are associated with risk-reducing behaviors: increased handwashing, decreased dining in at restaurants, decreased carrying out at restaurants, and decreased socializing. We do not find strong evidence that guilt explains COVID behavior.====Our results are important on two dimensions: experimental economics methodology and policy opportunities. The methodological contribution of this paper regards the external validity of economic experiments, particularly with regards to the application of individual preference measurements. A collection of experimental economics critiques from ====, ====, ====, and ====) raised concern on whether lab results could be extrapolated to the real world.====For example, as ==== suggest, the small monetary stakes typically used within the lab may frustrate the generalizability of results to real-world scenarios with higher stakes. In this study, risk preferences were elicited with choices between $5 or a gamble with two possible payoffs: $0 and $11. Similarly, social preferences were created after subjects made decisions over how to divide $10. But risk-taking during the COVID-19 pandemic involved the chance of hospitalization or even loss of life (own or others). We find, despite the potentially large discrepancy in the stakes of our laboratory tasks and COVID behavior, risk preference measurements align intuitively with pandemic behavior.====We add to an existing methodological literature with mixed results in general regarding external validity, especially in risk and social preference elicitation experiments. Some external-validity work considers the performance of the risk-elicitation mechanisms in explaining other within-lab behaviors. For example, ==== find that both a lottery choice task and a risky investment task perform well in explaining behavior in a competitive game involving uncertain outcomes. A recent paper by ==== also finds that even simple laboratory measures of risk attitudes (as in ====Work on lab-to-field tests of external validity of risk preference measures do not robustly find a correspondence between lab and field behavior. ==== explores the external validity of three methods of risk preference measurement on health and investment decisions. For most of the behaviors they study, no relationship is found. ==== study the external application of risk measures to financial decisions (insurance, employment, and investment decisions) and find no relationship. However, several studies in health economics find a correspondence between the multiple price list mechanism of ==== and risky health behaviors. For example, ==== and ==== conduct an experiment and perform a meta-analysis of the literature. Their experiment finds little evidence that behavior in social preference laboratory experiments predicts behavior in field settings. In their review of the literature they find that less than 40% of the studies in this area report statistically significant relationships between results in the laboratory and results in the field. However, ==== find that subjects who displayed other-regarding behavior in a laboratory experiment were more likely to return money from a misdirected letter mailed weeks after the experiment. Related to the COVID-19 pandemic, ==== follow subjects from a pre-COVID pro-sociality experiment and find that pro-social behavior also drives social distancing behavior, mask-wearing, and shelter-in-place behavior==== show that shelter-in-place orders increased the number of residents in a state who remained in their home full-time by almost 10%. Similarly, ==== find that shelter-in-place orders were effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19.====While overall shelter-in-place policies were effective, policymakers possessed other options to reduce the spread of COVID-19: chiefly, information dissemination.

The existing economic models for disease spread however do not direct a lot of focus on the possible role of pro-social behavior and general trust in predicting preventive behaviors amid the Covid-19. Therefore, this study analyzes whether pro-sociality and general trust measured in the short run (2020 and 2019) and in the long run (2015 and 2010) predict attitudes towards the stay home behavior and the intended stay home behavior in case the government mandates it due to the Covid-19 in the Netherlands. The results suggest that these preferences positively influence attitudes towards staying home behavior. However, trust in comparison to pro-sociality is a stable and robust predictor of stay home attitudes both in the short as well as long run. On the other hand, neither trust nor pro-sociality influences the intended stay home behavior in case the government mandates the lockdown, and it is most likely due to the timing of the survey coinciding with a significant drop in the Covid-19 infections and easing out of the lockdown restrictions by the Dutch government.","The Covid-19 has caused significant damage to the whole world, imposed unprecedented challenges for the medical personnel, general public and governments, and the socioeconomic disruptions continue to massively plague most countries. It has been largely established now that the Covid-19 spreads through droplets with a transmission rate varying from 2.24 to 3.58 (====). Preventive strategies and mitigation measures that include but are not limited to staying home and avoiding public as well as crowded spaces, frequently washing hands and wearing mask have been touted as effective tools to mitigate the rapidly surging virus cases (====).====; ====; ====; ==== and others). The Covid-19 experience so far from countries like Japan and Sweden where most people followed the Covid-19 preventive and mitigation measures despite no strict lockdowns reflects the role of social preferences in health behaviors. Contrarily, several existing studies suggest that when people are uncertain about social impact of their own actions, they tend to use this uncertainty as a justification to behave selfishly (====; ====; ====). Therefore, there is a possibility that selfish behavior might triumph other regarding preferences and people might not follow the Covid-19 preventive measures that can ultimately lead to a surge in virus infections and a strain on the health systems.====The health economics literature modeling the epidemiological diseases has rarely considered the effect of social preferences in predicting the health behaviors (==== find that pro-sociality predicts preventive behavior in Sweden, ==== report that pre-pandemic trust in policy makers influences social mobility in Europe, ==== find that risk and time preferences predict the Covid-19 preventive behaviors in Germany, ==== report a positive relation between pro-sociality and preventive measures in Germany and ==== report that civic capital in both Europe and the US is linked to social distancing. Similarly, ==== find positive influence of pro-sociality on intentions to get vaccinated in China.==== Also, people in the Netherlands have shown strong opposition to the lockdown policies and police force has been used to disperse large crowds protesting against these measures.==== The unwillingness of Dutch people to accept lockdown measures provides an important context to examine whether and how social preferences can be used to nudge the Dutch people to stay home, prevent the spread of virus and ease load on the health and economic systems. Due to these reasons, I focus on the staying home preventive measures in the current study.====Theoretically, prosocial people might care more about the repercussions of their actions on others and therefore follow the Covid-19 preventive and mitigation strategies to minimize negative externalities of their actions. Similarly, the observance of preventive measures can depend on the interpersonal trust (====). Higher trust in others might lead an individual to have positive expectations that others will follow the stay home recommendations and reduce public crowding.==== As a result, citizens are likely to observe the norm of staying home when they expect others will also follow the norm (====; ====). The existing research also suggests that trust plays a positive role in developing useful partnerships among communities to collectively respond to epidemics and to accept the efficacy of strategies designed to counter future emergencies (====; Ryan et at., ====; ====).====The analysis offers weak evidence that pro-sociality measured in the short-term (2019) and in the long-term (2015) predicts attitude towards the appropriateness of staying home in case of virus symptoms only. On the other hand, trust measured in the short-term (2020 and 2019) as well as in the long-term (2015 and 2010) is positively associated to the attitude towards the appropriateness of staying home in case of virus symptoms as well as in case of no virus symptoms. Neither pro-sociality nor trust measured in the short or long-run predict the intended staying home behavior in case the government mandates it. The absence of relation between preferences and the intended stay home behavior is primarily due to the survey timing that coincided with a significant drop in the Covid-19 cases and the easing out of lockdown restrictions in the Netherlands. Overall, the results offer relatively strong support that trust in comparison to pro-sociality is a stable and better predictor of attitude towards the voluntary staying home behavior in the Netherlands.====The study makes several important contributions to the literature. First and foremost, it uses pro-sociality and trust measured in 2015 and 2010 well before the Covid-19 to examine the long-term role of preferences in predicting health behaviors. To the best of knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to examine the actual long-term relationship between preferences and preventive behavior and subsequently unravels the possible application of social preferences in predicting health behaviors in the long run.====Second, the study reports a comparative analysis to identify whether pro-sociality or trust is a better predictor of health behavior. This comparative analysis provides enough evidence to suggest that trust is a better and stable predictor of health behaviors in the Netherlands and highlights the relative applicability of trust in the health economics domain. It is however important to note that the measurement tools for the prosocial behavior and general trust are not comparable; the former is based on donations in the last 12 months while the latter is elicited through a ====. Also, prosocial behavior is indirectly measured through donations while trust is measured through a direct question. These differences in the operationalization of prosocial behavior and trust might influence their effectiveness in predicting the health behaviors and this is a shortcoming of the current study.==== also use a similar design to control for the possible endogeneity, but for pre-pandemic analysis, the authors use pro-sociality measured in 2018. As preferences can be influenced by personal and professional experiences (====; ====) and hence their strength can change over time, preferences measured right before the pandemic are ideal to perform the current analysis because they minimize the time window for the effect of such experiences. Considering this concern, my design is more refined because I use preferences data obtained through same instruments in 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (post-pandemic).====Lastly, this study adds to the growing pandemic literature that examined the role of prosocial behavior and interpersonal or institutional trust to study the Covid-19 preventive and mitigation behaviors (for example: ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ==== and others).====The rest of the study is organized as follows. ==== reports data and statistical analysis details. ==== discusses the results while last section concludes the paper with relevant discussions.",Does pro-sociality or trust better predict staying home behavior during the Covid-19?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804322000982,12 August 2022,2022,Research Article,61.0

Job satisfaction is modelled to take into account the income level of the average educated individual as the reference type, toward which educated individuals compare themselves. We show that, provided that the cost of social comparison is not too strong, the average ability of educated individuals falls with assortative matching, since more low ability students are willing to attend university for marital reasons.

In our experimental setting subjects are involved in two main activities: performing a real-effort task for multiple rounds and deciding on whether to try to obtain an innovation in the real-effort task. The decision to innovate has been designed as a matter of solving a creative task or playing a lottery. If the subjects were successful in solving the creative task or winning the lottery, they obtained a simplified version of the real-effort task, which is to say that they successfully implemented an innovation. We also elicited the subjects’ risk attitudes and their self-perceived creativity. We found that risk-taking attitudes were positively correlated with the willingness to innovate only when the outcome of the decision to innovate was determined by the lottery. On the other hand, there was no significant effect of either self-perceived creativity or risk-taking attitudes on the willingness to innovate when the innovation outcome was the result of solving a creative task. However, self-perceived creativity was positively correlated with the likelihood of solving the creative task successfully.

Tax morale is a positive attitude toward taxation shaped by extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, including numerous psychological factors. However, these factors are far from completely clear and a better understanding of what drives tax morale can greatly help governments in the design of tax policies and their administration. In this paper we test the novel hypothesis that life satisfaction is one of the psychological aspects affecting tax morale. Using longitudinal data from the World Value Survey, we show that people more satisfied with their own life show higher tax morale. We also provide evidence on the roles played by confidence in government and people's cultural orientation in shaping the relationship between life satisfaction and tax morale.

Interaction of reward and punishment sensitivity increased partner-deception in a loss frame, whereas the interaction reduced selfish choice in the dictator control, with negative mood and reward sensitivity as a deterrent of selfish choice in loss control.

The literature suggests that bad outcomes that result from abnormal actions cause more regret than similar outcomes that follow normal actions. In addition, a prior bad outcome makes changes more normal whereas a prior good outcome makes changes less normal. This leads to the hypothesis that following past success of a strategy, the manager will be more inclined to retain it. Surprisingly, this hypothesis is not supported by the data: information about the strategy's past outcome does not affect how likely it is to be continued.

The findings of the study provide implications to increase financial optimism during the pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the global economy. Unemployment in America peaked at 15% in 2020, and there are around 14 million unemployed individuals as of August 2020 (====). The US GDP has declined by 5% during the first quarter of 2020 (====). The pandemic has caused a substantial economic crisis; there is uncertainty about when the crisis would end though vaccines are now available (====). Further, all individuals are not equally affected by the pandemic. Low-income individuals have faced severe adverse consequences, whereas the well-to-do individuals have benefitted from this crisis. However, overall negative sentiment and the economic crisis due to the pandemic are likely to reduce peoples’ optimistic future expectations (====; ====). According to the Michigan Consumer Sentiment index, a delay in expenditure occurs when at the same time individuals’ pessimistic view dominates their optimism about the economic prospects (====). Hence, restricting the decline in optimism has substantial implications for both individuals and society. Financial optimism is different from trait optimism (a generalized view of life) and focuses on a specific situation, which is the financial situation in the present study (====). Optimists put higher weights on desirable outcomes and least weight on unwanted results. Financial optimism helps prepare for the desirable distant future and motivates to act favourably for one's future financial self (Puri and Robinson, 2007). Financial optimism drives household consumption, saving, and investment decisions and helps one achieve financial well-being (====). Hence, financial optimism plays an essential role in economic recovery caused due to the pandemic.====The economic fallout has severely affected the financial conditions of individuals. People are more financially vulnerable (====), less tolerant of financial risk (====), and unprepared to withstand financial shocks (====). As a result, individuals may become financially fragile and not have an ability to meet heavy future expenses (====). Financially fragile individuals are less resilient in the present economic crisis (====). During financial difficulties, financially fragile people are more likely to indulge in ruminating about the misfortune to explain bad experiences and build negative future expectations (====). We argue that individuals currently facing financial difficulty or experiencing financial fragility would have lesser optimistic future expectations. In other words, financial fragility during COVID-19 would reduce financial optimism.====Prior studies are inconsistent: scholars found a negative correlation (Hasler et al., 2018) or no correlation (====) between financial fragility and financial literacy. Hence, there may be other factors that moderate the above linkage. In the present study we considered financial literacy as an important moderating factor. To produce accurate financial forecasts, individuals need to minimize their uncertainty in an unbiased manner (Nofsinger, 2005). Therefore, in the absence of domain-specific knowledge such as literacy in financial matters, it is possible to indulge in the unwarranted extrapolation of recent (unfavorable) trends (====; ====). Therefore, we argue that financial literacy would help regulate the adverse impact of negative sentiments on financial optimism during the pandemic. Moreover, financially literate people save more for retirement (====), better portfolio diversification and returns (====), low debt (====), and lower cost of borrowings (====). As a result, they are prepared to meet future uncertainty, such as the COVID-19.====Scholars agree that women, in general, are less optimistic as compared to men. For example, women are less optimistic about the presidential elections (====), online shopping experience (====), marriage expectations (====), and economic conditions and personal finances (====). The difference between men's and women's optimism lies in the different explanatory styles (====). In general, women attribute their problems to internal, pervasive, and permanent reasons, which is a more pessimistic explanatory style (====). Scholars agree that women are more likely to experience depression than men (====In the present study, we used nationally representative data of more than 2500 American respondents to examine the above hypotheses after controlling for predictors that may potentially explain financial optimism, such as socioeconomic status and trait optimism (====; Puri and Robinson, 2007). We contribute to the literature and find that financially fragile individuals have 7% lower chances of being financially optimistic than financially non-fragile individuals during the pandemic. Further, we find that financial literacy mitigates this negative impact of fragility on optimism. In a gender-based sub-sample analysis, we found that the adverse effect of financial fragility on financial optimism is significant only among women. Our findings have practical implications because financial literacy and gender-based differences explain an individual's future financial expectations, especially in a situation when financial fragility is high.====Appendix A.1 reports a detailed description of all the variables used in the study and their source of respective UAS survey waves.",Financial fragility and financial optimism linkage during COVID-19: Does financial literacy matter?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804321000914,25 July 2021,2021,Research Article,169.0

Induction of reactive guilt was found to increase non-religious participants’ product ratings, but to decrease ratings among those with a religious affiliation. These findings suggest that the monastic attribute is not universally desirable despite that monastic, organic, and local producers share many of the same ethical principles. These results also underscore potentially important heterogeneity in moral cleansing behaviors by religious identity. The potential for religious identity to affect moral balancing has important implications for the study of pro-social and pro-environmental behavior, broadly, and ethical consumption, more specifically.

However, studies on the impact of eye cues on prosocial behavior in economic games yield ambiguous findings and thus provide no clear answer to the question whether these nudges have the potential to cause significant behavioral change. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of watchful eyes remain unclear. We investigate whether cues of being watched positively affect prosocial behavior in the dictator game when a recipient is physically present. In a post-experimental questionnaire, we gathered additional information on attitudes towards trust and voluntary cooperation and on emotional responses to eye images. The weak effect observed in our study suggests that images of human eyes may increase cooperative behavior in the dictator game, providing support for the idea that the ‘watchful eyes effect’ is caused by a concern for avoiding bad reputation. Individual differences in attitudes towards trust and voluntary cooperation did not account for this effect. Furthermore, data from our post-experimental questionnaire provided mixed support for the theory that the watchful eyes effect may ultimately stem from higher levels of negative emotions related to the feeling of being watched caused by the exposure to human eye images. While we found no difference in the positive or negative affect schedule (PANAS) related to eye images and flowers after a long exposure during the experiment, participants in the control group associated lower levels of pleasure and a more dominant feeling (SAM) with the eye images after a short exposure to both stimuli.

Using a novel paradigm, and scaled goods, we obtain valuations of three nonmarket goods: one private (Health), and two public (Environment). We systematically explore the effects on gain-loss asymmetry of Good-type (Public vs. Private), Method (Price vs. Choice), and Payment Units (absolute valuation vs. percentage of income). Across methods, gain-loss asymmetry varies by Good-type: it is larger for public goods. We also find that gain-loss asymmetry shrinks, but does not disappear, from Price to Choice. We identify the mechanism of this shrinkage: a bidirectional, asymmetric valuation shift in Gain and in Loss. Eliciting valuations via income percentages instead of absolute values, and reversing the Price/Choice sequence, preserves these effects. Valuations show less variability when elicited as income percentages than when elicited as absolute values.

Using scenarios, we described different situations occurring in the process of paying taxes in a between-subjects design. Results show that the scenarios elicit specific emotion patterns. Relevant emotions can be clustered into four groups: positive emotions, anger, fear, and self-blame. Future compliance intentions are higher if experiences with the tax authorities are positive rather than negative. This effect is partly mediated by specific emotions. Especially emotions related to anger and self-blame shape compliance intentions. While anger seems to play a more important role in Austria than in Italy, we see that positive emotions and emotions related to feelings of self-blame have a similar impact in both countries.

The first source causes biases due to prior assumptions about the levels of control; the second source generates biased Bayesian processing, due to exerting some degree of control and thus having engagement in the process that generates outcomes. The illusion of control (IOC) phenomenon is re-examined by means of comparison with a proposed decision model using elements of Bayesian updating. In this paper we consider an agent that for a certain period of time is limited to merely observing, yet for another period of time also may control the results of a random process (a series of successes and failures). Namely, an agent may observe the frequency of successes in both cases: when merely observing a process without any degree of control and also when controlling the process. Agents have prior beliefs about their degree of control over the probability of a successful outcome. The agent under consideration is assumed to be ==== in nature, as understood by the following assertions. We assume that an agent uses a Bayesian updating process to take into account the prior beliefs when asked about the perceived probabilities of success - when simply observing the process and when actually controlling it. However, we weaken the assumption about perfect rationality by assuming that the perceived probability of success may be further biased by exerting some measure of control over the process (but not when only observing the process). In our paper we propose an analytical method for identifying this part of the observed IOC which is caused by the prior beliefs held by such an agent.====The main outcome of the paper is a proposed modified measure of illusion of control. The main idea behind this modification is to compare the perceived level of control with the real measure of control as modified by prior beliefs (of the assumed partly rational agent), instead of only comparing it with an unmodified measure of real control, as described in the literature. The application of such a method provides new insights into the phenomenon of illusion of control.

We institute field experiments of an ISD game (ISDG) and conduct qualitative deliberative analysis in rural and urban societies of Nepal. A sequence of six generations, each composed of three people, is organized, and each generation is asked to choose whether to maintain intergenerational sustainability (sustainable option) or maximize their payoff by irreversibly imposing costs on future generations (unsustainable option) in the ISDG. Each generation conducts a discussion lasting up to 10 min before making their decision, thereby enabling the deliberative analysis of the ISD. The qualitative deliberative analysis shows that the attitudes and concepts, such as ideas, motivations and reasons, that people discuss during the deliberation vary between urban and rural people. A considerable portion of urban people are identified as “stable” “influencers” who consistently argue for supporting unsustainable options, while another considerable portion of urban people are identified as “dependent” “conditional followers” who follow the influencers, and rural people do not show such tendencies. Moreover, urban subjects discuss more arguments regarding not considering future generations during their deliberations than do rural people, thereby leading urban generations to more frequently choose unsustainable options.

We assess whether offering simple financial guidance can help households meet their debt obligations by administering a field experiment that provided debt management tips to LMI tax filers after tax filing.

We then use detailed pitch-level data from the 2008–2017 seasons to estimate the effects of pulling the starter on both runs allowed in the current inning and on win probability.

We find that the estimated effect of pulling the starter on runs allowed in the current inning is indeed negative, but the effect on win probability is a precise zero. We examine a variety of game situations and recent events, and find only scattered and limited evidence of biases, but note that statistical power is limited for these analyses. We interpret the results to imply that, at least on average, decisions for when to pull starters were approximately Bayesian-optimal in between plate appearances due to a period of institutional learning that occurred over decades.

We find respondents have much lower social discount rates than those that are generally used in analysis (0.22%; 95% range: 0.15-0.35%), and that respondents distinguish between marginal value and “retention value,” where the latter is the value of retaining at least a token functioning example of a system.

For example, restaurant customers may face implicit tip requests from a parking valet, lounge musician, bartender, hostess, sommelier, waiter, and/or busboy. This raises questions about how the tips given to one worker depend on the performances of their co-workers and/or on the tip amounts previously given to those co-workers. The answers to these questions have implications about the role of affective, self-perception, licensing, and resource budgeting processes in tipping, about the fairness of different tip distribution schemes, and about decisions regarding how many different service workers managers should allow to accept tips. This paper empirically examines these questions for the first time in two natural field experiments conducted by a restaurant magician. Data indicated that: (i) servers got larger tips when the magician performed at their customers’ tables, and (ii) the magician (but not the servers) got substantially more in tips when he gave customers a souvenir card.

To test this conjecture, we compare two elicitation methods, direct response and the strategy method, holding other elements of the game fixed. Existing experimental studies of cheap talk games use the standard direct response method, while the strategy method—in which subjects make selections for all contingent choices—is believed to encourage more thoughtful decisionmaking.

Overall, we show that the elicited contributor types can explain behavior fairly well in the repeated game. Free-rider types contribute less than conditional cooperators, although we observe evidence consistent with strategic cooperation in the early periods of the repeated game. Nevertheless, by the last period, classified free-rider types converge to pure free-riding behavior. In addition, we highlight a potential methodological concern related to the use of control questions. We find that the inclusion of control questions increases (decreases) the proportion of free rider (conditional cooperator) types, but also leads to substantial wait times for many subjects.

Thus, conclusions regarding uncertainty aversion are contingent upon which probability weighting specification is assumed for the source function, and caution should be taken when selecting specifications for the source function.",None,Estimating uncertainty aversion using the source method in stylized tasks with varying degrees of uncertainty,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804318301757,30 September 2019,2019,Research Article,342.0
