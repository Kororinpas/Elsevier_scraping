Using administrative hospital panel data, this paper investigates both short- and long-run impacts of medical malpractice lawsuits on patient medical spending and hospital operations. We find that after the occurrence of an additional malpractice lawsuit in a hospital, total medical spending per patient visit increases by 2.8% in the current year and by as much as 8.8% in the long run. This increase is mainly driven by spending on prescription drugs and diagnostic tests. In response, hospitals invest more in medical devices and procure more drugs. We find little evidence of changes in patient outcomes. Our findings show that the surge of medical malpractice lawsuits leads to defensive medicine and fuels the secular growth of medical spending in China.","China has implemented a series of health system reforms in recent years, such as expanding basic health insurance coverage and establishing a national essential medicine program for primary care (Milcent, 2018). Many improvements have been achieved, yet new challenges emerge. Over the past decade, medical malpractice lawsuits have skyrocketed in China. According to litigation records from China Judgment Online – the official website of China’s Supreme People’s Court – the number of medical malpractice lawsuits has increased more than 100-fold, from less than 100 in 2008 to over 11,000 in 2018 (see Fig. 1).====The soaring number of malpractice lawsuits not only reflects a fast-changing landscape of China’s medical malpractice system, but may result in far-reaching consequences on the entire health system. Because malpractice liabilities are frequently documented to affect physician’s practice patterns and increase medical costs (Kessler et al., 2006, Kessler and McClellan, 1996, Frakes and Gruber, 2019), the steep trajectory of malpractice lawsuits in China may have substantial long-term economic impacts for China’s rapidly expanding healthcare market.==== It is thus extremely policy-relevant to evaluate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of malpractice lawsuits on physician practice, patient health, and medical spending in China, and to inform the policy making in China’s medical tort system. Yet, quantitative evidence on the economic impacts of malpractice lawsuits is lacking in China.====The literature on malpractice lawsuit and provider behaviors is large but focuses on the developed economies. The general consensus is that malpractice litigations, or the risk of it, have substantial impacts on both physicians’ defensive practices and the cost of medical care (Kessler and McClellan, 1996, Danzon, 2000, Studdert et al., 2005).==== In the US, the annual cost of the overuse of tests and procedures that arise from the physicians’ avoidance of malpractice litigation is estimated to be $46 billion or more (Mello et al., 2010, Rothberg et al., 2014, Chandra et al., 2013). Carrier et al. (2010) find that physicians’ fears of malpractice lawsuits are not assuaged by tort reforms that reduce the financial burden of malpractice lawsuits, suggesting substantial non-pecuniary cost of malpractice lawsuits for physicians. Although existing evidence suggests that malpractice lawsuits can change the physician’s practice style and lead to long-run consequences, few studies have systematically estimated the ==== economic impacts of malpractice lawsuits.====Causal analysis of the malpractice lawsuit’s impact on hospital responses faces two important challenges in China’s context. First, as in most healthcare markets, the occurrence of a malpractice case is endogenous. Both the risk of malpractice and the likelihood of patient’s filing a lawsuit may correlate with unobservable characteristics of the local tort system, medical providers, patients, and the interactions of the three, which engenders omitted variable bias. To deal with this endogeneity issue, a common practice is to exploit the exogenous change in the cost or the risk of malpractice lawsuits generated by tort reforms that vary across locations and time, and compare the reform-affected group of providers against unaffected or less affected groups over time (see, for example, Kessler and McClellan (1996)). Such a practice that derives exogenous variations in malpractice lawsuits from region-specific tort reforms is infeasible in China’s context, because tort reforms are implemented at the national or provincial level (see Section 2.2) and a longitudinal dataset of hospitals across multiple provinces is unavailable in China. On the other hand, without exogenous variation in the local tort system, it is difficult to find external factors that change the likelihood of malpractice lawsuits but do not otherwise directly affect provider behaviors and patient outcomes.====Second, hospital decision making is dynamic in nature for Chinese hospitals. Most of hospital operational outcomes, such as hospital employment, are serially correlated. This is because most hospitals are public and health professionals – such as doctors and nurses – are public-sector employees (Milcent, 2018). Hiring and firing of hospital employees are thus costly and hospital’s procurement of high-end medical equipments is subject to a long process of application and approval with the state regulators (Zhen, 2011).==== As a result, we expect hospitals’ outcomes to adjust with delay and depend on the previous year’s value, which argues for a dynamic model, in which the lagged value of a hospital outcome is an important determinant of its current level. However, if we apply an ordinary least squares (OLS) approach with hospital fixed effects to model this dynamic process, i.e., through first-differencing or within transformation, one immediate problem is that the transformed lagged outcome variable is correlated with the transformed error term, which gives rise to the “dynamic panel bias” (Nickell, 1981, Arellano and Bover, 1995).====We adopt the system generalized method of moments (GMM) to address both challenges (Blundell and Bond, 1998, Arellano and Bover, 1995). We estimate a dynamic panel-data model by regressing the hospital outcome variable on the lagged outcome variable and the number of malpractice lawsuits. The system GMM estimates two equations simultaneously: In the ==== equation, all variables are first differenced across years, and the higher-order lagged outcome variable and lagged number of lawsuits as used as instruments. In the ==== equation, the first-differenced lagged outcome variable and the number of lawsuits are used as instruments. Both ==== and ==== equations control for year fixed effects and hospital fixed effects. Blundell and Bond (1998) demonstrate that system GMM estimators are consistent and robust, especially when the outcome variable is highly persistent. Overall, with the system GMM, we can consistently estimate both the contemporaneous effects of malpractice lawsuits and the degree of serial correlation of outcome variables. Combining these two estimates, we compute the long-run effects of malpractice lawsuits on outcomes of interest, including medical spending, hospital operations, and patient outcomes.====We obtain a unique administrative longitudinal dataset of hospital annual reports in Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan province, from 2009 to 2014. The hospital annual reports are collected and audited by the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The annual report is thus based on a uniform data standard. It represents a hospital’s year-end balance sheet and contains three categories of hospital metrics: the volume of patient visits and medical spending, hospital financial statement and operational metrics, and a limited set of patient health outcomes. A unique variable that makes this study feasible is the number of medical malpractice lawsuits occurred in each hospital in a given year. To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset in China that provides official records of the number of malpractice lawsuits at the hospital level. With this dataset, we assess the following research questions: Does the increase in malpractice lawsuits leads to higher medical spending and changes in provider behaviors in China? If yes, how large is the effect in both short and long run, and through what channel does it affect physician practice, hospital operations, and patient outcomes?====Our estimation results show that one additional malpractice lawsuit (against an average of 0.2 cases per hospital per year) leads to an average of 2.8% increase in total medical spending per patient visit in the short run and 8.8% increase in the long run. To break down spending into outpatient and inpatient components, we find the short-run increase in outpatient spending per outpatient visit is 3.0% and that in inpatient spending per admission is 2.5%. Both estimates are statistically significant at the 5% level. The corresponding long-run increases are higher – 8.1% and 12.9%, respectively – and are statistically significant at the 5% level. The increase in medical spending is most pronounced in prescription drugs and diagnostic tests, which are above 2.6% in both outpatient and inpatient settings in the short run, and above 9.6% in the long run. By contrast, the spending increases in general care, consultation services, and surgeries are close to zero and statistically insignificant. Consistent with the pattern of spending increases, we find hospitals invest more in high-end diagnostic devices and procure more prescription drugs in response to the increases in malpractice lawsuits, and with statistically significantly estimated long-run effects. We find little evidence of changes in patient outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest medical malpractice lawsuits motivate medical providers to practice defensive medicine, which fuels the secular growth of medical spending in China.====Our study contributes to the literature on medical malpractice lawsuits and the associated impacts on the health system. The existing research has found medical malpractice liability leads to the practice of defensive medicine and increases medical cost (Mello et al., 2010, Baicker et al., 2007, Kessler, 2011, Kessler and McClellan, 1996, Kessler et al., 2006, Frakes and Gruber, 2019). In particular, Kessler and McClellan (1996) find malpractice reforms in the US in the 1980s that directly reduced provider’s malpractice liability led to a reduction in medical spending of 5% to 9% without substantial effects on mortality or medical complications. Existing studies focus almost exclusively on developed countries; our research provides the first piece of evidence on the economic impact of malpractice lawsuits in China, and assess the channels through which providers adjust their medical practices. Considering the surge in malpractice lawsuits in recent years, our findings on the substantive long-run effects of lawsuits on medical spending and providers’ defensive responses have critical implications for policymaking in China’s healthcare and medical-legal system.====Our analysis of both short- and long-run effects of malpractice lawsuits adds to the understanding of the consequences of medical malpractice in the healthcare system. We adopt the system GMM method to overcome the challenges of dynamic panel bias and endogeneity bias and estimate the long-run effect of malpractice lawsuits. We demonstrate that many hospital outcome variables are strongly serially correlated, and if not dealt with, such serial correlation in the outcome variable will make the estimation inconsistent in conventional static fixed-effects estimation (Arellano and Bover, 1995). Having accounted for both the serial correlation of outcome variables and the endogeneity of malpractice lawsuits, we find long-run effects of malpractice lawsuits on medical spending are substantially higher than short-run effects, suggesting that prior estimates of the contemporaneous effect of malpractice liability may underestimate its overall fiscal impact. Our finding highlights the long-run implication of malpractice liability for the financial sustainability of the health system as medical costs are rising dangerously in China, US, and many other countries.====We proceed as follows. Section 2 describes the background of the Chinese health system and the judicial system for medical malpractice lawsuits. Section 3 describes the data source and presents the summary statistics. Section 4 describes the system GMM methodology. Section 5 presents estimation results on the short- and long-run effects of malpractice lawsuits, and evidence on defensive medicine. Section 6 conducts robustness checks. Section 7 discusses the policy implications of our findings and concludes.",The short- and long-run effects of medical malpractice lawsuits on medical spending and hospital operations in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596723000495,Available online 14 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

This study uses a novel dataset and an event study approach to evaluate the economic consequences of international sanctions, thereby visualizing pre-treatment and treatment dynamics in countries subject to sanctions. Our analysis focuses on the effects of sanctions on GDP growth as well as on various transmission channels through which sanctions suppress economic activity. We document a significant negative effect of sanctions on the growth rate of GDP and its components (consumption and investment) as well as on trade and foreign direct investment. Given that sanctions exert their adverse effect over the first years of a sanction episode and that sanctioned countries fail to recover during or immediately after the episode, we demonstrate the usefulness of sanctions as a political instrument of coercion. Long-lasting sanctions regimes, however, may not provide the political incentives needed to force additional concessions.","International sanctions are one of the most widely used instruments of coercion in international politics. Since the end of World War II, Aidt et al. (2021) count more than 1400 incidents of states being threatened with or targeted by sanctions. The use of sanctions has dramatically increased since the end of the Cold War with the US–China trade war being the most recent escalation between economic superpowers. Sanctions are supposed to inflict economic harm in order to force the target country to change its policies. In fact, Hufbauer et al. (2009) show that sanctions are more likely to be successful the harder the target country’s economy is hit. Thus, detailed knowledge of the economic effects of sanctions is essential to understanding if and how sanctions are able to achieve their goals and what is the price paid by target country populations.====The limited empirical evidence concerning the economic effects of international sanctions on target countries suggests that sanctions trigger financial crises (Hatipoglu and Peksen, 2018, Peksen and Son, 2015) and reduce income per capita (Neuenkirch and Neumeier, 2015). Reductions in trade (Afesorgbor, 2019, Crozet and Hinz, 2020, Felbermayr et al., 2020b, Gutmann et al., 2022), international capital flows (Besedeš et al., 2017), and foreign direct investment (Biglaiser and Lektzian, 2011, Mirkina, 2018) are likely transmission channels, but both can be undermined by sanction busters (Barry and Kleinberg, 2015, Early, 2015, Haidar, 2016, Haidar, 2017, Lektzian and Biglaiser, 2013). Recent evidence from Iran shows that sanctions can successfully target politically connected entities within a country (Draca et al., 2023). The effect of sanctions on the informal economy appears to be ambiguous (Early and Peksen, 2019, Farzanegan and Hayo, 2019). Sanctions can also be costly to the sender country, as illustrated by the sanctions against Russia after its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 (Bělín and Hanousek, 2021, Crozet and Hinz, 2020, Gullstrand, 2020, Kholodilin and Netšunajev, 2019) or against China after the Tiananmen Square Incident in 1989 (Webb, 2020).====This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the economic effects of international sanctions based on a panel-data event study design. The main goal of our study is to systematically evaluate the growth effects of sanctions, including their effects on different components and proximate causes of GDP. Our research design has the advantage that empirical estimates can be plotted in intuitive graphs based on a straightforward econometric approach. These graphs show dynamic post-treatment effects and allow testing the identifying assumption of parallel pre-event trends in the treatment and control group (Schmidheiny and Siegloch, 2023). In this sense, we are providing new evidence that the measured economic effects of sanctions are causal and not mere correlations. Another added value is that we can pinpoint the timing of economic effects over the course of a sanction episode. A similar empirical approach is used by Berger et al. (2013) to show that CIA interventions during the Cold War increased trade flows from the US to target countries.====The event study approach advances our understanding of the causal treatment effects of sanctions. We employ it not only to economic growth rates, but also to a range of potential transmission channels, which are studied as alternative dependent variables. Unlike previous studies that might have focused on one of these dependent variables, we evaluate the transmission channels based on a uniform empirical framework that ensures a reasonable identification of causal effects, which are comparable among each other and cannot result from carefully selected model specifications. Moreover, we employ a novel dataset of international sanctions with unprecedented data quality as well as country- and time-coverage (Felbermayr et al., 2020a, Kirikakha et al., 2021). This dataset features far more cases than any other sanctions database. In sum, we are providing new and compelling evidence for the economic effects of sanctions that lends itself to a causal interpretation. Our evidence is not limited to measuring the effect on income per capita, but we are also trying to illustrate how this effect is brought about.====Our key results are as follows: We document a significant negative effect of international sanctions on GDP growth and its components (consumption and investment) as well as on trade and foreign direct investment. We are confident that our findings can be interpreted as causal, since we do not observe an economic downturn in the years before the imposition of sanctions, indicating that the adverse economic effects we measure mark a significant deviation from the country’s pre-trend.==== The estimated effects are economically relevant, as an average target country’s GDP per capita, for instance, declines by 2.8 percent over the first two years of a sanction episode and it does not recover, even within the first three years after sanctions are lifted.==== Additional panel difference-in-differences (DiD) estimations reveal that the adverse economic effects were particularly prevalent during the Cold War and that they are driven by US unilateral sanctions and financial sanctions. Finally, governments react politically to sanctions and specifically democracies increase the share of their total government expenditures that is spent on the military.====The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 provides some theoretical considerations regarding the economic effects of sanctions. Section 3 describes our empirical approach, which closely follows the event study design of Schmidheiny and Siegloch (2023) and complements it with standard panel DiD estimations to evaluate effect heterogeneity. Moreover, we discuss the data employed in our empirical analysis with an emphasis on the novel sanctions dataset collected by Felbermayr et al. (2020a) and Kirikakha et al. (2021). In Section 4, we present our empirical results and discuss them in light of the extant evidence in the literature. We start by evaluating the growth effects of sanctions, before moving on to potential transmission channels.

The cumulative fiscal multipliers of military expenditures estimated using the Local Projections method take values 0.6 on impact, 1.5–1.6 in the second and in the third year after shock and gradually decrease in subsequent years. They are higher during recession periods. Personnel military expenditures have relatively the highest multipliers among disaggregated military expenditures. Other military expenditures have positive, but lower than unity multipliers, while the multipliers of military equipment purchases are insignificant and close to zero. Cumulative multipliers of military expenditures during military build-up after the outbreak of the war in Donbas were lower than cumulative multipliers in the whole sample.","After the end of the Cold War, the countries of the Central and Eastern Europe experienced a period of peace and relative security, sometimes referred to as ""peace bonus"" or ""peace dividend,"" additionally strengthened by the accession of the said countries into NATO in 1999 and 2004. The median level of military expenditure of nine countries of the so-called NATO's Eastern Flank decreased from 1.84% of GDP in 2003 to 1.02% of GDP in 2013. The unrecognized annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas significantly changed the attitude of authorities and societies to increasing military expenditures. Since that time, military expenditures have continued to grow year by year, reaching 1.95% in 2021.====Russia's aggression against Ukraine in 2022 forced further significant increases of military expenditures. At the end of 2022, NATO reported that military expenditures of the whole alliance in 2023 were expected to grow by 25.8% year-over-year. Such high and never seen before increases of military expenditures in the countries in the region raise an urgent question to researchers, policy-makers and forecasters about the effect of such expenditures on the economies of the countries in the region. Allocating resources to the military is not neutral to the economy, and it is necessary to investigate this influence. One of the main motivations of this article is an intention to study the short-run effects of military expenditures on the GDP changes of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (hereinafter: CEE). So far, there have been few works concerning the region, making this work a significant contribution to the literature.====In order to study the short-run effects of military expenditures on GDP change, this article presents the results of an estimation of fiscal multipliers based on the Impulse Response Function generated using the Local Projections method (Jordà 2005). The results show that the cumulative fiscal multipliers of military expenditures equal 0.6 on impact, 1.5–1.6 in the second and the third years, and begin to fall gradually to zero in subsequent years. In line with previous studies, the fiscal multipliers of military expenditures are higher during recessions. The exchange rate regime does not affect substantially the value of fiscal multipliers in the CEE countries. The fiscal multipliers of military build-up expenditures after the war in Donbas broke out were close to 1 on impact, and then gradually decreased to zero in subsequent years.====Furthermore, this article presents an analysis of the short-run effects of disaggregated military expenditures from Eurostat databases on GDP in order to identify the most important channels of influence of military burdens on GDP. The estimation results suggest that military expenditures on personnel had the largest influence on the value of the fiscal multiplier of total military expenditures. The values of the multiplier of military personnel expenditures are the highest from among the three categories of disaggregated military expenditures. Other military expenditures have positive, but lower than unity values of the fiscal multiplier, while expenditures on equipment purchases have statistically insignificant and close to zero values.====The rest of the article is organised as follows: Section 2 presents a review of literature concerning the short-run effects of military expenditures on output and fiscal multipliers of military expenditures.

The reform relaxes the Hukou restrictions in the Gaokao system, allowing eligible migrant children to take the Gaokao in the destination province and be admitted to higher education institutions based on the same criteria as local students. Using the CMDS 2011–2017 dataset and the difference-in-differences approach, we find that the reform significantly increases children's migration probability; the positive effect is weaker in provinces with more stringent requirements. While Gaokao reform does not affect parents’ decisions of cross-province migration or destination of migration, parents’ extend their migration duration.","China has experienced unprecedented rural-urban migration since the early 1980s. During the first decade, most migrants migrated alone, leaving their spouses and children behind in their home villages. As urban employment became more stable in the late 1990s, their spouses and children began to join the migrants in the cities. Children who migrate with their parents are known as migrant children, while those who do not are left-behind children. In 2015, the number of rural migrant children under 17 was approximately 34 million (Lv et al., 2018). China's household registration (Hukou) system, which ties government-provided services including education to a registered location, however, poses a significant obstacle to rural migrant children's access to quality education from primary school to college.====The central government has exerted considerable pressure on local governments to provide compulsory education for migrant children since the early 2000s. In 2001, it issued the “Decision on the Reform and Development of Basic Education,” mandating that governments of the current residence of migrant children be responsible for their compulsory education.==== Since then, continued pressure from the central government has greatly improved the access of migrant children to compulsory education.==== Based on this achievement, some cities started releasing plans in 2003 to allow migrant children to take the high school entrance exam (Zhongkao) and attend local senior high schools (Han, 2021). By 2008, many cities with a large influx of migrant children had announced Zhongkao policies for migrant children (Wu, 2011). In contrast to the progress in migrant children's basic education, the issue of their higher education only started to receive attention in the past decade.====In China, the national college entrance exam (Gaokao) is the dominant means of admissions to tertiary education. However, the Gaokao system, like other public services, is tied to the Hukou, and children are forbidden to take the Gaokao outside of their Hukou place. To solve the Gaokao problem faced by migrant households, in 2012, the State Council issued “Opinions on Enabling Children of Migrant Workers to Take the Entrance Exam in the Place Where Their Parents Work and Live after Compulsory Education” (henceforth, Opinions).==== The “Opinions” urged provincial governments to develop policies to allow eligible migrant children to take the Zhongkao and Gaokao in the province of current residence. While the Zhongkao policies for migrant children have been implemented in some places prior to the “Opinions”, the Gaokao policies were not introduced until after the “Opinions.” Despite differences in eligibility requirements and implementation time, 30 of the 31 provinces had announced Gaokao policies for children of migrant families by 2013.====The reform is expected to give migrant children a fair opportunity in the Gaokao. Before the reform, migrant children had to return to their Hukou province to take the Gaokao, regardless of how long they or their families had lived in the destination province. Adapting to a new school, especially without parental care, is difficult. In addition, the exam content differed across provinces. Relearning the exam materials in a new high school at their hometown may hurt children's performance on this high-stakes exam. Thus, many parents had to leave their secondary school-aged children in their hometown for the entire secondary school stage to avoid the dramatic change and associated negative impacts of transferring schools just before the Gaokao. The Gaokao reform enables eligible migrant children to take the Gaokao in the destination province and get admitted based on the same criteria as local students. Consequently, more migrant parents may be encouraged to bring their children along. In this paper, we investigate how the Gaokao reform affects the migration of children of rural migrant households.====Our primary difference-in-differences analysis compares the change in migration probability of secondary school-aged children after the Gaokao reform was announced to that of pre- and primary school-aged children. Using the China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) data from 2011 to 2017, we find that the Gaokao reform significantly increased the migration probability for all secondary school-aged children. Specifically, after the Gaokao reform was announced, the migration probability of junior and senior secondary school-aged children increased by 2.6 and 4.4 percentage points, respectively, compared to pre- and primary school-aged children. Using a triple-differences approach, we estimate the heterogeneous effect of the Gaokao reform due to policy stringency and find the effect of the Gaokao reform to be greater in provinces with less stringent requirements for Gaokao eligibility. The results are robust to a series of sensitivity analyses and are not driven by various of confounding factors. Additionally, although migrant parents did not change their long-term residence intentions, they nevertheless prolonged their migration duration in the destination province.====This paper is related and contributes to three strands of the literature. The first is the literature on the equity implications of local provision of public education and the role of higher-level governments. Basic education tends to be provided by local governments, in particular in large countries (Glomm et al., 2011), on the premise that local governments can better satisfy the preferences of residents within their jurisdiction (Tiebout, 1956). Yet, locally financed public education may lead to severe inequality due to disparities in financial capacity across regions (Fernández and Rogerson 1999, 2003; Hannum and Wang 2006). Inter-governmental transfers can mitigate this problem. Hoxby, (2001), Card and Payne (2002), and Lafortune et al. (2018), among others, show that school finance equalization reforms in the U.S. has reduced the educational spending gap between wealthy and poor school districts. Since the mid 2000s, the Chinese central government has implemented and gradually expanded earmarked educational transfers to the rural areas, which help narrow the resource gap between urban and rural schools (Li et al., 2017; Yue et al., 2018). However, intergovernmental transfers are insufficient to solve the problem of the inequality of educational opportunities of the migrant children caused by institutional barriers of the Hukou system. Addressing this issue requires additional policy instruments. Our findings indicate that the mandate of the central government led the local governments to develop policies for children of migrant families, which incentivize them to migrate and take advantage of the richer educational resources in the urban area.====Second is the literature investigating the education of rural migrant children. Many studies have observed that migrant children do not have equal access to basic education as local urban children. Urban governments lack the incentive and financial resources to meet the educational needs of migrant children when educational budgets are allocated based on the number of students with local Hukou (Goodburn, 2009; Zhang, 2017; Chen and Feng 2013). They prioritize allocating limited public school resources to local urban children, and migrant children may end up in privately run, low-quality migrant schools (Goodburn, 2016; Lai et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). These studies focused on difficulties faced by migrant children in receiving quality compulsory education. We contribute to the literature by showing that the Gaokao opportunity significantly increased the migration probability of children of migrant families, which may benefit rural children's human capital in two ways. First, migrant children no longer have to return to their Hukou province for the Gaokao, saving the cost of adapting to new schools, curricula, and environments (Hanushek et al., 2004; Rumberger and Larson 1998). Second, children migrating with their parents can avoid the negative impact of being left behind on their human capital accumulation (Antman, 2011; McKenzie and Rapoport 2011; Zhang et al., 2014).====Third, this paper relates to the literature on factors that affect migration. Many studies examine how economic factors such as income gaps, land rights, and wealth constraints affect internal migration decisions (Cai, 2020; Chernina et al., 2014; Dustmann and Okatenko 2014; Phan and Coxhead 2010). Only a few studies pay attention to the role of children in parental migration behavior. Démurger and Xu (2015) find that migrant parents with children in primary schools tend to delay the return to their hometowns. Xie and Zhang (2022) document that mothers are more likely to migrate to urban areas when their children transfer to urban schools following the rural school-merger reform. Wang et al. (2019) relate children's migration to parental settlement intention and show a positive correlation between these two. Our study adds to this literature by investigating how children's educational opportunities influence the migration behavior of their parents. While the Gaokao reform does not appear to affect parents’ decisions of cross-province migration or destination of migration, parents’ do extend their migration duration, consistent with Su et al. (2018) that migration is primarily to improve family economic conditions and with Liu and Xing's (2016) that increasing the availability of educational opportunities will facilitate rural-to-urban migration.====In the remainder of the paper, we first describe the institutional background of the Gaokao reform and lay out the conceptual framework. Section 3 describes the data and empirical strategy. Section 4 reports the effects of the Gaokao reform on children's migration. Section 5 addresses issues of potential confounding factors.

We develop a simple taxation model under asymmetric information to find the Mafia optimal extortion as a function of firms’ observable characteristics, namely size and sector. We test the predictions of the model on a unique dataset on extortion in Sicily, the Italian region where the Sicilian Mafia, one of the most ancient criminal organizations, operates. In line with our theoretical model, our empirical findings show that extortion is strongly concave with respect to firm size and highly regressive. The percentage of profits appropriated by the Mafia ranges from 40% for small firms to 2% for large enterprises. We derive some implications of these findings for market structure and economic development.","Several countries around the world are plagued by the presence of organized crime. This phenomenon appears particularly widespread in some countries from Latin America, the former Soviet bloc, and East Asia (Van Dijk, 2007). Among European countries, Italy stands out as a peculiar case as some regions of the South, namely Sicily, Calabria, Campania and Apulia experience the presence of powerful ==== that still pose a serious threat to their development (see Paoli, 2003, for an introduction to the Italian case). For example, Pinotti (2015) estimates that, in the case of Apulia, in recent years criminal organizations have caused a cumulative loss in GDP of 16%.====The presence of a strong criminal organization in the region is a symptom of institutional weakness. In fact, Mafia-type organizations represent instances of “extra-legal governance” (Gambetta, 1993, Varese, 2014) providing a specific service, protection, which would otherwise be provided by the State. Although the literature on institutional quality and economic development mostly points out cross-country differences (see e.g. Acemoglu et al., 2005 for a comprehensive account of this literature), Italy displays significant cross-regional variation in institutional quality, as highlighted since the work of Putnam et al. (1994). Southern regions, i.e. the ones in which strong criminal organizations appeared and are still widespread, are those characterized by the lowest institutional quality (see the recent work of Acemoglu et al., 2017, for a discussion of the origins of the Sicilian Mafia and of its long-term economic consequences). Indeed, in the case of Russia, Frye and Zhuravskaya (2000) find that institutional weakness coupled with heavy regulation increases the probability that a shop owner has contacts with private protection organizations.====Being a provider of extra-legal governance, Mafias implement their own taxation system. In particular they impose extortion, i.e. the forced extraction of resources, on firms operating in legitimate sectors, under the threat of punishment for non-compliance. In this paper we provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of extortion based on a unique dataset of first-quality data on the exact amounts of ==== paid by a sample of Sicilian firms, matched with data from their financial statements. Our aim is to understand how Mafia establishes the amount of money that businesses are forced to pay on the basis of their characteristics, namely size, and how this relationship varies by sector. In particular, we identify the stylized facts of the relationship between ==== and firm size and sector and then show that they can be accounted for by a taxation model in which the criminal organization cannot perfectly observe firms’ productivity. The main empirical implication of our model, which we test using our dataset, is a concave relationship between firm size and the amount of ==== paid.====Our main findings are the following. The log of ==== moderately increases with the log of firm size: the estimated elasticity of ==== with respect to size is approximately 0.1, which implies a strongly concave relationship between ==== and firm size, characterized by the marginal and average ==== decreasing with size. The elasticities vary by business sector: in some sectors such as construction and transportation the estimated elasticity is higher than the average, taking on values of approximately 0.3. These elasticities show that “Mafia taxation” is highly ====. The quantitative effect of varying business size on average ==== is striking. We find that the average “==== rate”, i.e. the percentage of operating profits appropriated by the Mafia, amounts to approximately 40% for small firms and decreases to approximately 2% for large enterprises.====These findings suggest specific microeconomic channels through which organized crime negatively affects economic growth: (i) by erecting barriers to entry, (ii) by stifling small businesses which, in an environment where access to credit can be difficult because of crime itself,==== have limited resources to expand, and thus (iii) creating the conditions for a poverty trap based on non-convexity in the cost function.====Our work is strongly influenced by the seminal contribution of Schelling (1971) on the economics of organized crime. Specifically, Schelling identifies the characteristics that make a company more vulnerable to the extortion racket. Firms of small size can be easier targets than large corporations as in the former it is easier for the mobster to force the owner to pay. In contrast, in large companies, a ==== would have to wander numerous floors of offices before eventually finding somebody to threat. Furthermore, he points out that companies with more observable profits or revenues can be easier targets of the racket because it would be difficult for such firms to claim an incapacity to meet the extortionary requests. Based of these remarks, we chose to focus on firms’ size and sector when analyzing extortion. However, in this paper we do not study the choice to extort or not extort a specific firm, but rather, given an extorted business, the choice of the amount the Mafia demands given size and sector.====Our work complements the existing literature on the economic analysis of extortion in different respects. A notable contribution is Konrad and Skaperdas (1998), who propose a model of extortion in which costly investment in destructive capacity and asymmetric information on firm value cause the emergence of conflict between the criminal organization and the extorted business, leading to an inefficient destruction of property. In our model, the criminal organization is strong enough to impose compliance on firms that open for business, thus conflict does not arise. On the other hand, we allow the criminal organization to condition the amount of money extorted on observable characteristics correlated with private information (namely size), thus incentive compatibility induces distortion in productive choices and possibly exclusion from the market.====Aleksander (1997) studies the extortion racket in Depression-Era Chicago, where the local Mafia imposed a payment on pasta producers taking the form of a two-part tariff. Exploiting information on the tariff and on local market conditions, she finds that Mafia “taxation” was regressive, as the highest burden from extortion was imposed on companies producing at smaller scales, a result similar to ours. She concludes that the organizational form of the pasta market was of a cartel, in which the criminal organization acted as enforcer (see Gambetta and Reuter, 1995, for a discussion of Mafia cartels).====Olken and Barron (2009) analyze extortion imposed by officers on truck drivers at check-points and weigh stations in Indonesia. They propose a theoretical model of price discrimination and test it on a sample of payments collected at check-points and weigh stations along two Indonesian routes. They show that market structure (measured by the number of check points) influences the payment structure, and that officers practice price discrimination. Our work shares the use of actual data on extortion with theirs. However, the kind of extortion analyzed by Olken and Barron (2009) refers to officers and should be more correctly classified as corruption.==== In the case studied by Olken and Barron (2009) criminal organizations can provide protection to truck drivers along the route against the payment of a quasi-fixed fee. Differently, in our study the focus is on extortion imposed on legal businesses by organized crime, which can price-discriminate among firms based on observable characteristics, such as size.====Interestingly, when Olken and Barron (2009, p. 446) estimate the elasticity of payments at check-points with respect to a measure of cargo value, they find a value of 0.072, which is consistent with the values of the elasticities of ==== to firm size that we estimate in this paper. Furthermore, in a study of extortion by the Russian Mafia, Varese (2001, p. 107) finds that the kiosk owners he interviewed reported paying to the local racket a quasi-fixed amount of protection money, irrespective of what their turnover actually was. The explanation advanced by Varese (2001, p. 107) is that collecting precise information on each individual kiosk would have cost too much to the criminal organization, which consequently found it more convenient to set a quasi-fixed price. Interestingly, Varese (2001, p. 108) finds that in some instances the local Mafia could send an accountant to try to estimate the turnover of a business, to at least partially overcome the asymmetric information problem. These contributions, overall, suggest that the validity of our theoretical framework and empirical findings might extend beyond the case of the Sicilian Mafia.====Being focused on Mafia extortion of legal businesses, our work is also complementary to the theoretical analyses of the case in which the State and the Mafia compete to tax companies, as in the seminal model of Grossman (1995) and in the more recent work of Alexeev et al. (2004). In these articles firms can choose to operate fully or partially in the legal or in the illegal sector, depending on the incentives provided by the State and the Mafia in terms of taxes and provision of public goods. Conversely, in our model the Mafia extorts firms independently of their legal status, under the threat of punishment for non-compliance, rather than following the promise of providing an informal service, and our empirical analysis focuses on legal companies, in particular on businesses that comply with the mandatory registration in official records such as those maintained by the Italian Chamber of Commerce.====Finally, the recent paper by Piemontese (2020) estimates the amounts of ==== paid by firms in Northern Italy and its impact on resource misallocation. Differently from our paper, however, Piemontese (2020) does not observe actual ==== figures. She employs a methodology that allows indirectly estimating sectoral averages under the assumption that ==== is a linear function of revenues, therefore not considering within-sector heterogeneity of percentage ==== payments as we do in this paper.====The paper is organized as follows: inn Section 2 we describe our dataset; in Section 3 we present the stylized facts emerging from the dataset; in Sections 4 The model, 5 Optimal extortion function we describe and solve the basic theoretical model of a monopolistic Mafia optimally choosing extortion as a function of some observable variable; in Section 6 we present the results of the econometric analysis; in Section 7 we offer a discussion on the economics of extortion on the basis of our findings and draw our conclusions.",The economics of extortion: Theory and the case of the Sicilian Mafia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596723000501,Available online 5 June 2023,2023,Research Article,4.0
Abellán Miguel,"Institute of Economics, Leuphana University Lüneburg, Universitätsallee 1, 21335 Lüneburg, Germany","Received 10 February 2021, Revised 13 February 2023, Accepted 17 February 2023, Available online 22 May 2023.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jce.2023.02.004,Cited by (0),"This paper employs data from the World Values Survey (1995–2020) and the European Values Study (1999–2020) to test three hypotheses on attitudinal differences between Catholics, Protestants and Muslims: (1) the ==== which covers attitudes towards work and some fundamental characteristics of the market economy; (2) the ====, which concerns interpersonal trust, ethical standards and attitudes towards gender equality; (3) the ====, which involves attitudes towards democracy and political violence, institutional trust and preferences for government-organized redistribution. The empirical analysis provides very little support for the ==== but solid support for the ==== and ====. Although the results should be ultimately interpreted as partial correlations, they support the following argument. Market forces and the rise of post-materialist values may have dissolved the original role of a work ethic rooted in religion (especially in the Catholic and Protestant world). Yet, the socio-political ethic associated with Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam continues to manifest itself in attitudinal differences concerning interpersonal trust, ethical standards and gender equality, and in political preferences. A complementary analysis of regions with a historically strong influence of Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam supports this argument and suggests that the current attitudinal differences between the three religions are more related to their cultural and historical legacy than to current personal commitment to their specific doctrines.","Different lines of research have challenged the secularization theory and suggested that religion may still explain the persistence of certain socioeconomic outcomes (e.g., Franck and Iannaccone, 2014; Iyer, 2016; Ruiter and van Tubergen, 2009; Stark, 1999). Barro and McCleary (2003), for example, show that religious beliefs foster individual traits conducive to productivity and growth (e.g., frugality), whereas religious participation leads to growth only to the extent that it promotes these productivity-enhancing beliefs. Otherwise, religious participation consumes resources that could have been used for other productive purposes. Barro and McCleary find a negative effect of Islam on growth too, which in line with Kuran (2004) they link to governmental regulations in Muslim countries (e.g., on contracts or corporate ownership). Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott (2015) also find a negative effect of Ramadan on growth, while Noland (2005) finds no evidence of a detrimental character of Islam with respect to growth. On the contrary, he points to increasing institutional and behavioral convergence in the Muslim world to explain the above-average growth of some Muslim countries over the last decades.====While very insightful, these studies are unable to explain how a primarily exogenous but time-invariant factor like religion can account for a dynamic phenomenon like economic growth. Besides the fact that regression analysis with a small sample of countries may confound the effects of religion with other institutional and cultural factors (Durlauf et al., 2012; Young, 2009), a possibly robust link between religion and economic growth at the aggregate level does not explain the mechanisms through which religion may affect this outcome (e.g., political behavior, labor market decisions). At the same time, research on these mechanisms usually refers to specific countries and institutional settings, making a comparison between countries and religions more difficult (e.g., Basten and Betz, 2013; Spenkuch, 2017). Against these challenges, different lines of research, among which the present study is included, prefer to make use of cross-country survey data to study the (persistent) link between religion and attitudes shown to explain socioeconomic outcomes. In this approach, a major assumption is that current religious denomination still provides information on the historical influence of religion because values and preferences with a religious origin remain palpable even when the underpinning religious beliefs and practices are no longer active (Inglehart and Baker, 2000).====Making use of the first three waves of the World Values Survey, Guiso et al. (2003) find higher pro-market attitudes among Protestants than among Catholics, while Islam appears to be the most ==== religion. Hayward and Kemmelmeier (2011) extend this analysis to the societal level and find that historically Protestant societies have higher pro-market attitudes too. They attribute the existence of a Protestant ethic to the prevalence of a Protestant culture rather than to personal adherence to Protestant beliefs. Van Hoorn and Maseland (2013) find that unemployment hurts Protestants and historically Protestant societies more, which they interpret as evidence that work has a higher value in the Protestant world. Meanwhile, Schaltegger and Torgler (2010) find that religious behavior and education increase the commitment to hard work more strongly among Protestants than Catholics. By contrast, further evidence by Guiso et al. (2003) suggests that Protestants have no higher preference for thriftiness than Catholics. Shirokanova (2015) finds no significant difference between the Protestant and Muslim work ethic either. Indeed, Norris and Inglehart (2004) and Bozkurt and Yesilada (2017) find that Protestant societies today exhibit the weakest while Muslim societies the strongest work ethic. In line with Inglehart (1997), they associate this finding to the rise of post-materialist values and argue that the values encompassed in the Protestant ethic are today more common in developing countries with low existential security. In such countries, among which several countries with a Muslim tradition can be found, hard work still acts as a way to escape poverty and improve living conditions. Apart from that, Norris and Inglehart (2004) find that Protestant societies display higher ethical standards than Catholic societies (e.g., voluntary tax compliance). Related to this, Arruñada (2010) argues that the differences between Catholics and Protestants are not due to a different work ethic but due to a Protestant social ethic that encourages trust, cooperation and impersonal trade. Colvin and McCracken (2017) replicate Arruñada (2010) with more recent data and corroborate his argument. For their part, Alesina and Guiliano (2010) suggest that Protestants also have a weaker preference for both government intervention and redistribution, at least than Catholics. Guiso et al. (2003) also find evidence of higher interpersonal trust and legal commitment among Protestants than Catholics, whereas Muslims are less open to strangers and gender equality. This latter finding is consistent with Inglehart et al. (2002) and Inglehart and Norris (2003) who attribute the ==== between the Western and the Muslim world to lower gender equality rather than to lower support for democracy among Muslims. Rowley and Smith (2009) define this as the ====: Although Muslim-majority countries are less democratic and Muslims are less likely to take part in different forms of political participation (Omelicheva and Ahmed, 2018), they actually value democracy more than other people do.====The present paper revisits an old debate in the economics and sociology of religion and offers the following contribution to prior work. First, this paper extends the analysis of attitudinal differences in the economic sphere to the social and political field. Although there is research on the link between religion and the latter two fields, a comprehensive overview of the attitudinal differences across the economic, social and political sphere is missing. Partial exceptions to this are Arruñada (2010), Guiso et al. (2003) and Norris and Inglehart (2004). Yet, this research is based on somewhat outdated data and on a more limited battery of survey questions. Second, this paper incorporates Islam into the classic analysis of Catholicism and Protestantism and provides a deep theoretical and empirical understanding of the attitudinal differences that may persist among Catholics, Protestants and Muslims. A thorough comparison between the three religions is important for the following reasons: (1) it permits a deeper understanding of the challenges that the coexistence of the three religions may pose for social cohesion, for the effectiveness of economic integration, for the efficiency of both economic and social policy, or for the future of political integration. Awareness of these challenges may be especially important in Europe, where many Catholics, Protestants and Muslims cohabit (Arruñada and Krapf, 2019; Foret, 2009; Guiso et al., 2016a); (2) the possibility of a stronger work ethic in the Muslim world than in the Christian world today (Bozkurt and Yesilada, 2017) invites to extend this comparison to the social and political field; and (3) in his seminal work, Weber ([1920] 1988) not only compares Protestantism to Catholicism but also to Islam. However, this latter comparison has not received sufficient attention in the literature (Sukidi, 2006;  Shirokanova, 2015). Third, this paper includes data from the latest waves of the World Values Survey and the European Values Study and thus studies data not studied in earlier work. The latest survey waves include an increasing number of Muslim countries and novel questions on political preferences (e.g., military involvement in politics), which permits to meet the purpose of this paper in a more robust way. Fourth, and contrary to some previous research, this paper uses a broad battery of survey items over the largest possible number of survey waves for three reasons: (1) to acknowledge the multidimensional nature of theoretical constructs like the work ethic; (2) to increase robustness against the possibility that some findings may be due to the choice of a specific survey item and wave; (3) to increase robustness against the possibility that surveys may elicit circumstance-driven marginal preferences rather than culturally determined traits (Maseland and van Hoorn, 2009, 2011).====The present study puts forward three main hypotheses: (1) the ====, which refers to attitudes towards work and some fundamental characteristics of the market economy; (2) the ====, which concerns interpersonal trust, ethical standards and attitudes towards gender equality; (3) the ====, which covers attitudes towards democracy and political violence, institutional trust and preferences for government-organized redistribution. A focus on this set of attitudes and preferences is due to their proven impact on the following socioeconomic outcomes. First, the culture of work affects individual traits conducive to increasing productivity (e.g., discipline), whereas attitudes towards the market economy may explain regulatory policies or the weight of the state in the economy (Barro and McCleary, 2006; Guiso et al., 2003). Second, interpersonal trust reduces the problems of collective action and the transaction costs of impersonal trade, which is crucial to economic development (Algan and Cahuc, 2013; Knack and Keefer, 1997; Tabellini, 2010; Whiteley, 2000). Ethical standards affect the level of corruption and the quality of governance (Alesina and Angeletos, 2005; Kyriacou, 2016; Mauro, 1995), whereas attitudes towards gender equality are decisive for the labor endowment and political agenda (Guiso et al., 2003). Third, support for democracy and institutional trust generate political stability and social cohesion (Alesina et al., 1996; Algan et al., 2017), while preferences for redistribution affect economic outcomes like income inequality (Alesina and Guiliano, 2010; Alesina and Perotti, 1996). Finally, political violence poses a threat to contractual and property rights, with further implications for the efficient allocation of resources and the magnitude of investment (Knack and Keefer, 1995).====Although the results in this paper should be ultimately interpreted as partial correlations, the empirical analysis confirms some previous research and portrays the following broader picture. First, Protestants have no higher pro-work or pro-market attitudes than Catholics or Muslims. On the contrary, Muslims attach more importance to work than Protestants. Second, Protestants show higher interpersonal trust, ethical standards and support for democracy than Catholics. Protestants also state lower support for some non-democratic elements than Catholics and Muslims (e.g., strong leadership). Third, Muslims manifest lower acceptance of gender equality but greater support for theocratic ideas than Protestants and Catholics. Fourth, Muslims, and to a lesser degree Catholics, state a higher preference for government-organized redistribution than Protestants. A complementary analysis of regions with a historically strong influence of Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam provides additional support to this general picture. Historically Protestant societies show higher interpersonal trust but lower support for non-democratic elements than historically Catholic and Muslim societies. Protestant societies also state higher institutional trust than Catholic ones. Muslim societies, for their part, express lower acceptance of gender equality but higher pro-work attitudes and a higher preference for government-organized redistribution than both Christian societies. Compared to Catholic societies, Muslim societies also state higher ethical standards and institutional trust.====The aforementioned findings highlight two key points. First, the current attitudinal differences between Catholics, Protestants and Muslims lie more in the social and political sphere than in the economic sphere. Thus, consistent with the Weberian idea that a work ethic rooted in religion may have ceased to be palpable after a particular stage of history and development, market forces and the rise of post-materialist values may have played a part in the dissolution of the original role of this type of work ethic (Inglehart, 1997; Weber, [1920] 1988). This holds especially true for the Catholic and Protestant world. Conversely, the socio-political ethic associated with Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam continues to show itself in attitudinal differences concerning interpersonal trust, ethical standards and gender equality, and in political preferences. Second, the size of the ==== at the societal/cultural level suggests that the current attitudinal differences between the Catholic, Protestant and Muslim world are more related to their cultural and historical legacy than to current personal commitment to their specific doctrines.====The structure of this paper reads as follows. Section 2 develops the ==== and ==== on the basis of historical factors and religious precepts that may explain the persistence of attitudinal differences between Catholics, Protestants and Muslims. Section 3 describes the data and methodology to approach these hypotheses. Section 4 presents the results of the empirical analysis, whereas Section 5 discusses the limitations of the empirical approach. Section 6 concludes.","Catholics, Protestants and Muslims: Similar work ethics, different social and political ethics",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596723000185,Available online 22 May 2023,2023,Research Article,5.0

Besides, minimum education qualifications are increasingly being used as requirements for contesting elections, making it critical to understand the role of politicians’ education in their performance. This study investigates the impact of electing an educated politician on economic development in the politician’s constituency in India. The analysis uses constituency-level panel data on the intensity of night-time lights to measure economic activity. The identification strategy is based on a regression discontinuity design that exploits quasi-random outcomes of close elections between educated and less-educated politicians. The results show that narrowly electing a graduate leader, as compared to a non-graduate leader, in the state assembly constituency increases the growth rate of night-time lights by about 3 percentage points in the constituency. As pathways, graduate leaders are found to improve the provision of roads, electricity, and power; however, they do not significantly impact the overall provision of public goods. In comparison with findings from other studies in the literature, these results suggest that the impact of formal education of the leader is weaker than the leader’s other characteristics, such as gender or criminality.","In recent literature, education has been considered a marker of leader’s quality, assuming that formal education equips leaders with the necessary skill and competence to execute complex functions associated with holding a political office. While much of empirical research has used leader’s formal education level as a proxy for leadership quality, the evidence supporting this claim is ambiguous. Some studies claim a direct link (Besley and Reynal-Querol, 2011, Peveri, 2021, Yu and Jong-A-Pin, 2020) while others suggest that it is tenuous (Bastos and Sánchez, 2021, Carnes and Lupu, 2016, Curto-Grau and Gallego, 2019). The issue of the impact of educated leaders becomes far more relevant in a setting like India where minimum education requirements are increasingly being mandated for contesting elections. These mandates have been justified by courts and legislatures on the basis of assumed higher efficiency of educated political leaders, without much supporting evidence.====The existing literature has highlighted several reasons why educated leaders, compared to less educated leaders, may have an ambiguous effect on economic development. Educated legislators may promote growth if education influences their policy preferences, technical skills or dedication to serving public interest (Besley and Reynal-Querol, 2011, Congleton and Zhang, 2013, Dreher et al., 2009). They may drive more investment from businesses leading to higher growth (Francois et al., 2020) or improve chances of reforms as educated leaders understand them better (Dreher et al., 2009). On the other hand, education may impart human capital but that may not transfer into political ability to carry out policy tasks efficiently (Carnes and Lupu, 2016, Lahoti and Sahoo, 2020) or there may be a mismatch between preferences of educated leaders and their constituents (Curto-Grau and Gallego, 2019).====In this paper, we investigate whether politicians with higher levels of formal education lend to better economic development outcomes in areas under their jurisdiction. To explore the different pathways, we also analyze if educated leaders who have spent time in office, create developmental infrastructure or reduce crime that ultimately affects the level of economic activity in a constituency.====To shed light on this issue, we use data on elections of leaders to state legislatures in India. We assemble a data set on the educational qualifications of candidates contesting elections along with the election results. For the main outcome variable, we use intensity of night-time lights captured in satellite imagery. In absence of reliable data that can measure economic development at the assembly constituency level, this measure serves as a proxy variable. Previous studies have established the use of nigh-time lights as a proxy for measuring sub-national GDP (Chen and Nordhaus, 2011, Doll et al., 2006, Donaldson and Storeygard, 2016, Henderson et al., 2012). Night-time lights data are available annually at a spatially granular level and can be aggregated to provide estimates at the constituency level. Combining data on leader’s education and night-time lights outcome, we construct a comprehensive panel data at the constituency level for the period 2009–2013.====A challenge in estimating the causal effect of legislator’s education is that election of educated leaders to state legislature might be non-random and driven by unobserved voter preferences and other constituency level characteristics, thus making it an endogenous process. To overcome this challenge and estimate the casual effect of educated leaders, we use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on close elections between educated and less-educated candidates. The identification strategy relies on the quasi-random outcomes of close elections; this set-up has been widely used in the related literature (Lee, 2008, Eggers et al., 2015). Comparing constituencies where an educated leader wins by a narrow margin with constituencies where a less-educated leader wins by a narrow margin, we can isolate the casual effect of educated legislator.====Using the RDD we find that, on average, election of a graduate leader results in approximately 3 percentage points higher growth rate of annual average intensity of night-time lights in the constituency. The point estimates are stable and robust across alternate bandwidths and to the inclusion of fixed effects that control for unobserved heterogeneity at the regional level. Our results are also robust to alternate specifications and exclusion of extreme values of the outcome variable. Using existing estimates from the literature on the elasticity of GDP growth to night-time lights growth (Baskaran et al., 2021, Bickenbach et al., 2016), we find that election of an educated leader results in roughly 0.3 to 0.45 percentage points higher GDP growth rate per year in the constituency. Additionally, we find that the impact of educated leaders is driven by leaders who have a college-graduate degree and not by those who have only completed schooling. Among politicians with a graduate degree, only those with a degree in law seem to have a significant positive effect. Graduates with a degree in arts, commerce, or science do not have any significant effect. The estimate also varies by the initial level of development in the states, with the effect being larger in the least developed states. We also explore further heterogeneity in the effect of graduate leaders based on their gender, age, criminality, and affiliation with the state ruling party.====We examine the internal validity of our empirical strategy by performing a range of checks on the RD design. We show that constituency level pre-determined characteristics are balanced around the threshold of discontinuity. Besides, we find no evidence to suggest that educated leaders are more likely to win or lose in close elections, implying that the outcome of close elections are not manipulated. We also conduct balance check of candidate characteristics to isolate the effect of education from any other characteristics that may be correlated. In addition, we conduct various placebo tests and find that the placebo estimates are insignificant and smaller than the true estimate. These analyses help us establish that the outcome of close elections are indeed quasi-random and our estimates reflect the causal effect of leader’s education. Further, we inspect the external validity and broader applicability of our results beyond close elections. We compare a range of candidate and constituency level characteristics across close and non-close elections and mixed and non-mixed elections, finding no substantive differences in them.====We also explore the mechanisms through which educated leaders may impact economic growth. We postulate that the theoretical channels through which an educated leader impacts economic growth are higher competency and skills, and better beliefs and values. Education improves leaders’ skills, making them more competent. Through knowledge and exposure, their beliefs and values are also impacted. Given the nature of the data we cannot test these channels directly. We provide some indirect evidence supporting these hypotheses, although the relationships we test are essentially reduced-form in nature and we are unable to identify precise mechanisms for our main results.====We examine the impact of educated leader on provision of infrastructure facilities, crimes, and corruption. We find that election of graduate legislators result in around 0.3 standard deviation increase in access to both roads and power supply. Similarly, the percentage of households that have access to electricity as the main source of lighting is 5.3 percentage points higher if a graduate candidate is elected. With regard to crime outcome, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in the proportion of graduate legislators in a district on average causes a 1.2 to 1.9 percent decline in the reported crime in the constituency. This result indicates that an educated legislator may lead to better environment for economic activity and growth. We do not find any statistically significant difference between graduate and non-graduate legislators’ growth in private assets which we use as a proxy for corruption following Fisman et al. (2014).====Comparing our results to the existing literature on leader’s identity in the Indian context, we find that the effect of leader’s education on economic growth is relatively smaller. Prakash et al. (2019) show that electing a criminally accused politician lowers the growth rate in night-time lights by about 24 percentage points and Baskaran et al. (2021) estimate that electing a woman legislator increases growth in night-time lights by about 15 percentage points. As compared to these studies that follow a similar identification strategy and outcome variable, we find a relatively small impact of only 3 percentage point increase in night-time lights of electing an educated legislator.====Our paper contributes to various strands of literature. First and most directly, our paper contributes to the literature exploring whether education is an important marker in determining the skill and competence of leaders holding public office. Specifically, our findings contribute to whether educated leaders enhance economic development in their jurisdiction by facilitating provision of public infrastructure (Mitra, 2020, Bastos and Sánchez, 2021, Besley and Reynal-Querol, 2011, Carnes and Lupu, 2016, Curto-Grau and Gallego, 2019, Lahoti and Sahoo, 2020). Our estimates based on RD specification and data from a developing country add to the existing body of evidence. To the best of our knowledge, Lahoti and Sahoo (2020) is the only other paper that analyzes the effect of educated leaders in the Indian context. They investigate the impact of graduate legislators on quality of education in schools in the legislators’ constituencies. In contrast, we analyze the impact on economic growth and its channels. Moreover, our study suggests that with regard to the level of formal education of the leader, attainment of a college-graduate degree is the main differentiating factor. We also go further than the literature by investigating the type of degree that matters. We show that the impact of graduate leaders is driven by those with a law degree.====Secondly, our findings add to the literature on the role of identity and characteristics of leaders in development and policy outcomes. We find evidence in support of citizen candidate models put forth in Besley and Coate (1997) and Osborne and Slivinski (1996). These models suggest that demographic characteristics contribute to the identity of a leader and they have the potential to significantly impact policy outcomes (Besley, 2005). Candidate characteristics that have been found to matter include gender (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004, Bhalotra and Clots-Figueras, 2014, Bhalotra et al., 2014, Bhalotra et al., 2018), caste (Pande, 2003), criminality (Prakash et al., 2019), political affiliation (Hill and Jones, 2017, Gulzar and Pasquale, 2017), and political alignment (Asher and Novosad, 2017). We add to this strand by considering education to be an important dimension of a leader’s identity and add evidence to the related literature (Besley and Reynal-Querol, 2011, Carnes and Lupu, 2016, Lahoti and Sahoo, 2020).====Our analysis is motivated by policy measures being considered across Indian states to institute a mandate for minimum educational qualifications for candidates contesting elections. Haryana==== and Rajasthan==== put in place policies mandating minimum educational requirements for candidates contesting local body elections, and Assam and Maharashtra have considered incorporating a similar policy.==== Policy mandates for minimum education are crucial as they have implications for equality and representation, especially for marginalized sections of the society.==== Any restriction placed on limiting the ability of individuals to contest has been considered undemocratic, elitist and discriminatory.==== It also affects political selection by changing the pool and subsequent selection of candidates contesting elections. Afzal (2014) and Curto-Grau and Gallego (2019) find that educational elitism has consequences for representation. Altering the identity of candidates who will hold office may change the nature of policies and the credibility with which policies are implemented (Arora, 2022, Besley, 2005). In this regard, although our paper bypasses the aspect of political selection by exploiting quasi-random variations emanating from close elections, we show that education level of leaders may have a limited impact compared to other characteristics of leaders. Thus, ballot access restriction by educational mandates may not have the intended consequence of vastly improving efficiency of the elected legislators.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We document that individuals who experienced a macroeconomic shock during their impressionable years (between 18 and 25 years of age), are currently more prone to voting for populist parties, and manifest lower trust both in national and European institutions. We use data for EU countries from the European Social Survey (ESS) to construct the differential individual exposure to macroeconomic shocks during impressionable years. Our findings suggest that it is not only current exposure to shocks that matters (see e.g., Guiso et al., 2020) but also past exposure to economic recessions, which has a persistent positive effect on the rise of populism. Interestingly, the interplay between the two, i.e., past and current exposure to economic shocks, has a mitigating effect on the rise of populism. Individuals who were exposed to economic shocks in the past are less likely to manifest populist attitudes when faced with a current crisis, as suggested by the experience-based learning literature.","In recent years, European countries have seen an unprecedented demand for populism as a result of the economic crisis that hit Europe and the world. The aftermath of the crisis found Europe with a number of new and existing populist parties succeeding to enter national parliaments.====A vast literature, initially from the domains of political science and sociology attempted to explain the origins of populism.==== Recently an emerging strand of the literature in economics has theoretically discussed and empirically established the economic drivers of populism. Our paper contributes to this literature by arguing that it is not only current socioeconomic conditions and recent shocks that drive populist attitudes, but also past experiences.====We use as a starting point the analysis in Guiso et al. (2020) to shed light to an additional dimension of the implications of economic shocks on populist attitudes, i.e., the impact of the impressionable exposure to economic shocks (Giuliano and Spilimbergo, 2023). In our analysis, on top of accounting for current exposure to economic shocks, we explore the effect of macroeconomic shocks during the critical years of early adulthood (the so-called impressionable years) on voting for populist parties, low participation in national elections, mistrust in political institutions and negative attitudes towards immigrants. As a macroeconomic shock we define the GDP per capita growth rate equal or lower than −3.4%.==== This threshold represents the lowest 10th percentile of the GDP per capita growth distribution for all countries from 1960 to 2020.====Analytically, we use data from the eight waves (2002–2017) of the European Social Survey (ESS) and we associate each individual to his/her past exposure to economic shocks during their impressionable years. The impressionable years hypothesis supports that core attitudes, beliefs, and values are crystallized during a period of great mental plasticity in early adulthood (between 18 and 25 years of age) and remain largely unchanged thereafter (Krosnick and Alwin, 1989). As additional controls we include the individual current shocks as in Guiso et al. (2020), a set of individual controls, and a wide set of fixed effects such as wave, country, age and cohort fixed effects and in a more demanding specification we use as well country ==== age fixed effects, thereby capturing a wide set of unobservables and comparing same age individuals across different countries.====Our findings suggest that both current and impressionable exposure to shocks matters for the formation of populist attitudes. A 1 standard deviation increase in exposure to economic shocks between the age range 18 and 25 (impressionable years) is associated with a 0.014 standard deviations increase in voting in last elections, a 0.011 standard deviations rise in voting for populist parties and roughly a 0.02 decrease in trust in political parties, national parliament, EU, politicians and satisfaction with government. Additionally, impressionable exposure to macroeconomic shocks gives rise to negative attitudes towards immigrants coming from countries outside the EU, having different ethnicity and the beliefs that immigrants worsen the host countries.====Our findings remain significant and robust to various specifications. First, we eliminate from our analysis both the first and the second generation immigrants to make sure that inertia in cultural attitudes does not affect our analysis. Then, we use an alternative measure of macroeconomic shock exposure during the impressionable years. Analytically, we define the GDP per capita growth rate to be equal or lower than −6.3%, representing the 5th percentile of the GDP per capita growth rate. Third, we shift our analysis to other age ranges between 18 and 33 years combining the impressionable years hypothesis with the increasing persistence hypothesis (Sears, 1983). Fourth, we replicate the benchmark analysis, restricting the sample to countries with at least one populist party. Last, following Aassve et al. (2018), we replicate our benchmark analysis controlling for past exposure to political corruption. As established in Aassve et al. (2018) such a shock experienced during the individuals’ impressionable years confers significant effects on trust.====Having tested the sensitivity of our results to a series of robustness checks we proceed to introducing a section where we explore several sources of heterogeneity. Analytically, we explore the differential exposure to media and differential interaction with family and friends, as both can be a critical determinant of attitudes and voting decisions for people. Our findings suggest that media systematically shape voting, trust and immigration-related attitudes, and so does the interaction with friends/family (it should be noted though that the effect of media is stronger). In both cases however, the interaction between media, friends/family and the shock is not systematically significant, thus suggesting that the one does not reinforce/mitigate the other.====Last, we explore the interplay between current shocks and past exposure. Interestingly, we find also that when we interact both past and current exposure to economic shocks, the two experiences mitigate each other’s effect. Meaning that an individual who is currently exposed to an economic shock, is less likely to manifest populist attitudes if he/she was exposed to economic shocks in the past.====What can explain this intriguing finding concerning the interplay between current and past exposure? Our findings can be motivated based upon the experience-based learning process (Malmendier and Nagel, 2011, Malmendier, 2021). More broadly Malmendier (2021) argues that past experiences alter us and shape our future reactions. As the author mentions ==== Interestingly, Malmendier and Nagel (2016) illustrate that in the context of past and current exposure to inflation and its implications on the weight that young and older individuals place on new information, young individuals react more strongly to an inflation surprise than older individuals who have past inflation-related experiences.====In a similar rationale, individuals in our sample can react in the same way in terms of populism when exposed to a shock. However, individuals who have experienced higher exposure to past shocks, react more moderately compared to individuals who have not had much exposure to past shocks.====Uncovering the importance of the past experiences and the interplay between present and the past economic experiences is particularly important. It provides an explanation as to why people from different countries, with similar otherwise economic profiles, respond differently to modern-day economic challenges. Moreover, it is a factor to consider when shaping policies that affect the economic life of individuals and through it their political attitudes, suggesting that history plays a crucial role and should be factored in any political decision.====The structure of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing literature and Section 3 introduces the data and the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the benchmark results. Section 5 conducts robustness exercises.

To do this, our econometric analysis is based on an original approach combining microeconomic level data on firms’ access to finance and macroeconomic level data on countries’ level of natural resource rents, with a focus on energy rents (oil, gas and coal). By doing so, we are able to investigate in a more precise and disaggregated way the mechanisms explaining why resource-based countries are associated with less developed financial systems. Using panel regressions, we find significant and robust evidence that firms operating in countries characterized by a high level of natural resource rents suffer from less access to external financing. Moreover, depending on two important transmission channels, namely, the quality of institutions and the extent of supply constraints, we find heterogeneities in the relationship between firms’ access to finance and countries’ level of natural resource rents. In addition, we show that the countries’ level of natural resource rents has a significant and negative correlation with firms’ access to finance only for firms that do not operate in the natural resource sector. This provides new evidence of the Dutch disease phenomenon, since the lack of firms’ financing can also be an explanation for the atrophy of sectors unrelated to the natural resource sector.","A vast body of literature has tried to answer whether natural resources are a “curse” or a “blessing” (van der Ploeg, 2011; Frankel, 2012). This question is even more important and topical in the current period regarding the recent surge in commodity prices – especially oil and gas ones – due to the Covid-19 crisis, the Ukraine-Russian war and the ongoing energy and ecological transition process engaged by most of the countries in the world. If the negative consequences of surging commodity prices for resources and energy importers are well debated, it is less the case for exporters. However, the question about the impact of such changes in the so-called resource-based countries is also crucial. Indeed, energy and oil exports are expected to strongly decrease in a near future, leading to less windfalls but increasing volatility for resource-based countries. Less windfalls might relax the overweight of the natural resource sector, but at the same time, less revenues imply a deep structural change for resource-based economies and can hamper financing access for firms. More uncertainty and volatility might also occur and reinforce constraints on firm's access to finance if the resource revenues continue to be allocated in an inefficient manner. It is difficult to forecast what the net effects of the energy transition will be from a resource curse perspective, but we can expect that they will be conditional on the nature of the resources – energy or minerals? – and to the attitude of countries facing the energy transition. As a result, the question about the relationship between natural resources and economic development is still active and the role of the financial sector is a crucial channel. Financial instability, limited credit supply and/or presence of constraints in the firm's access to finance could hamper the development of resource-based countries.====Over the past decade, there has been a renewal in the resource curse literature (Badeeb et al., 2017), with an emphasis on the role played by the financial sector, leading to the so-called “financial resource curse”. According to the seminal work of Beck (2011), the financial resource curse can be viewed as a financial intermediation problem. Beck (2011) explains that banks in resource-based countries are better capitalized and more profitable but distribute fewer loans to firms. This results in a less developed financial system in resource-based countries, which could be an explanation to the resource curse itself. In other words, countries with less developed financial system are associated to lower economic growth rates ceteris paribus.",Firms’ access to finance in resource-based countries and the financial resource curse,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596723000331,Available online 13 May 2023,2023,Research Article,8.0

The results show that wage inequality in the public sector is an important determinant of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. Increasing the wages of public officials could help reduce corruption in countries with low public sector wage inequality. In countries where public sector wages are highly unequal, however, raising the wages of government employees could increase corruption. These results are robust to a wide range of empirical model specifications, estimation methods, and distributional assumptions. Combining increases in public sector wages with policies affecting wage distribution could help policy makers design cost-effective programs to reduce corruption in their countries.","Anti-corruption policies in many countries rely on the notion that corruption is caused by low wages in the public sector. In attempts to curtail corruption, Argentina, Georgia, Ghana, Peru, Singapore, and other countries have implemented public sector reforms to increase the wages of government officials.====The evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions is mixed. Some studies find that higher wages in the public sector were associated with lower corruption (Klitgaad 1997; Van Rijckeghem and Weder 2001; An and Kweon 2017). Others find no significant effect (Panizza 2001; Ades and DiTella 1997, and Treisman 2000 2007) or reverse effect, with high levels of corruption leading to low wages in the public sector (Rose-Ackerman and Søreide, 2012).====Differences in the availability, quality, and comparability of data, as well as methodological issues related to the potential effects of unobservable factors, account for the mixed results (Treisman 2007). Newly available cross-country data from the Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators database allow us to address many of these problems and present new evidence on the effectiveness of increasing wages as an anti-corruption measure.====Our findings suggest that the distribution of wages in the public sector (measured as a ratio of the 90th to the 10th wage percentiles) could be an important determinant of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies.==== The heterogeneity in the impact of higher wages on corruption with respect to wage inequality in the public sector may partly explain why some of the previous studies have found no significant effects of wages on corruption. We find that higher wages may reduce corruption in countries with relatively compressed wages in the public sector. In contrast, increases in the wages of public servants can encourage corruption if public sector wages are highly unequal. Combining the increases in public sector wages with policies aimed at reducing public sector wage inequality might allow policy makers to design cost-effective programs to lower corruption in their countries.====The longitudinal structure of our data allows us to tackle a range of econometric issues that previous studies could not address. We also use indicators obtained from micro-level surveys. Most cross-country studies of corruption and wages rely on macro-level data to derive the public-private wage premium (e.g., Van Rijckeghem and Weder 2001, An and Kweon 2017, Treisman 2000). Such an approach is associated with persistent measurement errors and fails to control for age, gender, education, location, and other individual characteristics in deriving the public wage premium (Schiavo-Campo et al., 1997; Le et al., 2018). This “unadjusted” wage differential captures the differences between the characteristics of workers between the public and private sectors and not the differences in returns to these characteristics. Our analysis relies on an “adjusted pay premium” that reflects the wage differences between comparable workers employed in the two sectors (Borjas 2012). Our results are robust to a wide range of empirical model specifications, estimation methods, and distributional assumptions.====The following section reviews the literature on the effect of public sector wages on corruption.

We hypothesize that political influence on lending behavior in electoral autocracies extends to all banks, irrespective of ownership or political connections. Employing monthly data on individual banks, we consider the lending behavior of Russian banks in the four presidential elections held between 2004 and 2019. We find that both state-owned and private banks increased their lending before these presidential elections. Controlling for economic fluctuations, the pre-election lending surge is followed by a deterioration of loan quality the following year. We show that private banks are rewarded for boosting their lending before an election with government deposits after the election. Our findings support the view that the authorities in electoral autocracies such as Russia have the capacity and means to influence lending of private and state-owned banks in pursuit of favorable election outcomes.","Electoral autocracies have received increased media coverage with the political evolutions of Russia, Turkey, Venezuela and other strongman states. As defined by the V-Dem Institute====, these regimes marry democratic institutions, particularly regularly scheduled elections (their main mechanism for acquiring power), with vigorous wielding of ruling-party administrative advantages (especially instrumentalities associated with political authority, control and intimidation). These 21st century electoral autocracies are often described as personalist autocracies, where the legitimacy of the ruling party rests on the popularity of the incumbent strongman. Using the levers of power to shape election outcomes is the name of the game in such states.====In addition to the familiar channels available for achieving desired political outcomes in electoral autocracies such as media control (Stier, 2015) and electoral fraud (Moser and White, 2017), banks may also help incumbents influence election outcomes. Recent literature on the experiences of countries with election-related bank lending suggests that state-owned banks provide the instrumentality for influencing electoral outcomes (Dinc, 2005; Carvalho, 2014; Englmaier and Stowasser, 2017; Schoors and Weill, 2020; Bircan and Saka, 2021). This literature supports the view that political interference in the lending of state-owned banks tends to manifest around election time in all regimes that hold elections, regardless of whether they are democracies or electoral autocracies. This finding accords with the view that incumbents generally have an incentive to use all available resources to increase their chances of re-election (Gandhi and Lust-Okar, 2009).====Our narrower question here is whether such political interference during election cycles extends to private banks in electoral autocracies. Does the pursuit of political goals lead to interference in private bank lending behavior? In his seminal paper on state-owned bank lending, Dinc (2005) describes a motivation for this behavior, noting specifically that politicians might go so far as to use their power to influence private bank lending.====Electoral autocracies differ from democracies and traditional autocracies in their incentives and possibilities to influence state-owned and private banks. As their constitutions provide checks and balances, democracies offer few opportunities for influencing elections through private banks. Moreover, the free press can give politicians a hard time if they put too much pressure on private banks. By the same token, traditional autocracies have little motivation to pressure banks about elections. Voting in such regimes largely serves to provide window-dressing for autocrat legitimacy.====We hypothesize that the authorities in electoral autocracies are able to stimulate lending from both state-owned and private banks during the run-up to a major national election. We do not necessarily expect, however, the political influence is the same for state-owned and private of banks. While manipulation of state-owned banks is straightforward and apparent, political influence over private banks depends on their perceived susceptibility and the ability of politicians to provide appropriate carrots and sticks to achieve their desired outcomes. In a stable electoral autocracy, all agents – including private banks – have learned to behave in the manner desired by the authorities, even if no explicit incentives are applied.====To test our main hypothesis, we analyze the existence of electoral lending cycles in Russia. We examine whether Russian banks, both state-owned and private, increase their lending ahead of elections, and whether this behavior entails an economic cost. Russia provides an ideal setting for investigation of our research question. It is a good example of an electoral autocracy combining the organization of regular presidential elections with the privileged position of the incumbent leader.====While Russia also regularly holds parliamentary elections, we focus on presidential elections as they matter most to the electoral autocrat. As observed by Frye (2021), regular presidential elections demonstrate effort on the part of the leader to bolster legitimacy through the vote, e.g. Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, and Hungary. These personalist electoral autocracies are characterized by their leaders striving to build an aura of legitimacy with the population at large. Guriev and Treisman (2022) argue that over the past 30 years an increasing share of autocratic leaders globally have become spin dictators. As opposed to fear dictators, the spin dictators hold elections, allow some degree of opposition and avoid overt violence. For a spin dictator, elections and autocrat popularity are hugely important tools to manipulate information and remain in power. Following this definition, the authors classify Russian president Vladimir Putin as a prime example of spin dictator.====Frye (2021) further explains that Russia is a classic personalist autocracy in the sense that a single individual dominates policy and personnel decisions. Russia has been a personalist political regime during the Putin era (Geddes et al., 2014 and Baturo and Elkink, 2021). It has however become more personalist over the years (Baturo and Elkink, 2016). As summarized by Kendall-Taylor et al. (2017), the regime has become gradually more personalized from the neutralization of influential oligarchs during the first term 2000–2004 to the accumulation of power since 2012.====As Zavadskaya (2018) notes, presidential elections in electoral autocracies such as Russia are intertwined with personal power – a major difference from parliamentary elections in democracies. Corroborating the view that parliamentary elections matter less in a leader-driven political context, Lankina and Tertytchnaya (2019) note that Russian parliamentary elections have lower voter turnout and a lower probability of post-election protests than presidential elections.====Another salient feature of presidential elections in electoral autocracies is that they are essential to regime change. Indeed, Russia's regime is much more focused on the presidential election outcome than Duma elections. Parliamentary elections hold less importance in an electoral autocracy since the outcome does not provide a clear measure of the leader's political strength. Russia's Duma, for example, comprises a range of parties. The party of the president==== (United Russia or Unity) explicitly supports the regime. Others, such as the Liberal Democrats, implicitly back the regime through their votes. Consequently, the outcome of the elections does little to bolster regime legitimacy.====For all of the above reasons, interference in bank lending before presidential elections holds much greater importance than before parliamentary elections. In three out of four elections in our observation period (2004, 2008, 2012), however, the Russian presidential elections were held about three months after the parliamentary elections. Thus, we also face a practical problem stemming from the fact that the pre-parliamentary election period partially overlaps with the pre-presidential election period, making it impossible to properly identify separate effects of parliamentary elections in such presidential election super-cycles.====To investigate whether banks increase their lending before Russian presidential elections, we utilize detailed monthly data on individual banks from the Central Bank of Russia to identify with high precision any changes in bank lending before elections. Our observation period runs from 2004 to 2019, a period that includes four presidential elections (2004, 2008, 2012 and 2018). As evidence of heightened lending prior to elections could result from a higher demand for loans rather than a supply-related factor like political pressure, we reduce the possibility that our results are driven by demand-related considerations such as a pre-election economic expansion by controlling for macroeconomic fluctuations in our estimations. In an attempt to understand the underlying mechanisms, we investigate the potential influence of political connections on private bank lending behavior during election times by analyzing the behavior of spetsbanks. These are privately held banks for the most part and considered to be politically connected (Berkowitz et al., 2014). We find evidence that all banks boosted their lending in the run-up to a presidential election, irrespective of ownership, or political connections. These results reject the political connections channel, lending support to our hypothesis that all banks are subject to political influence in Russia's electoral autocracy.====In support of a political lending cycle, our results further reveal that loan quality deteriorates in the year after the election relative to years more remote from the presidential election cycle. Were pre-election lending solely driven by economic factors, we would not expect a significant post-election rise in bad loans. The deterioration of loan quality after Russian presidential elections, however, accords with the view that the pre-election lending surge is predominantly unrelated to economic factors. This finding bolsters our interpretation of politically motivated bank lending behavior.====Banks may also have their own self-interest in mind when boosting their lending before an election. We thus test to see whether private banks encouraged to increase lending before an election are rewarded with an increase in government deposits after the election. Indeed, we find evidence of a tit-for-tat reward mechanism that produces increased government deposits. Alternatively, we check to see whether banks with weak fundamentals voluntarily decide to increase their supply of loans to buy implicit protection (or even regulatory forbearance) when they risk imminent license withdrawal. We find no evidence that banks with weak fundamentals are likely to be more generous in their lending than other banks in the run-up to an election.====Our analysis contributes to the literature on the interplay between politics and banking in electoral autocracies. Earlier papers have usually considered democracies (for Brazil: Carvalho, 2014; for Germany: Englmaier and Stowasser, 2017) or cross-country samples (Dinc, 2005). We extend the literature by considering how bank lending can be used to affect election outcomes in an electoral autocracy. Furthermore, we investigate the channel of lending through private banks rather than restricting the analysis to state-owned banks. Both these contributions distinguish our analysis from Schoors and Weill (2020), who investigate the lending behavior of Sberbank, Russia's giant state-owned bank, during the 2000 presidential election cycle, i.e. at a time when Russia could still be considered a democracy.==== Here, we consider the lending behavior of all banks, both state-owned and private in a firmly established electoral autocracy.====The rest of the article is structured as follows.

This approach addresses selection bias and endogeneity generally better than extant studies. Meaningful increases in the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) index are related to changes in (i) decile income shares, (ii) decile income levels, and (iii) Gini coefficients. Increased economic freedom is associated with significant gains across the income distribution. It is also associated with modest increases in inequality – associated particularly with gains in the top income decile.","There is now little doubt that economic freedom – at least as measured by the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) index – is positively correlated with growth in per capita incomes, across both countries and time.==== However, whether the returns to greater economic freedom are shared broadly ==== is debatable (Bennett and Nikolaev, 2017). Extant studies employ various econometric approaches and consider different measures of income inequality, country samples, and time periods. Their results have been mixed.====Most of those studies focus on some form of Gini coefficient (for either income or consumption) as the dependent (or outcome) variable. (Recent examples include Graafland (2018), Apergis and Cooray (2017), Krieger and Meierrieks (2016), Bennett and Cebula (2015), Sturm and De Haan (2015), and Bergh and Nilsson (2010); see Bennett and Nikolaev (2017) for a survey.) Alternatively, Saccone (2021) and Dean and Lawson (2021) focus on income deciles, their population shares and average income levels respectively. Similar to the Gini coefficient studies, their results are mixed: economic freedom, on the one hand, is negatively related to all but the highest two decile shares; but it is positively related to all decile levels. Also, Bergh and Bjørnskov (2021) examine the role of economic freedom on income growth at different quintiles.==== They report positive effects of economic freedom for all parts of the income distribution.====Does a rising tide of economic freedom lift the boats of a country's poor, middle class, and wealthy? Or – as most commonly is alternatively hypothesized – does greater economic freedom favor the wealthy at the expense of the rest?====Reconciling the often-contradictory results of this fairly large applied literature is a challenge to researchers. Bennett and Nikolaev (2017) replicate Bergh and Nilsson's (2010) study; also an older study by Carter (2006). Based on these replications, they then explore the sensitivity of results (each and comparatively) to variation in the econometric model, the sample, and the inequality measure employed. They find that all three factors may indeed matter. But there are plausible reasons to think that the choice of econometric model is of first-order importance.====There are overarching concerns of endogeneity and nonlinearity that the literature has not satisfactorily addressed. For example, a number of authors have pointed out that inequality can cause economic freedom (rather than – or in addition to – the other way around) (e.g. Apergis et al. 2014; Murphy, 2015; Krieger and Meierrieks, 2016).==== There are also likely to be unobserved factors that determine both changes in economic freedom and inequality, leading to selection bias. Furthermore, regression models (which of one form or another are used in all the extant studies) assume that the marginal effect of economic freedom is constant; but changes in economic freedom may need to be “large enough” to trigger meaningful changes in the income distribution. Those “large enough” cases (in our analysis, the ====) are bound to be small relative to the overall sample of observations. However, matching methods allow us to leverage the information from that larger overall sample: counterfactuals can be constructed based on the experiences of other countries that closely resemble the treated countries (save for the fact, of course, that they did not receive the treatment).====Only a handful of the extant studies attempt to address these concerns. Regarding endogeneity, Bennett and Nikolaev (2017) employ a dynamic system GMM approach (Arellano and Bond, 1991, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998). This approach has been understandably appealing given the difficulty of finding strong and plausibly valid instruments when dealing with cross-country data. However, identification is ultimately based on using lagged levels and differences of endogenous regressors as instruments.==== Institutions and other substantive policies determine the extent of economic freedom; they are persistent and so is the extent of income inequality. The ==== assumption is not particularly plausible (and, of course, not testable).==== Regarding nonlinearity, Apergis and Cooray (2017) include both a linear and squared term on economic freedom in their regressions, but this does not really address the “large enough” concern described above.====In this paper we employ matching methods to address the above-mentioned concerns. Matching methods have been increasingly employed with country-level panel data.==== The approach is non-parametric, so we are able to (i) ====, (ii) ====.==== As such, we may choose to only look at score changes of a certain magnitude; and/or we may insist that the change is sustained for a certain number of years.

By employing matching methods, we work to mitigate endogeneity and nonlinearity concerns. Furthermore, we examine whether varying the sample based on development level or threshold of increase in economic freedom makes a difference.====We proceed as follows. In Section 2 we discuss channels through which increases in economic freedom may be expected to affect inequality. While the channels can be identified, the net effects of them are ambiguous. The question of the economic freedom-inequality relationship is, therefore, an empirical one. In Section 3 we discuss the matching methods that we employ in the empirical analysis of that relationship. With those methods, we employ country-level data, including measures of inequality and economic freedom, that are described in Section 4. Benchmark results of our analysis are reported in Section 5. Robustness checks are reported in Sections 6 and 7.

We estimate intent-to-treat effects of the program by exploiting a natural experiment arising from select geographical implementation and the eligibility of program benefits for first/second born children using the National Family Health Survey-4 data. We find an increase in birth weight, duration of breastfeeding and long term weight-forage, with a larger impact on male children. The effects are positive for height-for-age and negative for infant mortality, albeit insignificant, and significantly negative for neonatal mortality but only over a longer time period. These results are in contrast to the existing two studies in the nascent literature, which in the context of limited availability of healthcare services, find no effect of maternity support CCTs on child health outcomes. Thus, our findings show that institutional factors that ensure access to local health infrastructure for meeting the imposed conditionalities are important for the success of maternal CCT schemes.","Children in developing countries are plagued by low birth weight, stunting and wastage. In India, for instance, the recent National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) shows that 36% children under age five were underweight, 38% stunted and 21% wasted in 2015–16. Since fetal and early childhood health are vital determinants of adult health, cognitive ability and labor market outcomes (Almond et al., 2018, Almond and Currie, 2011, Bharadwaj et al., 2019, Case and Paxson, 2008), identifying levers that improve birth outcomes in developing countries are important.====These policies generally target the leading causes for poor birth outcomes in developing countries, which include mother’s low pre-pregnancy weight, poor nutrition intake, limited access to medical care during pregnancy, and in-utero exposure to harmful external factors like pollution, disease and violence (Ramakrishnan, 2004, Aizer and Currie, 2014, Aizer, 2011, Coffey and Hathi, 2016). Among these policies, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) are an important tool used across countries. The impacts of general CCTs on child health outcomes, however, remain mixed while that of maternal support CCT’s remains under explored. This paper evaluates a maternity support scheme called ====, launched in the state of Odisha, India in October 2011, which gave cash transfers to rural pregnant women conditional on certain requirements being fulfilled.====The aim of this scheme was to improve maternal and child health by promoting positive-health seeking practices in pregnant and lactating women. The conditions involved uptake of supplements, antenatal and postnatal counseling, full immunization of child up to 9 months and regular monitoring of the child’s weight from birth up to 9 months of age. To encourage the adoption of above practices, the program offered cash incentives to women. The incentives were offered during the pre-pregnancy period and up to the child attaining nine months of age to decrease the likelihood of the mother working immediately after delivery and thus, promoting breastfeeding. We examine the effects of the scheme on short-run child outcomes like birth weight (BW), infant mortality rate (IMR), neonatal mortality (NNM) and duration of breastfeeding, which were directly intended to be affected. In addition, we also evaluate its effects on long-run health outcomes (at approximately 3–4 years of age) like Weight-for-Age (WAZ) and Height-for-Age (HAZ) z-scores of children.====Using the NFHS-4 data collected in 2015–16 on children born in the last five years and a triple difference-in-differences strategy, we estimate the intent-to-treat impact of the program on the above outcomes. Births in 2011 fall in the pre-treatment period while births in 2012 are assigned to the post-treatment period. Further, we exploit the absence of such a program in the adjoining states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, which like Odisha have been recognized as low performing states on maternal health outcomes by the Government of India and combine it with the program’s eligibility criteria of the benefits for first and second-born children. Hence, our estimation strategy allows us to control for factors that are constant over time in a geographical region, differential trends in outcomes in treatment and control states and importantly, for factors that affect overall health outcomes over time in eligible and non-eligible children. We also show the robustness of our results by using data on district-level number of program beneficiaries and estimate the effect of treatment intensity on outcomes since the implementation quality differed across districts within Odisha.==== Additionally, we also show that the program increased full immunization rates. We also use the NFHS-3 and rule out any pre-trends in outcomes. These findings underscore our claim that the intent-to-treat effects of the program on health outcomes are driven by the program.====We find a positive effect of the program on birth weight (6%), duration of breastfeeding (5 months) and WAZ scores (0.14 standard deviation) but a positive and insignificant effect on HAZ scores (0.10 standard deviation) while there is no effect on infant and neonatal mortality among children exposed to the scheme in the first year of its implementation. Extending the analyses for births up to 2015, we also find a significantly negative effect on NNM. Overall, the program seems to have had a larger effect on short-run outcomes but the effects on long-run outcomes are small, even when significant. Even among the short term outcomes, consistently significant effects are observed for self-reported outcomes like birth weight and breastfeeding and not for mortality outcomes like IMR and NNM. Self-reported outcomes can suffer from measurement error due to recall or due to over-reporting by treated mothers. However, we also observe a positive effect on birth weight of children for whom this data is noted from a health card, where this is recorded by the Anganwadi Worker (AWW) at the time of birth.==== Thus, self-reporting cannot be the only factor driving the improvement in birth weight.====The positive program effects are larger for boys than for girls.==== This is in line with the existing literature on prenatal discrimination against females in India (Bharadwaj and Lakdawala, 2013) as well as male fetuses being more susceptible to in-utero negative shocks (Kraemer, 2000). The support provided under the scheme can potentially mitigate such shocks. The results also show that children in poorer households benefit less in terms of improvement in health outcomes, though, the differences are not statistically significant. The direction of these results is in accordance with previous findings on cash transfers related to institutional deliveries in India (Debnath, 2021) which show a larger effect for relatively wealthier households.====This study fits in the broader literature on policies that improve birth outcomes. There are many instruments within cash transfers which can lead to improved child health outcomes at birth — income support through Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs), unconditional maternity benefits and conditional maternity benefits. CCTs are re-distributive programs which provide cash to households conditional upon certain actions being fulfilled i.e., the government only transfers the money to persons who meet certain criteria and not universally. This is to encourage behaviors which are beneficial for the long term human capital gains of the household. For instance, one of the earliest CCTs was ==== in Mexico, launched in 1997, which provides cash transfers to poor rural households conditional on their children attending school and the household visiting local health centers regularly.====The effect of such general CCTs on poverty, its inter-generational transmission and child health has been well studied. Most studies find a reduction in poverty, an increase in school participation and an improvement in utilization of health and nutrition services while the effects on child health outcomes are generally mixed.==== However, for general CCTs, it is difficult to disentangle which part of the scheme was effective (if any) since many requirements are bundled together. There are few studies which look at the causal effect of in-utero exposure to these temporary income enhancing CCTs on birth outcomes (Barber and Gertler, 2010, Attanasio et al., 2005). While improved financial resources can increase nutrition and healthcare access, it can also lead to a reduction in labor supply by parents or an increase in consumption of addictive substances.====Direct maternity benefits are another form of cash transfers which have been experimented with. These are either unconditional cash transfers for each birth or conditional on certain requirements being fulfilled by the household. On unconditional transfers, Currie and Cole (1993) find no effect on birth weight of ==== transfers while Amarante et al. (2016) and Aguero et al. (2006) find a decrease in the incidence of low birth weight due to a social assistance program in Uruguay called ==== and an improvement in HAZ due to South Africa’s unconditional ====, respectively.====On the other hand, conditional maternity benefits programs have been relatively less studied. Soares et al. (2010) evaluate one such program in Brazil and finds no effect on immunization because of supply side constraints in medical health centers and hence, no consequent health impacts on children.==== The impact of conditional maternity support schemes in developing countries is bound by the availability of infrastructure to meet the stated conditions, timeliness of payments and whether families use the transfers to improve maternal nutrition. Another related study by Ghosh and Kochar (2018) on ==== (IGMSY), a scheme similar to ====, in select districts of Bihar, a state of India, finds positive effects on long-run health outcomes. The scheme was not implemented well and hence the mechanism for their findings is not the scheme but a delay in implementation of the scheme (after announcement) which led the households to postpone their first or next child, thus, increasing birth spacing.====Existing evidence shows that only policies and expenditure cannot bring an improvement in health outcomes unless accompanied by favorable institutional factors (Rajkumar and Swaroop, 2008). Our paper is the first to evaluate the effect of ==== - a maternity benefits scheme that was implemented relatively well (Ali et al., 2018, Khera, 2015, Raghunathan et al., 2017) - on short-run and long-run health outcomes. It is implemented in the state of Odisha in India, which has a robust public health infrastructure in rural areas (Thomas et al., 2015) and therefore supply side constraints are weaker in our context. A previous study by Raghunathan et al. (2017), which collects primary data on access to MAMATA, also finds a positive effect of this program on uptake of vaccinations and iron supplements by women using a nearest-neighbor matching approach in a cross-sectional setting. However, Raghunathan et al. (2017) do not examine the effects of the scheme on infant and neonatal mortality, birth weight, breastfeeding or long term anthropometric measures. Thus, our paper extends the literature by estimating the impacts of the scheme on child health outcomes at birth and in the long term. Further, we report the effects on direct outcomes like mortality, WAZ and HAZ as well as on outcomes like birth weight which is measured through a health card or is self-reported and breastfeeding months which are exclusively self-reported.====Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it exploits in-utero exposure to a conditional maternity support scheme. There were no other accompanying conditions for the household to receive a cash transfer through another component. This furthers our understanding about the exact design of the scheme which can lead to more favorable birth outcomes in developing countries. Soares et al. (2010) and Ghosh and Kochar (2018) are few studies evaluating conditional maternity support, which either find no effects due to supply side constraints or positive effects through delayed child birth when the scheme was implemented patchily. An advantage of our study is that the scheme was well implemented. Thus, our paper sheds light on how similarly designed schemes can have differential impacts depending on the institutional factors at play. Additionally, the data allow us to look at the effects on breastfeeding, an outcome which has not been studied in the literature but is often a component of counseling sessions.==== Second, apart from the targeted outcomes of the program, we also look at the effects on long-run health outcomes of children. Last, and more broadly, it furthers our understanding about the design of maternity benefits that can lead to more tangible health effects. While unconditional cash transfers during maternity have been shown to have little effect, our study shows that conditional cash transfers during maternity can positively impact child health outcomes when accompanied by favorable institutional factors i.e., when supply of healthcare is not a constraint.====Section 2 discusses the ==== scheme and Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 details the empirical strategy. Main results are discussed in Section 5 along with robustness checks and heterogeneity in the obtained estimates.

In a two-step panel estimation procedure that uses data from 130 countries over the period 2005–2015, I find that the income effects of legal reforms in property rights institutions vary with the prevalent quality of legal contracting institutions and vice versa. Decomposing the interaction effects for groups of countries with different quality combinations reveals that the quality fit of the two types of institutions matters for not only the size but also the direction of the interaction effects. In countries with absent or bad legal institutions, legal reforms considering only one type can even reduce income. Piecemeal reforms work best when they close quality gaps and they can backfire when the gap widens. The findings remain robust after tackling endogeneity issues, extending the period of analysis, estimating alternative models, and using alternative estimators. The findings imply that legal reforms have to be coordinated across different types of institutions and consider possible interferences with extra-legal rules and practices.","The state plays a crucial role in the building of institutions that North (1991):97 defines as ====. It has the authority to issue and enforce laws and regulations that put incentives and constraints on a wide area of human interaction. Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) open ==== with a reference to North (1981), pointing at two spheres of state regulation that ascribe the state a different role for organizing national economies: The first, the “predatory theory” of the state, emphasizes the state’s role in distributing political power and allocating resources in the society, underlining the importance of property rights institutions for economic development (Jones, 2003, De Long and Shleifer, 1993, Olson, 2000, Besley and Ghatak, 2010). The second, the “contract theory” of the state, emphasizes the state’s role in providing a legal framework that enables private contracts and facilitates economic transactions (Coase, 1960, Williamson, 1989), underlining the importance of contracting institutions for economic development (Grossman and Hart, 1986, Hart and Moore, 1990, Hart, 1995).====While Acemoglu and Johnson (2005):950 acknowledge that the state is responsible for providing a legal framework that regulates ==== the distribution of power and resources and the enforcement of private contracts, they ==== In a cross-country study on former European colonies, Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) find strong and significant effects of legal property rights institutions and much weaker and for non-financial outcomes non-significant effects of legal contracting institutions. They conclude that individuals may find informal ways to avoid the adverse effects of a legal system that poorly enforces private contracts but find it harder to mitigate the risk of government expropriation. ==== was a starting point for a number of studies aiming to isolate and compare the economic effects of different types of institutions (Fernandez and Kraay, 2005, Bhattacharyya, 2009, Williamson and Kerekes, 2011, Asongu, 2016).====This study questions the assumption of independent effects and brings the investigation on how property rights and contracting institutions affect economic development back to North (1981), Milgrom and Roberts (1994), Ogilvie and Carus (2014), and towards the Varieties of Capitalism literature (e.g., Soskice and Hall, 2001, Amable, 2003, Rougier, 2015). This stream of literature suggests that it is not single (sets of) institutions but bundles of (sets of) institutions that together and in their combination organize production, exchange, and income distribution. Voigt and Gutmann (2013) have taken one step towards rebundling the effects of legal property rights institutions. They argue that precisely defined property rights are unlikely to have any income effects unless accompanied by some credible commitment of the government to enforce the rights. Voigt and Gutmann (2013) provide empirical evidence that property rights increase growth rates only if the judicial system is independent enough to guarantee their enforcement. This paper goes further and provides arguments and empirical evidence that implementing or improving the legal enforcement of property rights does not suffice to spur economic development and can be ineffective – even countereffective – when a legal enforcement of private contracts is absent or of bad quality. This is because property rights and contracting institutions provide interrelated incentives and constraints on economic decisions and productive activities. A lack in the specification and enforcement of only one type of institutions as well as a poor fit of the incentives and constraints they provide inhibit private investment and therefore economic development.====I draw on data from 130 countries and implement a two-step panel estimation procedure to test the hypothesis that property rights and contracting institutions are jointly effective. The two-step estimation strategy builds on growth theory and allows different channels and timespans of effects. In the first step, I use a fixed effects (FE) least squares estimator to identify short-term individual and interaction effects of legal property rights and contracting institutions on real GDP per capita levels whilst controlling for country-specific unobserved heterogeneity, time, and a set of control variables. In the second step, I use a between effects (BE) least squares estimator to identify individual and interaction effects of legal property rights and contracting institutions on countries’ long-term income levels. I use the estimate of the country-specific unobserved heterogeneity term obtained in the first-step regression as a proxy for countries’ long-term income levels. I follow Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) in the choice of measures of property rights and contracting institutions. I use Polity IV’s variable ==== as baseline measure of legal property rights institutions and the World Bank’s indicator ==== as baseline measure of legal contracting institutions.====The baseline estimation results and a number of robustness tests support the hypothesis of joint effects. I find positive individual and interaction effects of legal property rights and contracting institutions on countries’ long-term income levels, all at considerable sizes and statistically highly significant. The marginal effects of increases in executive constraints on income levels vary to a considerable degree among countries in both direction and size dependent on how efficiently the prevalent legal system enforces private contracts. Moreover, and building on Djankov et al. (2003), who find systematic differences in the quality of the legal system dependent on the legal origin, I find significantly smaller marginal effects of increases in executive constraints for countries with a French legal origin. In 27 sample countries, the marginal effects are even negative.====Decomposing the interaction effects for groups of countries with different quality combinations confirms negative marginal effects of increases in executive constraints for 23 countries with absent or bad legal qualities of both types of institutions. This concerns Sub-Saharan African and Asian but also North African and Middle East countries at lower levels of economic development and implies that if extra-legal rules and practices organize a society, legal reforms in single institutions can backfire. This result relates to literature on lawlessness (Dixit, 2011) and second-best institutions (Rodrik, 2008) arguing that piecemeal reforms towards a best practice model can do more harm than good if the installed rules disturb the functioning of prevalent institutional set-ups or if the installed rules are politically captured (Diwan et al., 2019). Yet, the results suggest that piecemeal reforms do work when they close existing quality gaps across institutions. Also, and in accordance with Acemoglu and Johnson (2005), I find that a bad quality of legal property rights institutions constitutes a larger bottleneck for economic development compared to a bad quality of legal contracting institutions. Italy, India, and some Latin American countries seem to have found extra-legal ways to enforce private contracts that work with legal property rights institutions. In Western democracies, good legal qualities of both types of institutions have generated large positive interaction effects that have significantly contributed to raising long-term income levels.====The study is structured as follows: In Section 2, I discuss why the assumption of independent effects of property rights and contracting institutions is too strong. In Section 3, I make theoretical considerations on the channels and timespans of effects, discuss estimation challenges, and present the identification strategy and the empirical models. In Section 4, I address issues that are considered in the choice of the institutional measures and describe the dataset. In Section 5, I present the baseline and decomposition estimation results. In Section 6, I present the robustness tests.

Applying two-stage structural gravity estimations, we assess the impact of topography on trade by combining worldwide, European, and domestic trade data. While border effect estimates remain largely robust, a main part of the historical and contemporaneous trade costs usually attributed to non-contiguity can be accounted for by topography. Finally, counterfactual simulations suggest that positive effects of rivers on trade are less important than negative effects of mountains.","The ==== has been a prominent observation in the trade literature, ever since McCallum (1995) and Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) reported that, controlling for distance, Canadian provinces trade significantly more among themselves than with neighboring U.S. states. The border effect finds its continuation in a ====: again controlling for distance, neighboring countries trade more than non-neighboring countries. Apart from distance, the contiguity effect is the most often estimated coefficient in empirical gravity (Head and Mayer, 2014). Nevertheless, what constitutes the costs of non-contiguity remains so far even less explored than border effects (on the latter, see, e.g., Havranek and Irsova 2017).====Country borders are at least partially defined by natural borders, such as rugged or mountainous terrain, rivers and the valleys formed by rivers (Kitamura and Lagerlöf, 2020). Thus, topographical features may be suspected to have an influence on the trade costs of borders. Mountains, or more generally, the ruggedness of terrain, can be expected to restrict trade. Rivers, and the valleys they have formed, may impede or facilitate trade by representing obstacles against but also pathways for trade. In terms of contemporaneous costs, topographical variability affects the construction and maintenance costs of surface transport networks, as well as the costs to users of those networks (Giuliano et al., 2014). The same topographical phenomena, however, may have been at work back in history, with effects that persist until today. To a large extent, trade today is due to the existence of networks formed already in the past (Rauch, 1999). Topography may have favored or hindered the formation of trade creating networks in the past.====While the wider literature on geography and economic activity is sizeable (see Malecki 2015, for a survey), research on how topographical variability affects trade is almost absent. Kocornik-Mina et al. (2020) document that economic activity concentrates in plane environments, often close to rivers or coasts. Amjadi et al. (1996), Gallup et al. (1998), and Limao and Venables (2001) all refer to sub-Saharan Africa to emphasize the importance of physical geography for trade and development. Redding and Venables (2004, p. 110) in particular notice Africa's lack of “east-west navigable rivers to facilitate water-borne trade within the continent …”.====A strand of the literature focuses on history dependence in trade, which is often connected to topography. Bleakley and Lin (2012) observe that many cities in North America were founded at obstacles to water navigation, where continued transport required overland hauling – ====. Although original advantages have long since become obsolete, the authors document continuing importance of historical portage sites and interpret this as path dependence. Barjamovic et al. (2019) investigate commercial trade records from the Bronze Age in modern Turkey, Iraq and Syria. Considering rivers and ruggedness of the terrain, they estimate optimal travel routes and find the relative sizes of ancient cities are explained by their position in the network of these “natural trade routes”. Furthermore, they find a strong correlation between ancient population size and today's economic size, controlling for topography. Flückiger et al. (2022) find that ancient Roman trade routes, including navigable rivers, in Western and Central Europe did influence economic and social integration until at least the Industrial Revolution. In our analysis, we acknowledge the importance of path dependencies when analyzing the effect of geographic attributes on trade. However, we do not try to explain historical dependence in international trade, but merely account for it to disentangle past and contemporaneous effects of geography.====We therefore embed the question for the nature of border costs into a broader analysis of topography and trade, in particular rivers and mountains, and ask two major questions: How much of the cost of borders in Europe can be accounted for by topographical variation? Are these costs contemporary or do they represent persistent historical effects on trade? We use original data and recent methods to answer these questions. We expand the bilateral geographical CEPII-database by adding detailed novel primary data on bilateral river borders and river connections for 1260 unidirectional European country pairs. In addition, we use data from Nunn and Puga (2012) to construct a new indicator for the ruggedness of trade routes. Building on a new worldwide manufacturing trade database, including countries’ domestic trade, in a two-stage structural gravity framework, we assess the impact of topography on European trade flows. Our results indicate that the European river network along and across country borders exerts a positive effect on European trade. This effect is due to the existence of river valleys rather than to rivers ====, i.e., it is independent from specific modes of transport chosen along or across river valleys. Trade impeding mountains are much more important than rivers, to a large degree due to historical persistence. While border effect estimates remain largely robust against variations in topography, much of the historical trade costs that are attributed to non-contiguity are in fact due to topography. Once we control for topography, the contemporary costs attributed to non-contiguity become very small and insignificant.====We also present counterfactual simulations to suggest that the positive effects of rivers on European trade are less important – and also less persistent – than the negative effects of mountains. As a corollary, we suggest that historically topography may have contributed to the marginalization of southeastern Europe in European trade.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we motivate our structural gravity approach and discuss our model selection. In Section 3, we introduce our unique data set. Section 4 presents our benchmark results, in Section 5, we check for their robustness. In Section 6, we tackle the question whether the topographical effects found in our benchmark results are contemporaneous trade costs or rather represent historical legacies. To do so, we introduce a new approach to differentiate between past ==== contemporaneous trade costs. In Section 7, we present counterfactual analyses of shutting river valleys and flattening Europe. Section 8 concludes.

This shape looks puzzling since it differs starkly from that observed in both developed and developing countries. We show that a proper interpretation of the wage–experience profile is hindered by the age-period-cohort problem, when the effects of time, cohort, and experience on the wage growth are mixed. Our study uses survey data from Russia covering the years 2000–2019. Relying on ====, we disentangle the experience, period and cohort effects. With certain assumptions concerning human capital depreciation due to aging, our results show that Russian wages do grow monotonically with experience. However, this growth after mid-career is offset by the cohort effect that proceeds in the opposite direction, thus reflecting massive obsolescence of the human capital of workers from older cohorts. Meanwhile, the time effect mirrors the general GDP path as well as all booms and busts over the period.","The positive and concave relationship between log earnings and experience has been, starting probably with the seminal work of J. Mincer, and still is one of the stylized facts of labor economics. As Mincer wrote, “The basic features of the age profiles are easily summarized: except for the initial years of gainful activity, earnings are higher at higher levels of schooling, and increase with age through much of the working life. The absolute and, more consistently, relative rate of increase in annual earnings diminishes with age, becoming negative, if it changes at all, during the last decade of working life. There is no visible decline at these later ages in weekly earnings. Apparently, declines in weeks worked per year are the main factor in the decline of annual earnings during the preretirement years” (Mincer, 1974). Twenty years later, Neumark (1995) mentioned that the rising and concave earnings profile over much of the life-cycle is “one of the most robust findings in labor economics”. Almost all documented evidence on the wage growth profiles have overwhelmingly verified early findings of the increasing and concave relationship between earnings and age/experience (Hutchens, 1989; Johnson and Neumark, 1996; Rubinstein and Weiss, 2006; Myck, 2010; Paccagnella, 2016, among many others). Lagakos et al. (2018) show the same increasing and concave earnings–experience relationship for a handful of both developed and developing countries. Countries differ in profile steepness, not in shape. The conventional profile was confirmed once again in a large-scale cross-country study of the World Bank (see Jedwab et al., 2021).====The consensus view has a well-established basis also in theory. On the theoretical side, as pointed out by Rubinstein and Weiss (2006) in their thorough review of the literature, virtually all well-established theories have similar predictions regarding the shape of the post-school wage growth. Both the human capital theory, which was the original source of inspiration for Mincer's work, and search and matching models make similar predictions regarding the overall shape of wage profiles over the life cycle. The same is true for agency models with deterred remuneration in which employers need time to learn about the true ability of workers.====One of methodological problems of exploring the wage-experience profile is strong multicollinearity of age-period-cohort, known as the APC problem. Any cross-sectional wage–experience profile mixes two different effects. One reflects the actual effect of experience (or age with which it correlates) brought by the human capital accumulation and depreciation. The other one mirrors belonging to particular cohorts. That is, the effect of skills, ideas, values, and norms of that time when individuals are socialized, educated, and enter the labor market. Growing up during a recession or boom, or under a particular politico-institutional regime can make a difference (Giuliano and Spilimbergo, 2014; Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln, 2007). We also see a mix when we follow the wage evolution within the same cohort; in this case, the effects of experience and time go closely intertwined.====While in the developed economies the cohort effect does not change much the observed cross-sectional profiles, in the transition economies it may introduce considerable distortions (see Fang and Qui, 2021). Therefore, the wage-experience profiles in post-transition countries are likely to differ from those in both advanced and developing economies. The shape of profile can illuminate how human capital can accumulate and be used under different politico-economic regimes. The transition from the planned to a market economy strongly affected the previously accumulated human capital and its further production and utilization. As a result, much of the human capital in the form of knowledge and skills became obsolete and was offered at much lower market prices. The cohort effect is expected to mirror this process.====This paper focuses on Russia, the largest and most populated country in the post-socialist world. Some empirical evidence documents early peak and then rapid decline in the evolution of Russian wages (Gimpelson and Kapeliushnikov, 2011; Gimpelson, 2019 Zinchenko, 2019; Gimpelson and Zinchenko, 2019). This pattern diverges from the stylized one.====If the existing cross-sectional evidence was interpreted as showing how wages evolve over the working life, it would suggest that the loss of the Russian human capital, owing to depreciation, starts too early and is not compensated by new investments in education and skills. There is evidence in favor of this interpretation. According to Gimpelson (2019), Russian workers receive little on-the-job training, have low wage-enhancing job mobility in later years of the career (Gimpelson et al., 2016b), and experience age-related health problems that affect productivity (Kaneva et al., 2019). Still, all these reasons do not seem to be convincing enough for explaining such drastic and early wage decline that we have been observing in the data. Many countries facing the same problems exhibit quite conventional wage profiles. We argue that the observed patterns reflect the effects of shocks induced by the systemic change (the transition) and by the subsequent crises which accompanied the Russian economic development over all the 90 s.====Our analysis utilizes a series of cross-sections from the 2000–2019 Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE). At first glance, the “raw” profile, without controlling for other characteristics and without separating the APC effects, looks rather flat and does not show an expected increase in wages with experience. Moreover, workers’ earnings by the end of their working career appear to be significantly lower than earnings observed in the middle of the life cycle. Profiles separated by education, as well as those obtained using the Mincer equation, tell us a similar story. This depicts a situation that differs significantly from that observed in advanced market economies. However, the separation of the APC effects may give a clue to this seemingly non-standard pattern. The strong cohort effect, acting oppositely to the experience/age effect, nets out the latter and makes the “raw” profile flat and decreasing during the second half of working life.====For disentangling the APC effects, we employ the idea suggested by Heckman et al. (1998) that relies on life-cycle predictions of the human capital theory (Ben-Porath, 1967). According to this idea, human capital investments depend on the period over which individuals expect to gain returns. As an individual approaches retirement age, the period of return shortens, disincentivizing further human capital investments. Therefore, the effect of experience on wage growth without additional investments tends to evaporate. Looking at this pre-retirement period from within a cohort, we set the cohort effect to zero. Thus, the whole observed wage growth within this spell can be attributed to the time effect plus the depreciation of the existing human capital stock. Once the time trend is identified, the other two effects can also be derived. Lagakos et al. (2018) put this idea to the test by using large empirical data sets.====We contribute to the discussion on human capital accumulation in the post-transition countries by disentangling the effects of experience, cohort, and time for Russia. To our knowledge, this study is among the first that separates these effects for a transition country. Our results suggest that cross-sectional evidence may exaggerate the extent of aging-driven human capital destruction. As we show, the early peak and decline in the Russian wage profile hide a superposition of experience and cohort effects that act in the opposite directions. While a longer labor market experience boosts the human capital and, correspondingly, wages, belonging to older cohorts nets out these advantages. We suggest that this reflects the obsolescence of knowledge and skills acquired by individuals before or at the early stages of their transition to the market economy. Our results call for a deeper analysis of how older cohorts, that gained their experience working in the planned economy, adapt to the new market conditions.====The paper is structured in the following way. It consists of seven sections, including the introduction and conclusion. In Section 2, we overview relevant theoretical and empirical literature. In particular, we explain in detail how the experience, cohort, and time effects can be interpreted and understood. Section 3 provides a concise insight into the post-soviet development of the Russian labor market and its implications for wage growth. Section 4 introduces the data sets and main variables of interest. In Section 5, we present and discuss empirical results.

In the short run, we find a positive and significant effect of Protestant churches on women’s literacy and employment, but not on men’s. After almost a century, we find no strong relationship between historical Protestant churches and women’s educational attainment or economic and political empowerment.","The Protestant church has historically played an important role in promoting education, especially for females (Becker and Woessmann, 2008, Becker and Woessmann, 2009). During the age of colonialism, Christian missionaries spread the Gospel around the world, often maintaining a close cooperative relationship with colonial states as incubators of Western norms and values (Montgomery, 2017, Becker, 2022). A growing body of research indicates that the presence of Protestant missionaries is associated with better female educational outcomes and other forms of empowerment in former European colonies, in both the colonial and post-colonial periods (Lankina and Getachew, 2013, Nunn, 2014, Calvi et al., 2022). However, little is known about whether Protestant missions have such long-lasting impacts when they do not share common cultural and religious origins with colonial rulers, as is the case on the Korean peninsula.====In this paper, we examine this question by estimating the short- and long-run impacts of Protestantism on human capital and female empowerment in present-day South Korea. American Protestant missionaries arrived in Korea in 1884 and spread the Gospel while providing medical and educational services to locals in the early years. Protestantism steadily increased the number of its followers during the Japanese colonial period (1910–1945), and about 1.5 percent of the Korean population were Protestants in 1940.==== The growth of Protestantism in the post-colonial period is even more substantial, and the figure had grown to 19.7 percent in 2015,==== making South Korea the largest Protestant country in Asia.==== Nevertheless, there is scant empirical evidence on whether and how historical exposure to Protestantism influenced female educational attainment and empowerment in the past century.====Historically and similarly to many Asian countries, Korean society was heavily influenced by Confucianism, which had been the state ideology of the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910) for about 500 years before the arrival of Protestantism. According to the ideals of Confucianism, women’s economic and social roles were strictly limited to within the household, and most women lacked basic literacy skills, as they had little access to formal educational institutions or informal village schools. However, as literacy skills were necessary for reading the Korean-translated Bible, early Protestant missionary work, mostly led by foreign female missionaries, devoted a significant amount of effort toward educating women through local church Bible groups and missionary schools. These trained local women, referred to in the missions literature as “Bible women”, went from one village to another serving other women and children and spreading the Gospel.====To investigate the effect of historical exposure to Protestantism, we construct a novel historical dataset that contains information on religious facilities, demographics, and geographic variables covering all townships in Korea from the past century.==== Specifically, we digitized archival maps and Japanese colonial records on Protestant missions and churches in Korea during the period 1884–1915. These data are combined with fine-grained information on human capital and socioeconomic characteristics collected from population censuses in 1930 and 2010. We also exploit information on economic and political empowerment and gender norms from social surveys collected between 2000 and 2018. Before gaining access to restricted datasets for long-term analyses, we carefully designed and preregistered a pre-analysis plan for examining long-run outcomes.====Our identification strategy relies on the variation in historical exposure to Protestantism, measured by the number of Protestant churches in 1915, across 1534 townships in South Korea. In our regression equations, we control for county fixed effects, which account for any unobservable differences across counties. Therefore, the identification assumption is that the spread of Protestantism is as good as random across townships within counties. Exploiting a rich set of geographic and socioeconomic characteristics of townships, we corroborate this assumption by showing that, within counties, the establishment of early Protestant churches is unrelated to a series of observable township characteristics. In addition, to support our causal interpretation, we conduct robustness tests by utilizing a wide range of historical controls that cover the demographic, spatial, and economic characteristics of townships.====The estimation results on the short-run impact show that the female illiteracy rate in 1930 is significantly lower in townships with more Protestant churches, while there is no such relationship for the male illiteracy rate.==== This is consistent with prior studies that have shown positive impacts of Protestantism on human capital accumulation in different contexts, especially for females (Lankina and Getachew, 2013, Nunn, 2014, Calvi et al., 2022). Examining the channels, we also find that while the female illiteracy rate is lower in townships with more female-only missionary schools, these schools do not fully account for the relationship between Protestant churches and the illiteracy rate. This suggests that local Protestant churches may have affected female literacy through other channels. We provide anecdotal evidence on the influential role of Korean Bible women in raising female literacy and spreading the Gospel to local communities, especially to women and girls.====Turning to short-run impacts on labor market activities, we find a significantly higher employment rate in 1930 for females, but not for males, in townships with more Protestant churches. The increase in the female employment rate is sizable: one additional Protestant church is associated with a 0.75 percentage point increase in female employment in an economy in which only 28.3 percent of females have a job. Consistent with the employment results, we also find a significantly lower marriage rate in townships with more Protestant churches. However, we find no such effects from other religions, such as Catholic churches or Japanese Shinto shrines, suggesting that the increase in literacy is unique to activities conducted at Protestant churches. This set of results indicates that Protestant churches may have played an important role in facilitating the empowerment of Korean women during the early 20th century.====Despite the positive empowering impact of Protestant churches for females in the short run, we find no significant relationship between historical exposure to Protestant churches and females’ educational attainment, employment, and political participation today. First, using the 2010 population census, we find a precisely estimated zero effect on educational attainment, measured by years of education, for both females and males. Second, we use social survey data to estimate the impact of historical exposure to Protestantism on employment and participation in elections and political rallies and find no significant impact for females.==== However, we find that females in regions with more historical Protestant churches are more likely to possess gender-equal norms than females in regions with fewer historical Protestant churches. In contrast, male gender norms do not show a significant relationship with historical Protestant churches.====We discuss several potential reasons that may explain the lack of long-run impacts. First, as the short-term success in improving female literacy appears to be predominantly through informal channels such as the activities of Bible women, their impacts could easily have been diminished once the public educational system was rapidly expanded in Korea. Second, rapid economic growth brought about structural changes and improved employment opportunities for women, which could have also weakened the long-term economic impacts of historical exposure to Protestantism. Third, Confucian-based social norms were deeply rooted in Korea long before the arrival of Christianity. Therefore, it is possible that the influence of Christianity is limited to changing the gender attitudes of individual women, and has not changed the gender norms of society as a whole.====We contribute to the literature on the role of religion in economic history and other social sciences (Iyer, 2016, Becker et al., 2021). A number of studies highlight the importance of Protestantism for various outcomes such as human capital accumulation (Boppart et al., 2013), demographic transition (Becker et al., 2010), and economic development (Becker et al., 2011). Furthermore, studies on religious missions have shown that Christian missionaries spread schooling and literacy outside Europe (Gallegoa and Woodberry, 2010, Waldinger, 2017), contributing to long-run economic development (Bai and Kung, 2015, Caicedo, 2018), state building (Dulay, 2022), and democratic development (Lankina and Getachew, 2012, Woodberry, 2012). Along this line, studies have shown that the effects of missions are often gendered. While Montgomery (2017) has shown that historical exposure to Catholic missionaries is associated with greater gender inequality in German East Africa, an increasing number of studies have shown that women benefited more from Protestant missions in India (Lankina and Getachew, 2013, Calvi et al., 2022) and in Africa (Nunn, 2014), which is consistent with the fact that Protestantism advocated for female literacy so that women could read the Gospel (Becker and Woessmann, 2008).====Along this line, the study closest to ours is Becker and Won (2021). Using county-level data from Korea, they find that a higher share of Christian priests is associated with a higher literacy rate in 1930, which is consistent with our findings on the short-term effects. Our paper differs from their study in several ways, however. First, we examine not only the literacy rate but also economic and demographic outcomes in 1930. Second, we examine the effects of Protestantism not only in the short term but also over the long term. Third, we take advantage of a geographically granular (township-level) dataset and exploit within-county variation for identification. We also include an extensive set of control variables from a newly digitized historical map. This could better mitigate a concern for endogenous determination of Protestantism. Finally, we directly measure the exposure to different Christian denominations (Catholicism and Protestantism) by utilizing novel data on the number of churches by denomination, while Becker and Won (2021) imputes the share of Protestant and Catholic priests at the county-level, assuming that the share of Protestant and Catholic priests is constant across counties within provinces.====We contribute to this literature in several ways. First, we advance the knowledge of the short-term impacts of religious missions on human capital accumulation by exploring the mechanisms. Our findings on the mechanisms of the short-term impacts of Protestantism suggest that formal education at missionary schools does not fully explain the short-term effects on human capital accumulation and rather suggest the importance of informal channels such as the activities of Bible women.====Second, by showing that historical exposure to Protestantism has no long-run effects on contemporary female educational attainment as well as economic and political participation despite the short-run positive effects on females, our paper brings a new insight to the literature that the long-run mission effects are conditional. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully identify the conditions that resulted in the absence of long-run effects, we discuss potentially important conditions, such as organization of the mission, post-independence development, and pre-existing social norms.====This relates to the third contribution of our paper: we provide the first empirical analysis of the long-run effects of Christian missions in a country that was colonized by a non-Western, non-Christian power. In European colonies, Christian missions were often an integral part of the colonial system, contributing to the legitimization of colonialism, the development of human capital among locals, and the imposition of cultural policies (Montgomery, 2017). In return, colonial government often supported missionary work by providing military protection and financial support (Becker, 2022). In contrast, the Japanese colonial institution was distinct from the institution of Protestant religious missions (Protestant mission groups from the United States and Canada). This provides a unique setting for studying the persistent effects of religious missions in the absence of synergistic interaction between colonial power and religious missionaries.====Last but not least, by incorporating a pre-analysis plan as part of the research design, we also contribute to recent developments on credible research designs in studies of persistence in economic history (Voth, 2021).====Beyond the studies on religion, this paper also relates to the literature on female empowerment, particularly in less developed economies, where there are large gender gaps in many domains (Doepke et al., 2012, Duflo, 2012). Studies have shown that, while economic growth can itself promote women’s empowerment, gender-biased cultural norms can be a hindrance (Jayachandran, 2015); thus, there is ample scope for gender-focused interventions to help close the gender gaps, such as political quotas (Beaman et al., 2009), property rights (Roy, 2015), and the media (Jensen and Oster, 2009). This paper adds to this literature by examining the role of religion along these lines. Another strand of the literature on gender gaps studies their historical roots, and has shown that historical conditions, such as technology adoption (Alesina et al., 2013, Hansen et al., 2015, Xue, 2020), sex ratio (Grosjean and Khattar, 2019, Teso, 2019), and state regimes (Campa and Serafinell, 2019) are important in shaping today’s gender roles. We join this line of research by studying the long-term impact of Protestant missionary work for women on female empowerment.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the historical background on women’s status in Korea and Protestant missions. Section 3 describes the key data sources that we use for our main analysis. In Sections 4 Short-run impact of Protestant churches, 5 Long-run impact of Protestant churches, we present the results of our empirical analysis on the short- and long-term impacts of Protestant churches, respectively. Section 6 concludes.","The effects of South Korean Protestantism on human capital and female empowerment, 1930–2010",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596723000082,16 February 2023,2023,Research Article,17.0

To identify TV's effects, we rely on a unique quasi-natural experiment related to the division of Germany after WWII until 1990 into West Germany with a free market economy and the socialist East Germany where starting one's own business was not permitted. Despite this division, Western TV was exogeneously available since the 1960s in some, but not all East German regions and conveyed images and attitudes conducive to entrepreneurship. We use both regional-level and geo-referenced individual-level data and show that since starting a business in East Germany became possible thanks to the reunification in 1990, entrepreneurship incidence is higher in East German regions that had Western TV signal. This indicates a first-order effect on directly exposed individuals. We show that this is due to the effects of Western TV on attitudes and value orientations associated with entrepreneurship, particularly independence. We find no indication that the differences in the entrpreneurship incidence of East German regions with and without Western TV disappear. Instead, we find that successive cohorts and descendants of directly exposed individuals who were not directly exposed themselves more frequently wish to become entrepreneurs. The latter findings are consistent with second-order effects due to intergenerational transmission of an entrepreneurial mindset and suggest that a self-sustaining entrepreneurial culture can be formed. This can cause long-lasting differences between treated and non-treated population groups or regions.","Entrepreneurship is considered a key driver of growth and development in free market economies. Entrepreneurs address unserved demands, introduce new products or create new markets, eventually deploying resources more efficiently. Productive entries will deploy further production factors, exhibit growth, and challenge other firms. However, even entries that turn out to be less productive, do not grow or even exit, can have positive effects on the economy, e.g., by disciplining competitors or showing what works versus what does not. Along this line of reasoning, each entering cohort has a positive impact at the aggregate level. Overall, the entrepreneurial process—through continuous trial and error and discovery—increases variety, stiffens competition, amplifies innovation, accelerates change and development, and improves resource allocation, which ultimately results in productivity gains, job creation, and welfare increases in the long run (Decker et al., 2014; Fritsch et al., 2005; Fritsch et al., 2010; Schumpeter 1912, 1942; Baumol 1990, 2010; Baumol et al., 1988; Baumol et al., 2007). However, the entrepreneurial act itself is not always self-evident but requires a proactive mindset and cannot be fully explained within the standard economic framework (Schumpeter 1912). Thus, understanding what determines entrepreneurial identity is crucial for understanding growth and development and designing policies.====In this paper, we empirically analyze whether individuals’ decisions to start businesses can be influenced by television (TV). TV can shape career choices by conveying information and pointing to business opportunities or showcasing entrepreneurship as an alternative to dependent employment. Moreover, TV can influence career decisions by transmitting images that affect viewers’ preferences and the esteem of occupations. On the one hand, the empirical literature on the determinants of entrepreneurship shows that personality characteristics (i.e., attitudes, values, preferences, and aspirations) play a significant role in the decision to start a business (Arenius and Minniti 2005; Hamilton 2000; Hyytinen et al., 2013; Berglann et al., 2011; Croson and Minniti 2012; Benz and Frey 2008a, b; M. van Gelderen and Jansen 2006). Akerlof and Kranton (2000) argue that an individuals’ identity, namely their self-perception or sense of self, influences their behavior and preference toward a specific occupation. Individuals reap utility not only from monetary outcomes but also from acting in a certain way, in particular, according to their ideal view of themselves and what they should or should not do to live up to their ideal concept of the self (Akerlof and Kranton 2000; Benz and Frey 2008a, M. b). Accordingly, values, preferences, status, and esteem attached to different occupations and career paths shape individuals’ decisions. On the other hand, research has also indicated that TV can shape—deliberately or not—individuals’ view of the self while transmitting images that create specific attitudes, values, and preferences. Specifically, TV viewers can identify with fictitious or real media characters and role models and adopt (parts of) their personality and behavior (A. Bandura 2001; Rosengren and Windahl 1972; Cohen 2001; Adams-Price and Greene 1990; Hoffner and Buchanan 2005). The identification process can extend well beyond the viewing situation (i.e., sharing emotions while watching). It can lead to durable changes in attitudes, values, or aspirations and, therefore, identity and behavior (Rosengren et al., 1976; Bandura 1986; A. 2001; v. Feilitzen and Linne 1975; Hoffner 1996; Hoffner and Buchanan 2005).====To identify the effect of TV on entrepreneurship, we utilize an exogenous variation in the exposure of East German regions since the 1960s until 1989, where entrepreneurship was demonized, to West German public TV that conveyed images generally conducive to entrepreneurship. We apply econometric techniques to analyze whether the differential West German TV exposure until 1989 “translates” to regional differences in the entrepreneurship incidence in the period after the reunification of the two German states in 1990, when starting an own business in East Germany became possible again. Specifically, after WWII and until the reunification in 1990, Germany was divided into West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany, FRG), which had a free market economy, and East Germany (German Democratic Republic, GDR), which had adopted socialism. In West Germany, according to the official doctrine, TV conveyed the notion that individuals were free and responsible for their own lives and that experimentation, self-discovery, self-realization, and proactive behavior were desirable from an individual and social point-of-view. In East Germany, per socialist doctrine, private capital and entrepreneurship were banned and socially stigmatized; the economy was state-driven, and starting a business became possible only after the reunification with West Germany in 1990 and the concomitant adoption of the free market system. However, despite the division, the West German public TV signal was available to most East German regions since the 1960s. A few East German regions never had access to West German TV solely due to topological reasons.====We are interested in whether entrepreneurship incidence is higher among individuals exposed to West German TV (“treated”) than among those non-exposed (“non-treated”). West German TV's impact on entrepreneurial success or performance is not clear. There is no evidence that West German TV impacted the entrepreneurial abilities of individuals, for instance by informing them how to start and run a company successfully. Instead, evidence suggests that West German TV promoted attitudes conducive to entrepreneurship. We are interested in whether the potential differences between treated and non-treated groups of individuals or regions fade or endure over time and the underlying mechanisms. On the one hand, the effects of the temporary TV treatment will disappear if these are confined to only directly exposed individuals and the last exposed cohort exceeds a certain age. On the other hand, there may be second-order effects due to an intergenerational transmission of an entrepreneurial mindset, which may trigger a self-sustaining entrepreneurial culture and cause long-lasting differences between population groups or regions. For instance, individuals becoming entrepreneurs may signal to subsequent cohorts that entrepreneurship is a viable alternative to dependent employment (Halaby 2003). A higher incidence of entrepreneurship may remove biases and stigma, stimulate its societal legitimacy, and pave the way for future cohorts (Etzioni 1987; Kibler et al., 2014). Subsequent generations notice their ascendants’ behaviors and likely view them as role models, consciously or not, adopting their norms, values, and preferences (Bandura 1986). Moreover, individuals may deliberately exert effort to disseminate their attitudes to future generations (i) if they believe their value system to be superior and reap benefits from their descendants’ behavior and well-being (Bisin and Verdier 2000; A. 2001), or (ii) because of bounded rationality and subjective biases over occupational alternatives (Chakraborty et al., 2016; Corneo and Jeanne 2010). We use both data at the level of NUTS3 regions (i.e., counties) as well as geo-referenced individual-level data that allow us to illuminate the underlying mechanisms.====Our analysis shows that TV exposure influences individuals’ decisions to start businesses. We regress the annual number of new businesses per working-age population in East German regions from 1993–2016 on a binary time-invariant indicator for the regional availability of West German public TV signal before the reunification in 1990. We find that entrepreneurship incidence is more than 10 percent higher in East German regions exposed to West German TV than in regions without exposure. As detailed in the identification strategy below (cf., Section 4), we use various identification strategies and robustness checks to alleviate concerns of confounded and inconsistent estimates potentially due to unobserved regional characteristics correlated with local entrepreneurship and TV availability. Individual-level data analysis confirms that the residents of East German regions exposed to West German TV are more likely to start businesses after the reunification in 1990. Moreover, we find that, in 1990, the residents of East German regions exposed to West German TV valued independence more than those of East German regions not exposed to West German TV. These findings are consistent with Western TV's promotion of attitudes that shape the entrepreneurial identity of individuals. This points to the micro-level mechanisms underlying TV's effects and further helps alleviate concerns that unobserved regional factors confound the results, thus generally strengthening a causal interpretation.====We find that the differences between treated and non-treated regions remain significant even after 25 years, though initially they slightly increase and later slightly decrease. Then, based on individual-level data, we document that the strength of TV's effect measured at a certain point of time depends on individuals’ age. The TV effect is most substantial for the cohort of individuals who, at the time of exposure, were young and likely more susceptible to TV influences and, in the period of analysis, at the age at which the (age-induced) probability of starting a business was comparably high. Within this cohort, we also find the most significant difference in the valuation of independence. We find no statistically significant differences for individuals that were “too old” to start a business during the analysis period. These findings indicate that the hump-shaped temporal pattern of TV's effect is an artifact of different age cohorts “moving” throughout the period of analysis. The findings further suggest that, if only directly exposed individuals are more likely to become entrepreneurs, the differences in the entrepreneurship incidence of East German regions with and without Western TV will disappear when the last directly treated individuals exceed a certain age.====However, we also find evidence consistent with second-order effects due to the intergenerational transmission of a pro-entrepreneurial mindset. In particular, using the individual-level data, we show that individuals born in 1985 or later, who/whose parents lived in 1989 in East German regions with West German TV signal, are more likely to want to start a business than their peers, who/whose parents lived in 1989 in East German regions without TV signal. As differential treatment for this cohort is arguably less likely, finding a TV effect is consistent with a transmission of a mindset conducive to entrepreneurship from one generation to the next. This suggests the development of a self-sustaining entrepreneurial culture that can cause long-lasting differences in the entrepreneurship incidence of treated versus non-treated population groups or regions and explains why the level of entrepreneurship in treated regions remains significantly higher than in non-treated regions.====In conclusion, promoting entrepreneurial identity can increase the entrepreneurial incidence and trigger the formation of an entrepreneurial culture with sustainable effects due to intergenerational transmission. Policies that promote entrepreneurial identity can complement other instruments such as promoting entrepreneurial/managerial skills and financial support (Lerner 2009, 2020). TV can play a role here.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines how this research relates to the existing literature.

This study analyzes how rising political populism in developing countries affects whether their citizens pursue higher education abroad. Applying the Synthetic Control Method, student migration patterns from Hungary, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Indonesia are explored as cases constituting early examples of authoritarian populism. The estimates show that the rise of authoritarianism after the closely contested elections that result in favor of the populist leaders in these countries increases the number of citizens who attend universities in foreign countries. Finding limited evidence for worsening higher education options in the origin countries suggests that more students start pursuing foreign education to increase their chances of living abroad after ====. Emigration of skilled citizens from developing countries as a consequence of political populism is likely to constitute a threat to the economic performance of these countries in the long-term.","Populist ideas have become prevalent all around the world in recent decades, and populist leaders have come into power in various countries, from Hungary and Poland in Europe to Venezuela and Brazil in Latin America and India and Indonesia in Asia.==== Despite differences in opinion among populist leaders about fundamental policy issues, they all claim to defend the interests of “the people” against “the elites” in their country. In their fight against “the elites”, populist leaders have not refrained from attacking the longstanding institutions of their countries. As a result, the eroding of democratic institutions, such as independent courts and free media, and the deterioration of civil liberties, such as the freedom of thought and expression, have been experienced in most of the countries governed by populist leaders.==== Resentment towards such adverse implications of rising political populism have emerged especially among young people. As a manifestation of this discontent, massive demonstrations have taken place in urban centers of many countries with the active participation of young people. However, these protests have mostly been suppressed by force, and the authoritarian tone of populist leaders has intensified over time. Moreover, the economic outlook has deteriorated noticeably over time in some of the countries governed by populist leaders. All these adverse consequences of the rise in political populism in their origin country might cause young people to explore new destinations as countries in which to study and live. In this paper, I analyze how the rise of political populism in a country affects the outmigration of its citizens as international students.====Political populism might increase the tendency to study abroad for two main reasons. First, rising populism in a country might diminish higher education options provided in its universities. In particular, limitations to fully exercising the freedom of thought in teaching might weaken the quality of education. Moreover, in a country with rising populism, hiring new faculty members from abroad and retaining existing faculty members might become more challenging, which consequently impinges on the enrollment capacity of its universities. To cope with these limitations, more students from such countries might prefer to study abroad. Second, a larger number of young people might start planning to live abroad after the election of populist leaders in their country of origin to escape from the deterioration of personal freedoms and economic outlook. For young people with such a plan, education abroad might serve as a pathway to long-term residency in foreign countries. Earlier studies in the literature show that most college-educated immigrants obtained their highest post-secondary degree in the country of destination, and most international students have continued to stay in the destination country after their graduation.==== Given such a strong relationship between foreign education and migration, rising political populism might encourage more students to pursue degrees from foreign universities to increase their likelihood of living abroad.====Although the political discourse of populism and the vote share of populist parties have been on the rise in many countries, including those with a long tradition of democracy, only in a relatively small number of countries have populist leaders obtained the power to govern and the chance to apply their authoritarian policies.==== In this study, I focus on earlier examples of such countries: Hungary, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Indonesia in the 2004–2016 period and analyze student migration from these to countries that were members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In particular, in each of these origin countries, either a new leader was elected or new constitutional amendments that extended the power of an incumbent populist leader were approved approximately during the middle of the analyzed sample period. According to Freedom House data, civil liberties deteriorated in these countries as a result of political changes of this kind. Since these elections were decided in favor of populist leaders by close margins, their results and the associated deterioration of civil liberties can plausibly be considered as events whose outcome was not certain in advance. They can therefore serve as quasi-experiments to explore the effect of rising populism on student migration.====I analyze the effect of the rise of authoritarian populism on student migration in the framework of the Synthetic Control Method (SCM). I select countries located in Europe, the Americas, and Asia with stable levels of civil liberties during the sample period, as a set of potentially comparable countries to construct the synthetic units. Estimates show that the population of students who pursued higher education in foreign OECD countries increased annually by 24.3% in Hungary, 77.3% in Ukraine, 39.3% in Venezuela, and 20.2% in Indonesia after the deterioration of civil liberties in these origin countries compared to the population of international students originating from their synthetic control units. While the results for Hungary, Ukraine, and Venezuela are robust to various empirical specifications, the one for Indonesia is sensitive to the set of countries used as the donor pool.====The lack of information on the intentions of international students in the data presents limitations to identifying the reasons behind the estimated increase in student outmigration. However, the analysis of patterns in student migration by characteristics of destination countries and the analysis of economic outcomes in origin countries provide some insights. In particular, estimates show that more students from the origin countries of interest started attending universities in destinations that were historically less popular and had fewer high-quality universities. Moreover, estimates provide no statistical evidence for worsening higher education options in the origin countries of interest (as measured by the total number of scientific publications by researchers in its universities), except in Venezuela, with respect to their synthetic control units. These findings suggest that a larger number of students started pursuing higher education abroad with the intention of facilitating their migration as workers in their post-graduation period rather than obtaining high-quality education abroad due to worsening higher education options in their origin country. Moreover, the analysis of economic outcomes shows that output per capita and unemployment deteriorate only in Ukraine and Venezuela and only a certain period after the rise in populism. This result suggests that not just deteriorating economic conditions but also increasing authoritarianism in the origin countries grow intentions of living abroad among youth.====A large strand of the literature provides a conceptualization for populism and discusses contemporary examples (for a recent example, see Mudde and Kaltwasser, 2017), and another strand analyzes potential reasons for the rise of political populism (for a review of this literature, see Guriev and Papaioannou, 2022). There is also a growing body of the literature that explores its potential implications. For instance, some studies highlight the adverse effects of rising populism on economic output (e.g., Born et al., 2019, Funke et al., 2020, Absher et al., 2020), whereas other studies explore its impact on social norms and hate crimes (e.g., Burzstyn et al., 2020, Müller and Schwarz, 2020). This study highlights the outmigration of skilled citizens as a possible consequence of rising political populism.====Increasing outmigration constitutes a potential channel to explain the adverse effects of populist leaders on the institutions and on the long-term economic prospects of their countries. There is a well-established relationship between the quality of institutions and economic growth (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2001, Rodrik et al., 2004). Some studies in the literature find evidence also for the relationship between migration and the quality of institutions. For instance, Powel et al. (2017) show that the influx of immigrants to Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union increased the quality of economic institutions in Israel. In particular, this study highlights the participation of immigrants into the political system by establishing new political parties as the main channel through which migration affects institutions. Similarly, Nowrasteh et al. (2020) find the positive effects of migration on institutions in Jordan after the First Gulf War. They claim that the economic boom generated by the influx of Kuwaiti-Palestinian migrants made the passage of economic reforms possible by the new government consisting of a record number of Palestinian ministers. These findings suggest that people are key for establishing and sustaining sound institutions. The outmigration of youth as international students after the adoption of authoritarian policies by populist leaders might adversely affect the quality of institutions in their origin countries. These adverse implications might be more acute if most of these international students stay abroad after graduation and do not actively participate in the political process of their origin countries. The eventual lack of skilled citizens in the origin countries might cause lower economic performance in the long-term.====This study also contributes to the literature on determinants of international migration by highlighting the rise of political populism in origin countries as a potential push factor.==== In a related strand of the literature, some studies explore the effect of political and civil liberties in origin countries and do not find evidence for outmigration.==== Unlike the earlier studies, this paper analyzes the effect of populism, which has caused an immediate deterioration of civil liberties but not necessarily of political rights in the countries analyzed.==== Moreover, populism might affect other determinants of migration, such as economic conditions in origin countries. Populism therefore might change migration behavior for a variety of reasons, and this paper consequently estimates the overall impact of the adoption of authoritarian populist policies on international mobility. Analyzing such a relationship in the context of student migration is preferred because it is less restricted by visa policies compared to alternative migration paths.====This study also makes a methodological contribution to the literature in terms of the manner in which it analyzes determinants of international migration. The earlier studies estimate a gravity equation and rely on variation in the value of explanatory variables across a wide spectrum of countries. For instance, the studies about the effect of political and civil liberties in the origin countries on international migration exploit the variation in these liberties that results from the overthrow of governments by means of coups and civil wars in the least democratic countries. In such cases, the current conditions of liberties are likely to be associated with past migration patterns, which raises concerns about the endogeneity. In contrast, this study analyzes student migration from relatively more democratic countries where elections were held and populist leaders gained power in closely contested elections. The analyzed events therefore can be considered as quasi-experiments, and the estimation of their impact can be achieved by comparing the migration patterns from the country that experienced the event to those from similar countries that did not. The SCM allows for a data-driven technique to find an appropriate comparison unit for that purpose.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 discusses trends in populism and international student migration; Section 3 explains the empirical methodology; Section 4 describes data; Section 5 presents results and discussions; and Section 6 constitutes the conclusion.",Youth responses to political populism: Education abroad as a step toward emigration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596723000021,3 February 2023,2023,Research Article,19.0

We find no evidence that text message reminders, either in the form of a general reminder or information about the saving goals of peers, encourage saving. Further, both types of messages discourage saving for participants who set a goal, particularly among high goal setters. We posit that informational nudges unintentionally increase the salience of unrealistic goals and engender boomerang effects that discourage high goal setters from saving. Among participants who received no messages, those who set goals save more, suggesting a tradeoff between commitment devices and informational nudges in this context.","Promoting savings behavior is a key concern among policy makers and commercial institutions alike. On a macro level, savings stimulates economic growth (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996, Black and Strahan, 2002, Levine, 2005) and reduces income inequality (Beck et al., 2007). On a micro level, savings is critical for poverty alleviation, risk smoothing, and economic welfare more generally (Burgess and Pande, 2005, Honohan, 2004, Allen et al., 2016).====Yet, across the world, many people under-save. Interventions aiming to incentivize saving behavior often rely on nudges, like messaging, and commitment devices, such as goal setting, to encourage savings. Evaluations of these interventions, however, show mixed results.==== Recent experiments in low-income settings have shown a positive impact of messaging and goals on saving, where messaging takes different forms, from general reminders about one’s goal to peer information (Karlan et al., 2016, Kast et al., 2018, Rodriguez and Saavedra, 2019). In high-income settings the results are more mixed and suggest that nudges may sometimes discourage saving (Beshears et al., 2015, Grinstein-Weiss et al., 2017, Raue et al., 2020, Dur et al., 2021). Nudges can be powerful interventions, but occasionally they may fail to achieve their objectives, and in some cases even backfire. Understanding the potential heterogeneity of these effects, and in particular, how nudges interact with other incentives, is thus key to the successful design of interventions aiming to promote saving (Beshears and Kosowsky, 2020).====We design a randomized intervention to elucidate how informational nudges, including general reminders and peer information, interact with goal setting to impact saving behavior. General reminders are thought to increase saving by addressing limited attention and promoting salience.==== While there are several theoretical reasons why peer information should also encourage saving, from belief updating to social benchmarking,==== in some settings peer information has been shown to discourage saving (Beshears et al., 2015). Moreover, while goal setting theoretically helps to overcome self-control problems, and is a standard feature in most interventions aiming to promote saving, goal setting can sometimes interact with nudges in discouraging ways. For example, if peer information leads to a “boomerang effect” (Clee and Wicklund, 1980), such as oppositional reactions or negative belief updating, messaging may reduce saving among people whose goals are inconsistent with their peers.==== General reminders may also unintentionally decrease saving among those who set unrealistic goals by increasing the salience of said goals.====Our randomized intervention specifically tests whether distinct types of messaging – general reminders versus peer information – have a differential impact on saving, and further, whether these messages interact with goal setting in heterogeneous ways. We implement our experiment among a random sample of 500 farmers in Romania, which is classified by the World Bank as an upper-middle income country, with a per capita GDP of $12,400 USD in 2018 at the time of our experiment. Saving in Romania is among the lowest in Europe and Central Asia, where just 14 percent of adults save in a formal account. We focus explicitly on farmers, as they represent almost a quarter of the labor force and a significant portion of the unbanked in Romania, suggesting that the potential gains from promoting saving are large among this group.====At the beginning of the experiment, each participant was presented with an offer to save in a home deposit box and informed that after three months, the research team would revisit to observe the total accumulated savings and pay interest on the balance. At baseline, all participants were asked whether they would like to set a saving goal and if so, how much they wished to save over the following months. In addition, participants were randomized into one of three groups. In the first group, participants received a general text message reminder to save approximately half-way through the study period. In a second group, participants received the general reminder and were also informed of the average saving goals of their peers. In a third, control group, participants received no text messages.====We find that on average, 17 percent of participants saved in the experimental home deposit box, accumulating 488 Lei ($122 USD) over the three-month period.==== We verify that engagement with the experimental home deposit box is unrelated to the participant’s (mis)trust in strangers or to possible hoarding behavior prior to follow-up. Moreover, we find no evidence of substitution into other formal savings accounts during the experimental period. Thus, relative to low baseline financial engagement, in which 27 percent of participants reported owning a formal savings account with an average balance of 700 Lei ($175 USD), and 20 percent saved in cash at home, engagement with the experimental home deposit box is qualitatively meaningful.====We then estimate the impact of messaging on saving behavior, conditional on having access to a saving device. First, we examine the effect of receiving any message – reminder or peer – on the propensity to save and find no significant difference between treatment and control. We then estimate the separate effect of reminders versus peer information and find that while both types of messaging appear to reduce the propensity to save, the difference is neither statistically significantly different from the control group nor between the two treatment groups.====Next, we examine heterogeneity by whether the participant set a saving goal. While the option to set a goal was given to all participants, the decision to set a goal was elicited prior to random treatment assignment, allowing for causal inference of the heterogeneous treatment effect. In addition, the proportion of those setting a goal (30 percent of the sample) is statistically equivalent across treatment and control, and is balanced across a host of observable baseline characteristics. In the control group with no messaging, goal setting is associated with a 15 percentage point increase in the likelihood of saving in the home deposit box and a 125 percent increase in the amount saved. However, in the treatment group, any messaging – reminder or peer – reduced the propensity to save for goal setters by 21 percentage points. When we disaggregate the treatment into reminder versus peer, we find that both types of messaging reduce the propensity to save for goal setters equally, but that peer reminders appear to reduce the total amount saved. Tests for selection on observables (Oster, 2019) suggest that the results are not driven by potentially confounding unobservable factors. Further, when we examine the effect of messaging on those who did not set a goal, we find that while the coefficients are positive, they are qualitatively small and statistically insignificant, suggesting that on its own, messaging is unlikely to impact saving.====We then attempt to elucidate why messaging negatively interacts with goal setting in our sample by comparing those who set high goals (i.e., above the mean saving goal of their peers) with those who set low or no goals. Here we find that for people who set high goals, messaging reduces the propensity to save by 23 percentage points. Furthermore, general reminders and peer information have a statistically equivalent impact on reducing the propensity to save among high goal setters, though peer messaging appears to reduce the total amount saved.====We posit that messaging negatively interacts with high goal setting for two reasons. First, for the group that received peer information, high-goal setters appear to update their beliefs downward, closer to that of their peers, exhibiting behavior that is consistent with a boomerang effect (Clee and Wicklund, 1980), such as negative belief updating (Schultz et al., 2007). Second, for the group that received general reminders, we argue that the reminder to save increased the salience of unrealistic saving goals among high goal setters. Hsiaw (2013) shows theoretically how unrealistic goals can discourage agents from exercising self-control, while Harding and Hsiaw (2014) show in the context of energy conservation that unrealistic goal setters were less able to conserve energy consumption. Our findings are consistent with this phenomenon, suggesting that increasing the salience of unrealistic goals can also disincentivize financial savings.====Our findings relate to several literatures. First, we contribute to the work on messaging and financial behavior.==== Specifically in regard to savings, Karlan et al. (2016) test the impact of messages that highlight saving goals versus financial incentives and find that both types increase saving. Messages that are framed in terms of a new beginning have also been shown to increase retirement savings (Beshears et al., 2021). Messages that include peer information, however, are not always effective. While several studies have documented peer effects in financial decision-making,==== recent field experiments on peer messaging show that information about peer behavior (Raue et al., 2020) and peer pressure (Kast et al., 2018) may increase saving in some settings and discourage saving in others (Beshears et al., 2015). Furthermore, even when messaging promotes saving, it remains unclear whether peer messaging is more effective than general reminders to save.====Our experimental design teases out the relative importance of general reminders versus peer information and finds that, at least in our setting, there is no differential impact between the two approaches on the propensity to save on average, but that both types of messages negatively interact with goal setting to discourage saving. Our study is one of the first to examine this heterogeneity, suggesting an important trade-off between goal setting and informational nudges in upper-middle income settings. This finding relates directly to the literature on goal setting, where a rich theoretical literature establishes the role of goals in managing self-control problems,==== and in particular, how unrealistic goals can lead to sub-optimal choices (Hsiaw, 2013). Our findings are consistent with empirical work on goal setting and energy conservation, which shows that consumers who choose realistic goals to reduce energy consumption save substantially more (Harding and Hsiaw, 2014).====We further contribute to the consumer psychology literature on boomerang effects (Clee and Wicklund, 1980, Ringold, 2002), where the provision of information about the behavior of one’s peers can lead to unintended consequences in the treatment group. Our results relate most closely to boomerang effects observed by Beshears et al. (2015), who find that providing peer information reduces 401(k) participation in the US. The specific boomerang effect documented there is an oppositional reaction, in which participants shift their behavior away from their peers upon realizing that their peers were saving more. In our setting, the observed boomerang effect is more consistent with negative belief updating, in which participants shift their behavior downward, toward their peers, upon learning that their own behavior is less common than previously believed.====Finally, most of the research on savings interventions comes from high income countries, like the US, or low-income settings in Africa, Southeast Asia, or Latin America. We know far less about the nuances of interventions in upper-middle income countries, such as Romania. Yet, some of the largest potential gains from promoting savings stand to be made in these places, where saving behavior is low, but incomes are relatively high.

Using the differential effects of FDI deregulation in 2002 in China on different ====, we find that FDI affects industrial agglomeration ====. As FDI brings technological ==== and various agglomeration benefits, other forces must be at work to drive this empirical finding. We propose a simple theory that FDI may discourage industrial agglomeration due to fiercer competition pressure. We find various evidence of this competition mechanism. We also find that FDI deregulation is conducive to industrial growth, but the dispersion induced by FDI deregulation reduces the positive effect of FDI on the growth rate by 8 to 14%.","This paper is concerned with two ====. The first is the agglomeration of economic activities (Jacobs 1969, Lucas Jr. 1988, Krugman 1991, Glaeser et al. 1992). More specifically, industrialization and urbanization are two salient phenomena that are closely intertwined in the development process for developing countries (Henderson 2005 and Michaels et al. 2014). The second mechanism is technology diffusion (Howitt 2000 and Acemoglu et al. 2006), which is fundamentally what underlies the convergence hypothesis. In developing countries, special economic zones are often established as a means to promote economic growth, and the rationales are mainly these two mechanisms: to promote the clustering of firms/industries and to facilitate technology diffusion by attracting foreign direct investment (henceforth FDI). Manifesting these ideas is the emergence of Shenzhen from a small fishing village to one of the four top-tier cities in China and Iskandar Malaysia, which achieved significant economic growth after its establishment in 2006.====Despite the importance of these two mechanisms, there are few studies on their interaction. This paper aims to fill this void by studying whether and how FDI may affect industrial agglomeration and by probing their implications on industrial growth. Specifically, we explore a particular historical event to empirically examine the effect of FDI on industrial agglomeration. China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) near the end of 2001. As a condition of accession, China was required to relax its controls on FDI entry: the extent of deregulation differed across industries. Specifically, China encouraged FDI entries in around one quarter of its manufacturing industries, with the rest remaining mostly status quo. Our main data set is the Annual Surveys of Industrial Firms (ASIF) during 1998–2007, and the data shows that such differential deregulation of FDI generated different degrees of the influx of foreign capital and firms across industries.====These variations in FDI deregulation across industries and time allow us to use a difference-in-differences (DD) estimation approach. Specifically, we compare the degrees of industrial agglomeration in the FDI-deregulated industries with those in the status-quo industries before and after the deregulation, which occurred in 2002, not long after the WTO accession. The degree of industrial agglomeration is measured using a widely-used index, the Ellison–Glaeser (EG) index (Ellison and Glaeser, 1997). The identifying assumption in estimating the causal effect of FDI deregulation is whether the deregulated industries and the timing of the deregulation are randomly determined or not. Before the DD estimation, we examine the spatial distribution of manufacturing output. We find that the FDI-deregulated industries as a whole were concentrated in the coastal region (relative to the inland region) during the entire data period, but the degree of concentration reduced substantially after the WTO accession. In contrast, there was little change in the degrees of concentration for the status-quo industries after the WTO accession.====The first task of our DD estimation is a check on the parallel pre-trends between the treatment and control groups; it is shown that there is no difference in industrial agglomeration between the treatment and the control group before the FDI deregulations. Second, we control for the nonrandom selection of deregulated industries by carefully examining the determinants of FDI deregulations. Third, we control for other concurrent policy reforms that may affect industrial agglomeration. These policy reforms include tariff reductions, restructuring and privatization of SOEs, special economic zones, and the Western Development Program. Another important concurrent shock was the elimination of trade policy uncertainty due to the US’ granting of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to China which occurred around the same time as China’s WTO accession; this is also controlled. Conditional on a set of controls, the relaxation of FDI regulations is plausibly exogenous. We find a significantly negative effect of FDI deregulation on industrial agglomeration, and this result is robust to a battery of robustness checks. The results are in line with the above-mentioned descriptive pattern that the spatial distribution of manufacturing output for the FDI-deregulated industries became more even after the WTO accession.====Firms tend to cluster for various agglomeration benefits.==== Foreign firms (and hence FDI) also tend to cluster (Alfaro and Chen, 2014). Thus, locations with numerous foreign firms may be attractive for domestic firms due to technology diffusion and other agglomeration benefits such as input–output linkages among foreign and domestic firms. Zooming in to technology diffusion in particular, various studies (e.g., Keller and Yeaple 2009 ; Haskel et al. 2007; Keller 2002) have demonstrated the positive effects of inward FDI on the productivity of domestic firms. Nevertheless, our empirical results suggest that other forces must be at work and dominate the above-mentioned agglomeration benefits/forces (at least on average across industries) so that a negative impact of FDI on agglomeration is observed. Our next task is to investigate possible mechanisms that could explain our empirical finding.====Our main hypothesis is that ====. The influx of FDI firms and capital and the fact that they are more productive implies that Chinese domestic firms face fiercer competition pressure, which forms a dispersion force. To illustrate this, we develop a simple theory based on the interaction between technology diffusion as an agglomeration force and competition as a dispersion force. If domestic firms are located in the same region as the foreign firms, they may receive technological spillover and thus have higher productivities on average than the domestic firms that stay in the other region with fewer or no foreign firms.==== But the existence of transport costs between regions makes regions with more firms more competitive, reducing markups, sales, and profits for the firms there and discouraging firms from locating there.====Our theory implies a hump shape in the relation of industrial agglomeration with foreign capital or with industry size. When there is little foreign capital and the overall industry size is small, increasing foreign capital (and hence the number of foreign firms) promotes agglomeration because of the strong effect of technology diffusion and the weak effect of competition as the industry size is small. This is reminiscent of the Shenzhen/Iskandar story. However, when foreign capital keeps increasing while the domestic capital is kept fixed, the degree of agglomeration eventually starts to decrease because the productivity gap narrows due to accrued technology diffusion and because the increases in foreign capital also increase the overall industry size, rendering stronger competition pressure. Alternative comparative statics show that the hump-shaped pattern remains robust when both types of capital increase such that the overall industry size increases. Around 2002 and compared with the years right after the Reform and Opening up in 1979, there were already plenty of foreign firms in China, and the productivity gap between domestic and foreign firms narrowed. Moreover, the industry sizes (inclusive of both domestic and foreign firms) were also much larger to render fiercer competition pressure. Thus, it is likely that many industries in China around 2002 are on the decreasing part of the hump shape, thus driving our empirical finding.====To test the theoretical mechanism, we estimate the effect of FDI deregulation on markups, sales, and profits of firms. We do find that after 2002 the markups, sales, and profits of firms in the deregulated industries are significantly lower than their counterparts in the status-quo industries. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence for the technology-diffusion channel as a higher share of foreign firms in a region is associated with a smaller technology gap between foreign and domestic firms in that region. As our baseline result reflects a cross-industry average effect of FDI deregulation on industrial agglomeration, we also test the hump-shape prediction by examining the heterogeneous effect of FDI deregulation according to industry size and according to the presence of foreign firms. The data supports the hump-shape prediction.====Our final empirical investigation is on the impact of FDI and agglomeration on industrial growth. We find that FDI deregulation increases the industrial growth rate, but the dispersion induced by FDI deregulation reduces the positive effect of FDI on the growth rate by ==== to 14%. This finding is consistent with our proposed mechanism and previous empirical findings. Compared with bare-bone FDI-promoting policies, our findings suggest that these policies coupled with agglomeration-promoting policies such as special economic zones would be more effective because FDI influx may cause dispersion and thereby dampen growth potential.====Our literature review starts with a closely related work by Lu et al. (2017), who empirically study the effect of FDI on firm productivities and highlight both the positive and negative roles of FDI. The identification strategy in this paper is also similar to theirs. Nevertheless, there are three important differences between the current study and theirs. First, we investigate the implications of FDI on the economic geography of industries in China, which may render important policy implications such as those on FDI-promoting place-based policies. Second, we propose a theory of FDI on the economic geography and predict a hump shape for the effect of FDI deregulation on industrial agglomeration. Our empirical test on the mechanism further affirms the hump-shape theoretical result. Third, we investigate the effect of FDI on industrial growth and the role of industrial agglomeration in this effect.====Next, we discuss other related empirical literature on the effects of FDI on domestic firms. Using Venezuela data, Aitken and Harrison (1999) find empirical evidence that domestic firms may benefit from foreign firms through channels such as knowledge spillover, input sharing, and labor pooling, but they may lose market share to the more productive foreign multinationals. Their findings generally corroborate our above-mentioned mechanism tests. Alfaro and Chen (2018) decompose the aggregate industry productivity into a within-firm productivity effect and a between-firm selection and reallocation effect, and find that the selection and reallocation effect account for two-thirds of the effect of multinationals on aggregate industry productivity. Using data from Mexico, Venezuela, and the US, Aitken et al. (1996) study the effect of FDI on local wages. Aitken et al. (1997) use Mexican plant-level data to study the effect of FDI on exports by domestic firms. Using data from the Czech Republic, Kosová (2010) studies the effect of FDI on firm selection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to identify the effect of FDI on industrial agglomeration in a country.====Our work is also related to the literature on (industrial) agglomeration, which, in the past few decades, has substantially advanced our understanding of various agglomeration forces operating at the industry level or across industries. These include knowledge spillover, labor pooling, input–output linkages, and many others. See Marshall (1920) for initial ideas on agglomeration, and recent micro-level fine-grained evidence on input–output linkages through the lens of matching. For modern development of related literature, see Duranton and Puga (2004) for a survey on the theoretical literature, and Rosenthal and Strange (2004) on the empirical counterpart.==== Less emphasized is the role of international trade and foreign direct investment. A few recent studies point to the positive role of international trade on the agglomeration of economic activities within a country (see, e.g., Rauch 1991; Fajgelbaum and Redding 2022 ; Tombe and Zhu 2019; Redding 2016), but little work has been done on the role of FDI, which is the focus of our work.====Note that our work focuses specifically on industrial agglomeration as opposed to agglomeration in general. The canonical theories of agglomeration typically model situations when two sides of the markets (buyers and sellers) are both mobile; e.g., when firms and people cluster together to form large regions or cities. See, for examples, Krugman (1991), Helpman (1998), Ottaviano et al. (2002), and Murata (2003). However, our focus here, as fits our regression specification and results, is on the location pattern of firms in an industry. Thus, our theory uses the partial-equilibrium framework of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) and allows only the firms to be mobile. After all, the location pattern of each of the 424 four-digit industries is unlikely to affect the location pattern of the population or the overall economy.==== The implication of this partial-equilibrium approach is that the competition effect discourages agglomeration of firms rather than encourages it, as seen in models where both firms and consumers are mobile, e.g., Ottaviano et al. (2002). To the best of our knowledge, our empirical results provide the first evidence of pro-competitive effects being a dispersion force for industrial agglomeration.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the data and the background of the FDI deregulation in 2002. Section 3 specifies the estimation strategy. Section 4 presents the empirical results of the effect of FDI on agglomeration. Section 5 examines two potential explanations and conducts mechanism tests. Section 6 investigates the effect of FDI and industrial agglomeration on industrial growth rate.

We contacted the mayor's office in over 6,000 cities asking for information about starting a new business. Chinese and German cities responded to 36–37 percent of requests while American cities responded only to 22 percent of requests. American and German cities were more responsive to requests from citizens than foreigners; Chinese cities were more responsive to requests from men than women. Chinese cities were more responsive to requests about starting a construction than a green business, and when the mayor was up for ====. These results shed light on bureaucratic responsiveness in autocracies and democracies and for top-down versus bottom-up policy making.","Government performance is often viewed as the product of decisions made by political leaders, who formulate policies and are ultimately accountable for outcomes. Yet the effectiveness of government also depends on how policies are implemented at the operational level by unelected government workers who form the primary point of contact between citizens and their governments. The critical role of street-level workers was cast in a harsh light during China's lockdown of Shanghai during the COVID pandemic, where so-called “Big Whites” – the lowest level of government workers, named for the hazmat suits they wear – were on the front lines distributing food supplies, conducting tests, and enforcing lockdowns, and became the target of citizen frustration when things went wrong.==== The challenge of motivating and monitoring street-level bureaucrats is relatively unexplored in the study of government effectiveness under both democracy and autocracy.==== In this paper, we provide both descriptive facts and large-scale experimental evidence on the provision of operational-level services by street-level bureaucrats in more than 6000 cities in China, Germany, and the United States based on identical field experiments conducted in each country in 2017–2018. We find that local workers in each country exercise substantial discretion in ways that bias and reduce government effectiveness.====The specific service we study is provision of information about city rules and regulations: we contacted the mayor's office in each city, requesting information on the procedures for starting a new business. The outcome of interest is whether a city responded to our request or not. We chose to assess this particular service because it is a universal function of local governments, simple to provide, and easy to measure. Almost all citizens need to navigate the bureaucracy of their governments from time to time. Our choice to focus on information about starting a new business was motivated by the fact that countries require completion of numerous procedures in order to open a business, such as registering, acquiring a tax ID, and so forth (Djankov et al., 2002). Helping the public get through this thicket is important for new business formation and economic performance.====Formally, street-level bureaucrats are charged to carry out policies established by higher-level political officials, but in practice they may have significant discretion in how – or even whether – they implement policies. Street-level agents may not share or even be fully aware of the goals of political leaders, and the tools available to motivate government workers are limited due to flat wages and civil service protections that make removal difficult. Consequently, street-level bureaucrats may substitute their own goals, prioritize service to those they deem most worthy, or simply not provide the service. A key question is how well top leaders are able to manage the agency problems within their organizations: to what extent do bureaucrats follow top-down policies versus their own “bottom-up” preferences (Besley and Ghatak 2005; Lipsky 2010; Finan et al., 2017)?====The amount of discretion depends on incentives embedded in the political hierarchy. In an autocracy like China, political leaders have strong incentives to create top-down pressure on bureaucrats whose actions can directly affect the performance measures that determine the leaders’ career advancement, and office workers sometimes receive bonuses based on achievement of policy goals, such as attracting foreign investment. The cost of such incentive schemes is potentially inefficient substitution into measured activities and out of unmeasured activities. In a democracy, adherence to policy directives depends to a large degree on bureaucrats’ intrinsic motivation, and they may use discretion to advance their personal policy preferences or biases instead of political leaders’ career concerns. It is unclear a priori which political system produces more effective bureaucratic performance. One reason we run our experiments across three countries is to begin creating an evidence base on the differences and similarities in bureaucratic practices under different forms of government.====For roughly 2000 cities in each country, we identified the most common electronic method to contact the mayor's office.==== We sent each office a letter in the country's native language indicating a desire to form a new business in the city, and requesting help identifying the requisite procedures, with a fictitious signatory and return email address. These surveys establish some comparative stylized facts: overall, Chinese cities responded to 36 percent of requests, compared to 37 percent in Germany and 22 percent in the United States. Street-level responsiveness was materially higher in China and Germany than the United States. Although Chinese officials do not have to face voters, they appear to have incentive to respond to public inquiries. At the same time, in all three countries nearly two-thirds of requests for help were ignored, indicating that street-level bureaucrats exercised considerable discretion in deciding whether to respond.====To formally test for the use of discretion, we varied the experimental treatment in terms of the gender and nationality of the person sending the letter. These characteristics may matter to street-level workers if they are biased against certain groups – but discriminating on those grounds is not a top-down directive. In terms of gender, we find that Chinese cities were 6 percent less likely to respond to an inquiry from a woman than a man; German cities showed no significant difference in responses by gender; and American cities were 4 percent ==== likely to respond to a woman than a man. In terms of nationality, we find that American cities were 16 percent and German cities 11 percent more likely to respond to an inquiry from a citizen than a foreigner, while Chinese cities were equally likely to respond to requests from citizens and foreigners. These causal effects align with social biases documented in each country by the World Values Survey. Since all three countries have high-level policies against discrimination on gender, and to some extent nationality, the existence of these types of discrimination appears to be an exercise in bureaucratic discretion.====We conducted additional tests tailored to detect the presence of top-down pressures specifically in China. In nondemocratic governments, a politician's career advancement depends on gaining approval from higher-level leaders that control the promotion process (Xu, 2011), and theory suggests that autocrats will emphasize economic growth in order to maximize the resources they can extract (Olson 1993).==== If street-level bureaucrats in an autocracy are influenced by top leaders, theory then suggests they would prioritize of economic growth. To test this proposition, we varied the nature of the business mentioned in the letter between a conventional industrial product (construction materials) and an environmentally friendly product (recycling). Chinese cities were 9 percent more likely to respond to a letter mentioning the industrial business than the green business. In American and Germany cities, which function here as a benchmark, bureaucrats did not significantly differentiate between these requests. The Chinese evidence is consistent with the idea of top-down pressure for economic growth, which squares with autocratic theory and conventional descriptions of Chinese politics.====To further assess the importance of top-down pressures in China, we conducted another experiment calibrated to features of the Chinese promotion process. We conjecture that mayors are more likely to care about responsiveness when they are being considered for promotion. To test this, we randomized the date of our inquiry, either before or after the quinquennial Chinese National People's Congress, which occurs around the time that mayors for the next five years are selected at provincial and prefectural congresses. We find modest support for this channel: mayoral offices were 4 percent more likely to respond to an inquiry before than after the National Congress. Interestingly, the response rate to green proposals (environmentally friendly projects) rose 5 percent prior to the National Congress, while support for dirty proposals (industrial businesses) was statistically unchanged. In light of rhetoric by top Chinese leaders on the importance of environmental protection, this finding suggests that, at the critical moment of promotion, local politicians may pressure bureaucrats to advance goals articulated by top leaders.====Our study is related to research on the quality and responsiveness of government across regimes.==== The COVID pandemic rekindled debate over the effectiveness of autocratic versus democratic governments. In the early stages of the pandemic, authoritarians touted the quick and (apparently) effective responses of China and other one-party states, but subsequent lengthy and harsh lockdowns under China's zero-COVID policy have revealed a less-flattering side of the story. Most research on government quality relies on publicly available data, surveys of experts, or self-surveys of government workers.==== Our study follows in the path of (Chong et al., 2014) which uses a field experiment to assess the quality of postal services in 159 countries. We introduce a new metric – street-level responsiveness – which suggests that the governments of Chinese cities are about as responsive as the governments of German cities, and more responsive than American cities.====Our study is also related to an emerging literature on the importance of low-level bureaucrats for state effectiveness, which focuses on how incentives and bureaucratic discretion affect government performance (Finan et al., 2017). While this literature has studied the effects of granting discretion in specific countries, the basic question of how bureaucratic discretion and its use varies across countries is unexplored. Perhaps our central finding is that street-level bureaucrats in these three countries appear to have exercised significant discretion, but used it in different ways.====Finally, our study is also close in spirit to correspondence studies involving local governments. Chen et al. (2016) and Distelhorst and Hou (2017) studied China, and Jensen et al. (2020) and White et al. (2015) studied American cities. Our study follows these others in assessing responsiveness, but it differs in its treatments, in requesting information about starting a new business, and its scope is broader in covering three countries. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first audit study of bureaucrats that asks identical questions across multiple countries.","Street-level responsiveness of city governments in China, Germany, and the United States",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759672300001X,14 January 2023,2023,Research Article,22.0

Our identification strategy leverages variation in workers’ exposure to the new minimum wage, and exploits the fact that there has been no increase in the minimum wage in previous years, to account for heterogeneous labor market prospects of low-wage workers relative to high-wage workers. Using detailed administrative records to track workers before and after the policy change, we show that the minimum wage hike significantly increased the earnings of low-wage workers. This direct effect was amplified by wage ==== reaching the median of the pre-policy income distribution. Overall, we find no negative effects on the employment prospects of low-wage workers. However, we provide suggestive evidence that young workers, highly exposed municipalities, and tradable sectors may be more negatively affected. In contrast, labor market concentration or the presence of envelope wages appear to be associated with lower job losses. Taken together, our findings imply an employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage of −0.021, and an own-wage elasticity of −0.033, suggesting that wage gains dominated employment losses.","Minimum wage is the flagship policy to increase wages at the bottom of the income distribution. In the U.S., a total of 74 cities, counties, and states raised their minimum wages in 2021 (Lathrop, 2020). In the European Union, minimum wage legislation is also gaining momentum with several member states raising national minimum wages (Aumayr-Pintar et al., 2020), and the Council recently agreeing on a mandate to implement a European framework for adequate minimum wages (Council of the European Union, 2021). Despite being widely used, however, minimum wage policy is not without controversy, as the evidence on the overall effect of minimum wages on low-wage workers remains mixed (Neumark and Shirley, 2022, Manning, 2021).====In this paper, we analyze the labor market prospects of low-wage workers following a significant increase in the minimum wage in Lithuania. On the 19th of December of 2012, the government announced an increase in the minimum wage from 317 to 373 euros, effective on the 1st of January of 2013. This 17.7% hike represents the largest relative increase in Lithuania’s history and has several features that make it an interesting case for investigating the effect of the minimum wage on the labor market. First, the hike is among the largest single-step minimum wage increases analyzed in the literature. Second, it was a permanent increase that profoundly altered the earnings distribution, as around 25% of wage earners had monthly incomes of less than 373 euros at the end of 2012. Third, it was enacted only 5 months after an earlier, relatively smaller raise, that followed 4 years of no change. Fourth, this historically large increase was adopted in a context of favorable conditions, namely sustained economic and price growth, as well as being the result of an agreement between the social partners.====To evaluate the impact of such increase, we use detailed monthly Social Security records covering a quarter of the Lithuanian population to track the labor market outcomes of workers, i.e., income and employment, before and after the legislative change. Our identification strategy relies on two unique features of our setting. We exploit the high-frequency nature of our data and leverage variation in workers’ exposure to the new minimum wage just prior to its increase. Therefore, we precisely locate workers along the income distribution, from the most to the least exposed to the policy change, thereby being able to identify both the direct and indirect effects of the minimum wage.====As emphasized by Ashenfelter and Card (1982), labor market outcomes of low-wage workers differ from those of workers higher up in the income distribution both in terms of employment retention probabilities and potential income growth, regardless of any change in the minimum wage. To account for these differences, we adopt a strategy similar to that of Dustmann et al. (2022). We take advantage of the period in which we observe no change in the level of the minimum wage to contrast labor market outcomes over such period to those after the minimum wage increase, and use the upper tail of the income distribution to account for economy-wide effects. In this framework, we identify the causal effect of the minimum wage increase on worker-level outcomes under the assumption that macroeconomic changes and heterogeneous labor market prospects of workers located at different points in the income distribution are properly accounted for. Thus, in the absence of the minimum wage increase, labor market outcomes would have evolved in the same way for workers exposed differently to the minimum wage.====Our results indicate that workers directly affected by the new minimum wage, i.e., those whose income was below 373 euros in December 2012, experienced an average increase in income equal to 11.5% after a year, compared to individuals located in the upper tail of the income distribution. We also document that the impact of the minimum wage extends beyond directly affected workers. Spillover effects are substantial for workers near the new minimum wage and diminish, but are still present, up to about the median of the pre-policy income distribution. Both direct and indirect effects are strongest just after the minimum wage increase, and weaken somewhat a year later. We perform a detailed heterogeneity analysis and find that the positive wage effects are particularly salient among groups who exhibit lower average income, i.e., women, young workers, and non-tradable industries. Interestingly, wage effects are almost equal to the size of the actual minimum wage hike among firms that pay envelope wages, suggesting that tax-evading firms may be reacting to the minimum wage by legalizing undeclared wages (Tonin, 2011, Bíró et al., 2022).====As for employment effects, we find that the minimum wage increase had no discernible effect on the employment prospects of Lithuanian workers, with the sole exception of workers in the lowest income category, which includes mostly part-time workers, who were negatively affected. Notably, this negative effect is not immediate, and only appears one year after the increase in the minimum wage. In our heterogeneity analysis, we provide suggestive evidence about the existence of possible disemployment effects among young workers, in highly exposed municipalities, and the tradable sector. We also find suggestive evidence that raising the minimum wage may produce fewer employment losses in more concentrated industries, consistent with monopsony theory (Manning, 2013), as well as among companies engaging in payroll tax evasion, in line with the declaration of underreported wages as an absorption mechanism (Gavoille and Zasova, 2021).====To support the causal interpretation of our findings, we show that the impact of the minimum wage only occurs after the increase was enacted. In addition, we compare our minimum wage increase of interest to a milder, earlier hike and show that the larger the increase, the larger the effect identified. Finally, we perform a falsification test on the upper tail of the income distribution and show that the labor market outcomes of high-wage workers did not react to the minimum wage increase. Therefore, the impact of the minimum wage only appears among workers at the bottom of the income distribution, the individuals affected by the policy.====Lastly, we compute the employment elasticities implied by our point estimates. Our calculations yield an employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage of −0.021 (s.e. 0.034) and an own-wage employment elasticity equal to −0.033 (s.e. 0.053). Both implied elasticities are consistent with the minimum wage hike increasing the earnings of low-wage workers without harming their employment prospects (e.g., Dube, 2019). Consequently, the minimum wage policy contributed to reducing wage inequality.====Our work complements different strands of the minimum wage literature. First, an extensive empirical literature investigating how minimum wage policy affects wages and employment (Card and Krueger, 1995, Neumark and Wascher, 2010, Manning, 2021) has focused on changes in employment levels among teens (e.g., Neumark et al., 2014, Allegretto et al., 2017) or in specific sectors (e.g., Dube et al., 2010), and more recently on overall employment (Meer and West, 2016, Cengiz et al., 2019, Giupponi et al., 2022). Instead, we examine the worker-level effects of a large and persistent minimum wage increase, which is key for understanding the ability of minimum wage policy to improve the situation of low-wage workers. Our individual approach is closely related to that of Currie and Fallick, 1996, Clemens and Wither, 2019, Dustmann et al., 2022 and Gopalan et al. (2021), or Choi et al. (2021) who investigate the effect of the minimum wage on workers’ income and employment trajectories. We contribute to this line of work by looking at a country not previously analyzed in the literature, Lithuania, and a nationwide minimum wage hike that is among the largest, one-time, increases investigated in the literature and was enacted under very favorable conditions. Importantly, we account for the peculiarities of the labor market prospects of low-wage workers using a pre-policy period, but we investigate an increase in the minimum wage, not the first time such legislation has been introduce as in Dustmann et al. (2022), and we also provide evidence on short and medium-term effects.====Second, we add to the literature on spillover and distributional effects of minimum wage legislation (recent research on this topic includes Autor et al., 2016, Rinz and Voorheis, 2018, Ferraro et al., 2018b, Cengiz et al., 2019, Gopalan et al., 2021, Engbom and Moser, 2021, Choi et al., 2021, Dustmann et al., 2022, Gregory and Zierahn, 2022, Giupponi et al., 2022). The central point in this literature is the existence (and magnitude) of spillover effects after a minimum wage increase. While much of this research identifies the spillover effects from changes in the income distribution following an increase in the minimum wage, we quantify their magnitude by tracking the wages of workers located at different points in the income distribution over different time horizons and compare them to the evolution of wages in a pre-policy period. Our findings are consistent with existing evidence of sizable spillover effects that decline steadily up to, at most, the median of the pre-policy income distribution (e.g., Cengiz et al., 2019). However, by looking at different time horizons, our analysis suggests that the time dimension somehow matters for the magnitude of spillovers. Our empirical strategy also allows us to examine the existence of possible spillover effects for workers at the upper tail of the income distribution. Recently, Gregory and Zierahn (2022) has examined the introduction of a minimum wage with an extraordinary bite during an economic downturn. The authors find positive spillover effects (on both wages and employment) for workers slightly above the new minimum wage, but, surprisingly, negative effects for workers further up in the income distribution. In contrast, our results point to no effects for the latter group of workers, highlighting that economic conditions interact in a non-negligible way with the labor market effects of minimum wage changes (Clemens and Wither, 2019).====Third, several papers have been published in the last two decades, using very different methods and data sources, investigating the labor market effects of minimum wages in Central and Eastern European countries such as Czech Republic (Grossmann, 2021), Estonia (Ferraro et al., 2018a), Hungary (Harasztosi and Lindner, 2019), Latvia (Gavoille and Zasova, 2021), North Macedonia (Jovanovic et al., 2021), Poland (Albinowski and Lewandowski, 2022), Slovakia (Eriksson and Pytlikova, 2004), and Slovenia (Vodopivec, 2015). Evidence from this set of studies is still mixed. We contribute to this literature not only because of Lithuania’s inclusion in the list of countries, but also for other reasons. First, the 17.7% minimum wage hike that we investigate is in the upper-tail of the distribution of hikes previously analyzed, which has a median minimum wage change of 10.3%. Second, our identification strategy directly accounts for differences in workers’ labor market prospects that are unrelated to changes in the minimum wage, something that has been overlooked in all papers analyzing the worker-level effects of minimum wage changes in the region (Ferraro et al., 2018b, Eriksson and Pytlikova, 2004, Vodopivec, 2015), with the sole exception of Grossmann (2021). Finally, our comprehensive administrative data allows us to analyze the impact on different groups of workers, firms, or market structures and, hence, to better understand the labor market effects of changes in the minimum wage. Therefore, the sharp and persistent increase in the minimum wage, combined with the quality of our high-frequency administrative data and the existence of a long pre-policy period, allows us to causally identify the labor market effects of a minimum wages and explore its heterogeneous effects.====Our results are in line with the studies that find no or limited negative effects on employment, but some groups are more affected than others (e.g., youth). Moreover, our exhaustive heterogeneity analysis highlights the importance of zooming in on specific labor markets, as the effect of the minimum wage may vary depending on firms’ ability to pass on labor costs in prices or on their market power. Similarly, suggestive evidence on envelope wages as a potential mechanism partially behind muted employment effects following a minimum wage increase, in line with recent evidence from Latvia (Gavoille and Zasova, 2021), emphasizes the value of taking into account interactions between payroll tax evasion and minimum wage legislation (Tonin, 2011, Bíró et al., 2022).====Finally, our analysis also contributes to the policy debate on whether minimum wage policy can be an effective tool to address the high levels of income inequality that characterize many of Central and Eastern European economies (Heyns, 2005, Bandelj and Mahutga, 2010, Brien et al., 2019), compared to other European countries (Bubbico and Freytag, 2018). In this regard, our paper offers a possible explanation for the decline in wage inequality observed in these countries between 2002 and 2014, which was driven by a faster increase in wages at the bottom of the income distribution (Magda et al., 2021).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Potential preference shifts with respect to other types of state involvement in the economy, however, have gone unexplored. We draw on both longitudinal and pseudo-panel data from Russia to explore how labor market hardships relate to preferences for public sector employment and employers. In fixed effects specifications, we demonstrate that recent feelings of job insecurity, experiences with wage arrears, and spells of unemployment all increase the attractiveness of work in the public sector. Pseudo-panel data provide evidence that labor market hardships, particularly when experienced at times of economic crisis and social upheaval, can shape preferences over the longer run.","How do labor market hardships affect individuals’ preferences as to the size and scope of government? Recognizing the limitations of cross-sectional analyses, a small but growing literature draws on longitudinal surveys to explore the extent to which experiencing such hardships leads to increased support for public social safety net programs (Margalit, 2013, 2019; Owens and Pedulla, 2014; Marten, 2019; O'Grady, 2019; Wiertz and Rodon, 2019). Whether similar effects surface with respect to other governmental roles, however, remains an open question. Here, we exploit both longitudinal and pseudo-panel data from Russia to investigate how labor market hardships change individual preferences with respect to public sector employment and employers. We present evidence that support for the public sector increases with worsening labor market circumstances in manners consistent with both immediate self-interest and longer-term learning.====In the 1980s and 1990s, a consensus took hold among global policy elites that a robust private sector, in conjunction with a government of limited size and scope, was a necessary condition for growth and development (Williamson, 1993; Kikeri and Nellis, 2004). Despite the ensuing efforts to privatize state enterprises and downsize public bureaucracies, most notably in the former communist bloc, we observe today not only that governments remain important providers of jobs (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2020) but that non-elites remain distinctly ambivalent about the private sector (Stanisevski and French, 2020).==== The latter, perhaps, should not surprise us. Public sector enterprises, agencies and organizations are relatively shielded from market pressures, allowing them to act as both a channel of redistribution and source of employment security during economic downturns. (Shleifer and Vishny, 1994; Shleifer, 1998; Rodrik, 2000; Dewenter and Malatesta, 2001; Alesina et al., 2000, 2001).==== To offer but one noteworthy piece of evidence, a recent survey conducted across fourteen countries found that employees of private sector firms were significantly more likely to have been negatively affected by the COVID-induced global economic crisis than employees of state enterprises or other public sector entities (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2020).==== In the post-communist world, in particular, the view that the public sector serves as a stabilizer, offering workers greater security, particularly in times of macro-economic stress, is not difficult to understand. Under the old regime, after all, employment guarantees at state-owned firms were ironclad (Kornai, 1992).====Inspired by what others have demonstrated with respect to the relationship between labor market hardships and support for government welfare and redistribution programs, we hypothesize that individual-specific economic shocks increase support for public sector employment and employers. Below, both the longitudinal and pseudo-panel data suggest that unemployment does increase the relative attractiveness of the public sector in this regard. Moreover, among the currently employed, public sector preferences similarly shift with feelings of job insecurity and experiences with wage arrears.====To our knowledge, all prior studies of the determinants of support for both public sector employment and employers, draw on cross-sectional surveys, with researchers highlighting static connections between preferences and individuals’ employment status, work motivations, education level, health, ideological leanings, and risk aversion, among other variables (Lewis and Frank, 2002; Norris, 2003; Kaltenthaler et al., 2006; Buelens and Broeck, 2007; Battaglio and Legge, 2009; Bonnet et al., 2012; Denisova et al., 2012; Van de Walle et al., 2015; Rosenfeld, 2020). Cross-sectional data, of course, even if rich in covariates, are limited in their ability to support causal claims; relatedly, they cannot shed light on the dynamic relationship between time varying individual circumstances and individual policy preferences. Here, we draw on longitudinal and pseudo-panel data to address these limitations. Although our fixed effects specifications do not eliminate all potential sources of bias (notably, unobserved, time-varying individual factors), by controlling for unobserved, time-invariant individual differences, they do get us closer than the existing literature to identifying the roots of attitudes toward public sector employment and employers.====Our analysis ties into several literatures of note. Recent years have witnessed both an uptick in interest in and new opportunities to study the political implications of economic shocks. One strand of this literature focuses on voting outcomes from exposure to macro-level shocks, such as from financial crises or sudden spikes in imports (Colantone and Stanig, 2018; Autor et al., 2020). A second strand, to which our article contributes more directly, highlights the relationship between personal exposure to shocks and individual preferences and voting behavior (Ahlquist et al., 2020).====A second literature concerns the underpinnings of political preferences, particularly as they relate to the size and scope of government. Some seminal work in this area highlights the importance of narrowly-construed self-interest (Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Iversen and Soskice, 2001), whereas some emphasizes the role of deep-seated ideological dispositions (Campbell et al., 1960). A third strand offers a hybrid perspective, focusing on how learning, potentially through life experience, can alter understandings of either how one's self-interest is best served or how the world can and should operate (Gerber and Green, 1999; Page and Shapiro, 1992). Inspired by this work, and in a manner we spell out more fully below, social scientists have recently begun to exploit the greater availability of longitudinal surveys to connect labor market hardships to support for government welfare programs so as to better distinguish among the competing perspectives on the roots of political preferences (Margalit, 2013, 2019; Owens and Pedulla, 2014; Marten, 2019; O'Grady, 2019; Wiertz and Rodon, 2019).====A not unrelated literature explores individuals’ desire to work in the public as opposed to the private sector. In addition to assessing the potential contribution of a “public service motivation,” a great deal of research highlights the role of self-interested, extrinsic incentives, including greater job security.==== Asking “who wants to work for the government?”, Lewis and Frank (2002) use U.S. General Social Survey data to demonstrate that a positive response can be explained by the desire for greater job security. Norris (2003) and Van de Walle et al. (2015) confirm the same with cross-country data from the International Social Survey Program. In a unique survey of Russian college students, Rosenfeld (2020) shows that those from families that became less well off after the collapse of commmunism, are much more likely to express a preference for government jobs, “perhaps because they ... seek the security of government employment.”====Our study here also ties into a multi-faceted literature on the political economy of post-communist reforms, generally, and privatization, specifically. A focus on the public's economic preferences hearkens back to a largely theoretical debate on the complementarity of economic and political liberalization. Przeworski (1991), for one, postulated that direct experience with reform-induced disruptions (e.g., layoffs from non-competitive firms) might shift popular support away from economic liberalization. Hellman (1998), however, expressed confidence that post-communist citizens, understanding the long-term benefits of liberalization, would tolerate short-term disruptions and persist in their preference for economic liberalization. A related and more empirically grounded literature assesses whether changing economic conditions drove post-communist electoral outcomes. Synthesizing findings from research on the first decade of post-communist reforms, Tucker (2002) describes a divergence between macro-level analyses that confirm the presence of “economic voting” and survey-based work that conclude that individuals’ voting choices, after accounting for other observables, are largely unrelated to their economic circumstances. Drawing on Russian survey data from the mid-1990s, however, Richter (2006) shows that personally experiencing wage arrears diminishes one's electoral support for the pro-liberalization incumbent, Boris Yeltsin. Survey respondents’ support for post-communist economic reforms, generally, has been shown to relate to deep historical factors (Grosfeld et al., 2013), years of exposure to communism (Pop-Eleches and Tucker, 2017), post-communist political liberalization (Grosjean and Senik, 2010), the design of post-communist privatization policies (Earle and Gehlbach, 2003), and business cycle effects (Grosjean et al., 2013; De Haas et al., 2016), among other factors. Support for post-communist privatization, specifically, has been linked to deep historical factors (Castan˜eda Dower and Markevich, 2014), post-communist governance institutions (Denisova et al., 2009) as well as a host of individual characteristics, including age, gender, education, and risk tolerance (Kaltenthaler et al., 2006).====Of the two most comprehensive, cross-country analyses of preferences over firm ownership type, one draws on the post-communist experience with privatization. Exploiting a 2006 survey of 28,000 individuals in 28 countries, Denisova et al. (2012) demonstrate that state ownership is preferred by those possessing less human capital and those reporting having suffered greater economic hardship during the transition from communism. Moreover, their research highlights that some opposition to privatization can be understood not as distaste for private ownership per se but rather as displeasure with perceived injustices in the manner privatization had been implemented. In a comparable study, pooling 130,000 respondents between 1998 and 2008 across 17 Latin American countries, Bonnet et al. (2012) explore the correlates of responses to a question that asked whether “privatizations have been beneficial to the country.” Showing that opposition to privatization prevails among public sector employees, the unemployed, and the asset poor, the authors conclude that preferences “respond to a mix of absolute and relative welfare effects. Specific categories that are likely to have suffered directly from privatizations . . . do indeed express more dissatisfaction.”====As noted above, all prior studies of preferences relating to the government as an employer and/or business owner rely exclusively on cross-sectional data. In what follows, we bring longitudinal survey data to bear, allowing us to control for individual-level, time-invariant unobservable characteristics so as to more cleanly identify factors that drive these preferences. In so doing, we aim to contribute to literatures on political preference formation, generally, and preferences over government employment and employers, specifically. Our analysis proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out our theory of the factors shaping individual preferences with respect to public sector employment and employers. Section 3 reviews Russia's experience with reforms in the 1990s. Section 4 describes the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey data that we draw on and lays out our empirical approach.

We examine the differential effects of foreign investor protection (FIP) and domestic investor protection (DIP) on cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As). To guide our empirical analysis, we first present a model in which, when faced with differentiated FIP and DIP, a firm chooses between investing domestically and investing in a foreign country via M&A. The model predicts that cross-border M&As are more likely to occur when in the target country FIP becomes stronger or DIP becomes weaker. The effects are more pronounced in contract-intensive ====. We then construct a data set of worldwide cross-border M&A deals over the period of 1988–2014 and empirically test the model predictions. Our empirical findings support the theoretical predictions. In addition, we find that the effects are stronger (a) for M&As with larger acquired shares, (b) in target countries farther away from the home countries, and (c) in target countries with better financial development.","The last three decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As), with the total value increasing from $187 billion to $1.46 trillion between 1988 and 2014.==== Given the prevalence of cross-border M&As, a nascent strand of literature investigates why firms stretch their boundaries to international market and where specifically they choose to expand. In general, cross-border M&As allow multinationals to exploit their comparative advantages, such as technology (Markusen, 2002). Another strand of literature emphasizes the importance of institutional quality in determining comparative advantages. For example, Nunn (2007) finds that better contract enforcement shifts a country's comparative advantage toward sectors that are more intensive in relationship-specific investments. In this study, we explore the link between the above two strands of literatures but focus on how a host country's institutional quality affects cross-border M&As.====Application of discriminatory clauses and biased enforcement happen now and then around the world. For example, some countries are inclined to discriminate against foreign investors, whereas others are not.==== Two types of institutions exist in general, one providing more protection to domestic investors and the other providing more protection to foreign investors. According to our database, some countries (e.g., Brunei and the Middle East) endeavor to attract FDI but have incompatible attitudes toward domestic investors, whereas some transitional economies (e.g., Ukraine and Belarus) do little to protect foreign multinationals but provide good business environments for domestic firms. For example, Saudi Arabia ranks 39th in foreign investor protection (FIP) but 126th in domestic investor protection (DIP). By contrast, Belarus ranks 11th in DIP but only 120th in FIP.====Although the literature largely ignores variations between these two types of institutions across countries, our paper aims to examine how the variations affect cross-border M&As differently. We first present a simple theoretical model to examine the differential effects of FIP and DIP on cross-border M&As. Our model is similar to that of Levchenko (2007) in that contract enforcement matters more for industries with high contract intensity. Levchenko (2007) shows that countries with better investor protection have comparative advantages in industries with high contract intensity. Different from Levchenko (2007), we examine two types of investor protection, namely, FIP and DIP. Our model predicts that multinationals are more (less) likely to conduct cross-border M&As when the target countries have better FIP (DIP), and the results are stronger for firms requiring substantial relationship-specific investments. The reason is that better FIP enhances the comparative advantage of the (foreign) acquiring firms and thus raises the M&A incentives, whereas better DIP declines the profit of the merged units and hence crowds out the cross-border M&As.====We then test our predictions on a large sample of 81,147 cross-border M&As involving 206 countries and 29 manufacturing industries over the period of 1988–2014. Specifically, we first regress the intensity of cross-border M&As on FIP and DIP at the country level, controlling for a host of country-level determinants of cross-border M&As and a set of fixed effects. We then regress the intensity of cross-border M&As on the interaction between FIP and contract intensity and that between DIP and contract intensity. We find that the estimate of FIP is significantly positive; the estimate of DIP is significantly negative; the interaction term between FIP and contract intensity is significantly positive; and the interaction term between DIP and contract intensity is significantly negative. These findings, consistent with the predictions of the model, indicate that firms, especially in contract-intensive industries, are more likely to be acquired by foreign firms when FIP is stronger. But this is less likely to be the case when DIP is stronger. The economic magnitudes of these effects are substantial. On average, a one-standard-deviation increase in FIP raises cross-border M&As by 32.52% in an industry with the average score of contract intensity, whereas a one-standard-deviation increase in DIP reduces cross-border M&As by 5.54%. In industries of high contract intensity (75th percentile score of contract intensity), a one-standard-deviation increase in FIP raises cross-border M&As by 45.11%, whereas a one-standard-deviation increase in DIP reduces cross-border M&As by 8%. Our results hold with the inclusion of more stringent acquirer-country-year fixed effect, target-country-year fixed effect, and industry-year fixed effect, thereby ruling out explanations based on time-variant differences across acquirer countries, target countries, and industries. Our results also persist when we consider the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum- Likelihood (PPML) model, alternative measures of acquisition intensity, the extent of domestic competition, a set of additional controls, and an alternative sample with only deals in which acquirers buy more than 50% of the target shares.====Our empirical strategy focuses on identifying the heterogeneous effects of investor protection on cross-border M&As in industries with different levels of contract intensity, so our analysis is not vulnerable to potential endogeneity bias (e.g., Rajan and Zingales, 1998). However, reverse causality may still be a concern, because countries hosting many cross-border M&As in contract-intensive industries may have a strong incentive to develop a good institutional environment for foreign investors and pay less attention to domestic investments. We address this concern by employing an instrumental variable (IV) regression approach. We adopt four instruments, that is, the ethnolinguistic fractionalization (ELF) index of year 1985 (Roeder, 2001), a dummy indicating more than one official languages, a dummy indicating more than one colonizer, and the average genetic distance. We obtain consistent results.====We also explore how our basic results perform under various environments. We find that the effects of FIP on promoting cross-border M&As and the effects of DIP on reducing cross-border M&As are more pronounced in each of the following cases: (a) when we focus on cross-border M&As with larger foreign shares, (b) when exporting is more costly, as proxied by the costs of international shipping,==== and (c) when the target countries’ financial markets are better developed.====Our work belongs to the growing literature on the economic role of institutions. The seminal paper by Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) emphasizes the respective importance of “property rights institutions” and “contracting institutions” for economic growth. Nunn (2007) and Levchenko (2007) show, theoretically and empirically, that the quality of contract enforcement shapes the patterns of international trade. Existing studies also show that various types of institutions, such as investor protection, intellectual property rights protection, corporate transparency, environmental protection, and anti-corruption, are crucial factors in determining FDI flows (Glass and Saggi, 2002; Kelley and Woldtke, 2006; Razin and Sadka, 2007; Dean et al., 2009; Lucke and Eichler, 2016). The present study contributes to this literature by investigating how institutionalized discrimination of foreign and domestic investors affects cross-border M&As. The distinguishing feature of our study is our attention to the differential effects of FIP and DIP in contract-intensive industries. Although Fan and Gao (2017) also disentangle two types of creditor rights protection, they focus on the differentiated impacts of FIP and DIP on external private debts in developing countries.====The findings of our study offer new insights into the literature documenting the determinants of cross-border M&A activity. Regarding country-level factors, researchers have studied the links between cross-border M&As and valuation (Erel et al., 2012), culture (Siegel et al., 2011; Ahern et al., 2015), regulation policies (Karolyi and Taboada, 2015), financing (di Giovanni, 2005), and institutions (Rossi and Volpin, 2004; Bris and Cabolis, 2008). Several studies analyze the effects of firm characteristics, such as institutional ownership, and director experience, on the probability and outcomes of cross-border M&As (Ferreira et al., 2010; Field and Mkrtchyan, 2017). Our study is about institutional quality at the country level and thus is more related to Rossi and Volpin (2004) and Bris and Cabolis (2008). Rossi and Volpin (2004) find that target countries with strong investor protection, proxied by accounting standards and shareholder protection, could attract more cross-border M&A inflows. Bris and Cabolis (2008) show that better investor protection in the acquirer's country is associated with a higher merger premium. We separately examine the discriminatory protections of foreign and domestic investors in the target countries. Our study also emphasizes the importance of contract intensity at the industry level, a topic that is related to recent studies on the role of industry features in cross-border M&As (e.g., Frésard et al., 2017).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple model to demonstrate the underlying mechanisms through which FIP and DIP affect cross-border M&As. Section 3 introduces our empirical strategy and data.

This paper investigates whether and how environmental regulation exacerbates the wage inequality between skilled and unskilled labor. Employing a triple difference-in-differences (DDD) estimation method on Chinese urban household survey data, we find a 1.7% increase in the wage gap after the implementation of a regional-specific environmental regulation. We show that the enlarged wage gap is mainly due to the intensive margin’s change and is dominated by the polluting sector rather than the non-polluting one. More importantly, the unappealing effect on wage inequality lasts in the long run and is not China-specific, according to our numerical simulation of a ==== model. Finally, we also propose a non-environmental policy instrument to alleviate the negative impact. Overall, our work highlights that environmental regulation may have an unintended wage inequality cost, and our study is of generic policy implications to other economies.","Environmental regulations are associated with benefits and costs. On the bright side, a stringent environmental policy could improve environmental quality and household life expectancy (Greenstone and Hanna, 2014, Tanaka, 2015). On the dark side, environmentally regulated firms would experience a recession, manifested as output reduction (Wang et al., 2018) and labor demand shrinkage (Kahn and Mansur, 2013, Liu et al., 2021). Yet, little is known about how different kinds of labor (====, skilled and unskilled labor), especially their wage gap (inequality), respond to environmental regulations.====This paper attempts to fill this gap by studying the impact of an environmental policy on wage inequality between skilled and unskilled labor. Our study is of practical implications for policymakers, as the government strives for environmental and economic inequality issues when setting policy agendas. Previous studies have investigated environmental regulations’ effect on income and health inequality (====, Constant, 2019, Jha et al., 2019), while little attention has been paid to the causal relationship between environmental policy and skilled–unskilled wage inequality.==== In this paper, we first establish the empirical relationship with short-run micro evidence in the context of China, and then generalize our findings to a long-run perspective and other countries with a general equilibrium framework.====As one of the largest developing countries, China once experienced environmental deterioration for rapid production expansion but now makes great efforts in curbing environmental pollution. In 2005, the Chinese central government first put forward a province-varying reduction target on provincial sulfur dioxide (SO====) emissions in the eleventh Five-Year Plan (====, from 2006 to 2010). This policy effectively reduced pollution and has been used in studies about firms’ responses (====, labor demand and export decisions) to environmental regulation (====, Liu et al., 2017, Shi and Xu, 2018).====In line with these works, we treat the provincial SO==== reduction target policy as an exogenous shock, and employ a triple difference-in-differences (DDD) method to compare the wage gap between skilled and unskilled labor in highly and non-highly regulated regions before and after the policy shock. Our data are from the Chinese Urban Household Survey (UHS), a nationally representative dataset, which is used in many related studies (Han et al., 2012, Dai et al., 2021). Our DDD estimation finds that a one percentage point increase in the SO==== reduction target would lead to an approximate 1.7% expansion in wage inequality. The result is persistent during the sample period (====, from 2002 to 2009, with the shock period from 2006 to 2009).====To understand the economic mechanism of this enlarged wage inequality, we first investigate the dynamic pattern of the wage gap between the skilled and unskilled ==== (====, employed labor), and find the wage inequality still rises. Then, we look at the layoff propensity of the skilled and unskilled labor, and find no significant difference from the unemployment probability gap between the highly and non-highly regulated regions. Thus, our baseline result is mainly driven by the intensive margin (====, change the relative wage of the skilled and unskilled workers) rather than the extensive margin (====, relative high layoff probability). This result aligns with and complements the empirical findings in Berman and Bui (2001) and Liu et al. (2017), which examine the firm’s ==== employment change in the wake of an environmental policy. In addition, we perform a subsample DDD analysis and show that the widened wage gap is from the polluting instead of the green sector.====Our empirical results are robust to the following specifications: (i) We perform a placebo test and show that the results are not led by the unobserved time-varying characteristics between the skilled and unskilled people. (ii) We take an instrumental variable (IV) approach to deal with the endogenous environmental regulation intensity. Concretely, we follow Hering and Poncet (2014) and Shi and Xu (2018) and use the provincial ventilation coefficient as the IV for policy intensity. Our IV results suggest an even more considerable increase in the wage gap. (iii) We exclude 2008 and 2009 to rule out the 2008 global financial crisis concurrent event, since the financial tsunami might also affect polluting firms’ employment structure. (iv) We test the individual migration decision and find no evidence that unskilled labor tends to migrate to lower regulated regions after the policy implementation. That means the household’s endogenous migration decision does not affect our findings. (v) We conduct a weighted regression analysis to show that the previous conclusions are robust to a weighting scheme incorporating the different number of interviewees in different provinces.====Based on the micro-level evidence, some further questions would be: whether the enlarged wage inequality caused by environmental regulations would last in the long run; or is specific to China; and moreover, how to deal with the unappealing rise in the wage gap. To answer these counterfactual questions, we construct a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model. The model economy features differentiated skilled and unskilled labor, and differentiated firms in polluting and green sectors. The environmental regulation is modeled as the punitive penalties on firms’ pollutant emissions, and its intensity is calibrated by matching the average provincial SO==== reduction target outlined in the eleventh Five-Year Plan.====Our 40-year simulated transition path to this permanent exogenous regulatory shock also shows an increase in wage inequality after implementing the environmental policy. The transmission mechanism is consistent with our empirical findings that the polluting sector is more affected by the regulation. Both the skilled and unskilled workers who are squeezed out of the polluting firms seek opportunities in the green sector. Since the green sector is more skill-intensive than the polluting one, unskilled workers are relatively over-supplied in the green sector compared with the skilled ones, which explains the enlarged wage gap. The long-run effect and mechanism are qualitatively general, since the simulation results preserve when we relax model parameters to standard (non-China-specific) values in the literature (====, Acemoglu et al., 2012, Angelopoulos et al., 2017).====To deal with the undesired wage inequality induced by the current environmental regulation, we also propose a non-environmental policy for regulators. The counterfactual experiment shows that boosting human capital investment plays a positive and effective role in preventing enlarged wage inequality, with the emission reduction target still fulfilled. This result implies that non-environmental policy aiming at reducing education gap together with environmental regulation could achieve both the environmental and equality goals.",Dark side of environmental regulation: Wage inequality cost,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000865,13 December 2022,2022,Research Article,27.0

While much attention is given to education as a valid instrument to reduce alcohol misuse, less is given to the impact of non-cognitive skills. Data are collected from a nationally representative Russian panel survey, 2016–2018. We estimate a random-effects ","There is a growing body of literature studying the importance of non-cognitive skills, also referred to as personality traits====, in predicting social outcomes (Heckman et al., 2006). As a vital component of human capital, non-cognitive skills are found to affect educational attainment (Humburg, 2017), unemployment (Cuesta and Budria, 2017), wages (Brunello and Schlotter, 2011; Gensowski, 2018), mobility (Ayhan et al., 2020), and health-related outcomes, including longevity (Savelyev, 2020; Savelyev and Tan, 2019). Alcohol consumption is another essential part of social behavior, which may have harmful effect on one's well-being in case of excessive drinking. Although the relationship between personality and drinking patterns has been extensively studied in psychology, research in other social sciences, such as economics and sociology, has generally explained alcohol consumption with social factors and has claimed the existence of a negative correlation between alcohol abuse and education (Droomers et al., 1999; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010; Conti and Hansman, 2013). However, to understand, why some individuals are involved in heavy drinking, while others abstain, a more complex approach, combining both social and psychological perspectives, should be used.====Excessive alcohol consumption implies high costs both for an individual and the society in terms of health and economy. Russia is a particularly interesting context to study. First, Russia is known for high levels of alcohol consumption and northern drinking patterns which is characterized by the prevalence of strong spirits, and a high burden of alcohol-related mortality (Nemtsov et al., 2011). Although Russia has been moving away from previous drinking levels (Radaev and Roshchina, 2019; Radaev et al., 2020;), risky episodic drinking remains a widespread problem (WHO, 2019). To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to document the relationship between non-cognitive skills and alcohol consumption in the Russian context.====There are several mechanisms linking alcohol consumption to non-cognitive skills. First, problem-drinking among parents has negative effects on children, including lower educational attainment and the development of drinking problems (Mangiavacchi and Piccoli, 2018). Since non-cognitive skills are closely linked to genetics and the social environment during the early stages of childhood, they can serve as a mediator for the process of inheriting alcohol addiction. Second, different non-cognitive skills are reportedly related to different drinking motives (Theakston et al., 2004). Finally, non-cognitive skills may influence educational attainment, while education is viewed as an important factor against excessive alcohol consumption (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010; Conti and Hansman, 2013).====To address non-cognitive skills, the existing research generally relies on the Big Five model, which is an effective framework for identifying and structuring personality attributes. The model consists of openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (John and Srivastava, 1999). Openness to experience is defined as curiosity and open-mindedness. Conscientiousness is associated with dutifulness, self-discipline, diligence, and other productive facets. Extraversion reflects sociability and assertiveness. Agreeableness refers to one's ability to avoid conflicts, cooperate, and help others. Finally, neuroticism is a tendency towards emotional instability, anxiety, and self‐consciousness. The psychology literature reports vast evidence that the Big Five correlates with alcohol-related behavior. Since conscientiousness implies following social norms and demonstrating effective self-control, being high in conscientiousness is often negatively correlated with different types of risky and unhealthy behaviors, such as avoiding physical activity, following an unhealthy diet, or having various addictions (Meyer et al., 2001; Bogg and Roberts, 2004). The overall protective effect of conscientiousness on health is three times higher than that of other social and economic factors (Roberts et al., 2007). In contrast to conscientiousness, extraversion increases the chances of developing alcohol-related problems (Erevik et al., 2017) as drinking is often perceived as an element of social interaction (Flory et al., 2002; Wicki et al., 2010). Finally, neuroticism is frequently related to different types of psychopathologies, including depression and anxiety. It is also associated with alcohol misuse (Hampson and Friedman, 2008; Adan et al., 2017). The evidence on the relation between alcohol consumption and the rest of the Big Five categories remains disputed.====In this paper, by adopting the Five Factor model, we explore the effect of non-cognitive skills on the probability and the volume of alcohol consumption in Russia by combining the existing psychological evidence with other socially important factors. Data are collected from a nationally representative panel survey, 2016–2018. We estimate a random-effects probit model for the probability of abstinence and a random-effects tobit model with a Heckman correction for the volume of alcohol consumption. We find that conscientiousness and extraversion have strong connections to the probability and the volume of alcohol consumption in both genders. On average, a one standard deviation increase in conscientiousness is associated with an increase in the probability of abstinence of 2 percentage points, while a one standard deviation increase in extraversion reduces this probability by 2.3 percentage points for men and 4.1 percentage points for women. Conscientiousness, extraversion, openness to experience, and neuroticism also affect the volume of consumed alcohol. Moreover, we point out that the estimates for education differ substantially when the Big Five variables are excluded from the model, which suggests that a major part of the effect of education on alcohol consumption may be mediated through non-cognitive skills. Since the negative consequences of alcohol consumption might differ between personality types, providing insight into the relation between alcohol consumption, education, and non-cognitive skills can be useful for correcting the focus of alcohol-related policy. We further check the stability of our results, as well as possible reversed causality in a large battery of robustness checks. The results are robust to alternative models and samples.====The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, much of the empirical literature dedicated to the link between non-cognitive skills and alcohol consumption is based on small samples without sufficient controls for other socioeconomic characteristics and lacks any discussion of causality. In contrast, this paper is based on data collected from an annual nationally representative panel survey which allows us to explore the problem of reversed causality. Second, this paper adds to the limited literature in the field of health economics which studies the relationship between non-cognitive skills and health-related behaviors. Lastly, it is based on data from a country with a longstanding problem of excessive alcohol consumption.",Do non-cognitive skills matter for alcohol consumption?

We test this by studying how culture mediates the impact of drought on the gender education gap in two separate settings: Malawi and Indonesia. In so doing, we proxy culture with kinship traditions (matrilocality and patrilocality) and exploit drought episodes’ spatial and temporal randomness as a source of exogenous variation in rural households’ exposure to adverse income shocks. After accounting for grid and year-fixed effects, we find that patrilocal households, but not matrilocal ones, sacrifice their daughters’ schooling in favor of sons’ when they experience droughts and schooling requires payment of fees. These results survive numerous robustness checks and are driven by disparities in women’s empowerment and the extent of son preference between matrilocal and patrilocal groups.","Gender disparities disadvantaging girls in primary and secondary education have disappeared in the developed world,==== but persist in developing countries.==== As most developing countries are prone to adverse income shocks, such as drought, pandemics, and floods, the resulting income volatility may impose difficult choices on cash-constrained low-income households. This paper provides evidence on whether culture interrelates with adverse income shocks to explain the gender education gap favoring boys in developing countries.====We focus on the gender education gap for two important reasons. First, girls’ education enhances the quality of the labor force, the fertility transition, and maternal health (Bloom et al., 2009), which makes it a lever of economic development (Wodon et al., 2018). However, despite this, girls continue to trail boys in educational attainment globally. Only 49% of countries have achieved gender parity in primary education, 42% in lower secondary education, and a mere 24% in upper secondary education. Moreover, in the developing world, the difference in boys’ and girls’ enrollment rates – an indicator of the gender education gap – remains significant.==== To the extent that girls’ education is a lever of development, as the literature finds, the persistence of this gender gap in developing countries is a serious threat to the timely completion of the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs).====Second, the literature examining the causes of the persistence of gender disparities in educational attainment in low-income countries points to the lack of development itself as the main culprit (Alderman et al., 1996, Klasing and Milionis, 2020). For example, poor maternal health – the result of inadequate health infrastructure – may induce households to invest less in girls’ education relative to boys because girls are not expected to live past their childbearing years (Jayachandran, 2015). Moreover, the cost of a girl’s education relative to a boy of the same age tends to rise with age, resulting in school environments that are inhospitable to adolescent girls (Goldin and Katz, 2000, Kazianga et al., 2013, Birungi et al., 2015). What is more, adolescent girls may not have access to contraceptives or other means of birth control (Goldin and Katz, 2000), implying that unintended pregnancies may end their education prematurely compared to boys. These three facts suggest that external factors, such as differential (opportunity) costs of education based on gender (Goldin and Katz, 2000, Kazianga et al., 2013, Birungi et al., 2015) and differential life expectancy at birth (Jayachandran, 2015) can open up a gender education gap, without gender discrimination (Björkman-Nyqvist, 2013). However, while these facts explain why developed countries have eliminated the gender education gap but not less developed ones, they do not necessarily account for disparities in the size of this gap among the latter countries themselves.====Yet, accounting for such disparities is important if the driving forces of this undesirable phenomenon are to become well-understood.====To analyze the interrelation between adverse income shocks and culture, we draw from Bau (2021) by using customs of post-marriage residence for couples as proxies for culture: matrilocality and patrilocality. These marriage customs prescribe whether daughters (matrilocality) or sons (patrilocality) co-reside with their parents after marriage, eventually becoming their source of old-age support (Bau, 2021). However, they also differ in two other respects. First, patrilocality prohibits women from inheriting the wealth of their parents (Berge et al., 2014), whereas women can inherit their parents’ wealth in matrilocal communities (Peters, 2010). Second, in matrilocal groups, children are public goods only to their mother’s kin who have a vested interest in their well-being (Lowes, 2020). We hypothesize that these differences between the two customs affect how low-income parents allocate their scarce resources across offspring based on gender.====Moreover, we follow the literature by exploiting the spatial and temporal randomness of drought episodes, which are well-documented adverse income shocks (Jayachandran, 2006, Björkman-Nyqvist, 2013, Corno et al., 2020). In so doing, we draw from Harari and Ferrara (2018), Miao and Popp (2014), and Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010a) by measuring drought based on the Standardized Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The SPEI combines the effects of precipitation, potential evaporation, and temperature. Indeed, unlike drought measures based on precipitation alone, the SPEI accounts for how the soil retains water. This multiscalar drought index allows us to account for a possible spatial correlation from omitted weather variables. We focus on the rainy season because it coincides with the start of the cropping season. Therefore, by drought, we mean drought occurring in the rainy (or agricultural) season, making it an adverse income shock in rural communities dependent on rainfed agriculture for livelihoods.====Additionally, we use representative individual panel data from rural Malawi and rural Indonesia, respectively. The common denominator between these two countries is the co-existence in their territories of two different customs of post-marriage residence for couples: matrilocality and patrilocality. In addition, both have been the sites of extreme weather shocks, including droughts and floods, and are heavily reliant on agriculture (Menon et al., 2007, Pauw et al., 2010, Syaukat et al., 2011). However, despite these similarities, the two countries have disparities encompassing the economic and social spheres. First, Malawi is a landlocked low-income country ranked among the 11th poorest worldwide ====. By contrast, Indonesia is an upper-middle-income South-East Asian country accessible by sea, with a GDP per capita six times the level of Malawi. Second, the two countries differ in the number of years of compulsory schooling in the education sector. Whereas in Malawi, primary education is free but not compulsory, and school fees are imposed for enrollment in secondary education, in Indonesia, as of 1994, compulsory education covers nine grades, which is primary education plus three years of secondary education. Estimating the interrelation of adverse aggregate income shocks and culture in these two different socioeconomic contexts thus also provides a test of the external validity of our findings.====Finally, we estimate a linear fixed-effects probability model in which a child’s school dropout probability each year, conditional on being enrolled the year before, is the outcome of interest. Thus, we proxy the gender education gap with the gender gap in school dropout — defined as the gap between a girl’s dropout probability and that of a boy of the same age. The higher this gap, the bigger the gender education gap favoring boys. We account for grid-cell and year-fixed effects. We follow Manning and Swaffield, 2008, Tembon and Fort, 2008, Blau and Kahn, 2017, Björkman-Nyqvist, 2013 and Reichelt et al. (2021) in specifying this linear fixed-effects model for each gender. This split-sample regression approach reflects the more realistic assumption that boys and girls have different attitudes towards schooling. For example, girls are often reported to have different psychological attributes than boys (Heckman and Kautz, 2012), while relative to girls, boys may be keener to conform to patriarchal gender norms because such norms empower them at the expense of girls (Van Hoorn and Maseland, 2010, Bisin et al., 2016, van Hoorn, 2016). Both these cases would violate the assumption of homoscedastic residual errors underlying the pooled-sample approach based on interacting terms.====Our primary analysis samples comprise children aged ==== for Malawi and ==== for Indonesia, respectively. When schooling is not free of charge, estimation results show that drought increases the gender education gap in patrilocal communities but not in matrilocal ones. Indeed, results show that a mediating effect of culture exists only for schoolchildren aged ==== in Malawi and ==== In Indonesia. These are children whose schooling requires payments of fees by households. By contrast, such a mediating effect does not exist for younger schoolchildren — those aged ==== in Malawi and ==== in (relatively more affluent) Indonesia. These are children whose education is free of charge according their respective school systems.====To increase confidence in the validity of these findings, we demonstrate that they pass various robustness checks in both empirical settings, depending on the availability of relevant data. First, we show that in Malawi and Indonesia, our main results are robust to controlling for potential correlates of kinship traditions and household fixed effects. These results also hold when we account for spatial correlation and replace our baseline split-sample analysis with a pooled-sample approach using interacting terms. Second, in Malawi, our results also hold when replacing prevailing customs of post-marriage residence for couples with prevailing lineage systems as proxies for culture.====Finally, exploring the mechanisms underlying this interrelation between drought and prevailing customs of post-marriage residence for couples, we consider son preference and measures of women’s empowerment. Indeed, if women in patrilocal marriages traditionally lack decision-making authority, they are unlikely to take action or make choices to support their parents’ well-being in old age. Anticipating this, low-income parents in patrilocal communities may prefer having sons instead of daughters. This idea is consistent with evidence showing that gender inequality favoring boys later in life starts early through parents’ preference for having and investing in sons (Edlund, 1999, Choi and Hwang, 2015, Lambert and Rossi, 2016, Jayachandran, 2015, Jayachandran and Pande, 2017). In Malawi – the only one of the two settings for which relevant data is available –, we find that, relative to women in matrilocal marriages, women in patrilocal marriages want more sons than daughters and have less decision-making power in their families. These findings support the hypothesis that son preference is integral to mechanisms through which patrilocality combines with economic hardship to drive up the gender education gap in developing countries.====There are three takeaways from our study. First, when exposed to adverse income shocks, low-income households in developing countries lean on culture to give them rules for selecting the gender of offspring whose outcomes – in this case, schooling – they will sacrifice to enhance survival. Second, culture may explain why gender education gaps vary across low-income countries. This finding is important because it indicates that economic growth is insufficient to eliminate these countries’ gaps. Third, public policies that induce cultural change are integral to public efforts to enhance development outcomes, such as gender parity in educational attainment. These facts are consistent with evidence showing that Western democracies did not eliminate their gender education gaps until they adopted policies to induce cultural change. An example is the adoption of equal opportunity policies that persuaded parents to invest equally in sons’ and daughters’ education (Beveridge et al., 2000, Cheung and Chan, 2007, De Paola et al., 2010).====This paper contributes to the broad literature on gender inequality in education. Contributions to this literature point to poor economic conditions either at the aggregate level (Alderman et al., 1996, Alderman and Gertler, 1997) or at the household level (Björkman-Nyqvist, 2013) as the primary driver of gender inequality in education. Alderman et al. (1996) find evidence in rural Pakistan that local school shortages account for about a third to two-fifths of the gender gap in schooling outcomes. Björkman-Nyqvist (2013) uses random variation in rainfall across districts in Uganda to identify the causal effect of poor household economic conditions on the gender gap favoring boys in primary education attainment and achievements. The common denominator of this literature is that this positive effect of financial hardship is obtained in settings that are home to predominantly patrilocal cultures. Indeed, both Pakistan (Khan, 1998, Taj et al., 2004) and Uganda (Obbo, 1989, Katabarwa et al., 2000) are the settings of strictly patrilineal systems of kinship in which the practice of patrilocality to assign post-marriage living arrangements to couples is near universal. We contribute to this literature by showing that removing barriers to the supply of education, and improving the school environment for girls, although desirable from a public policy perspective, may not eliminate the gender education gap. Instead, countries prone to covariate income shocks should combine such policies with those that induce cultural change to achieve this goal.====This paper also contributes to the broader literature on adverse aggregate income shocks and individual outcomes (Jayachandran, 2006, Burke et al., 2015, Dinkelman, 2017, Corno et al., 2020, Kaur, 2019). Both (Dinkelman, 2017) and Corno et al. (2020) study the effects of drought on youth outcomes. Dinkelman (2017) studies the long-term effect of drought on children’s human capital. In contrast, Corno et al. (2020) focus on its effect on girls’ child marriage probabilities conditional on the marriage custom (bride price vs. dowry). We complement this literature by analyzing the effects of drought on the probabilities of school dropout of children living in rural Malawi and rural Indonesia, conditional on gender and culture.====Finally, we contribute to the nascent literature in economics building on anthropologists’ recognition of the impact of traditional systems of kinship on economic outcomes in developing countries (Jayachandran, 2015, La Ferrara and Milazzo, 2017, Lowes, 2020, Bau, 2021). For example, Bau (2021) finds that culture directly affects the gender education gap because of parents’ concern for their old-age security. We differ from Bau (2021) in that we test whether adverse aggregate income shocks interrelate with culture to drive this gap in low-income countries.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

We find that becoming a mother has negative impacts on women's labor outcomes. But the impacts appear to recover sooner than what has been found in other countries. A decomposition exercise suggests that parenthood plays a limited role in explaining the large gender inequality in China's labor market. We document a form of intergenerational arrangement that is prevalent among Chinese families: Upon the arrival of a child, grandmothers substantially reduce market labor supply and provide much of the childcare. Grandparents’ help with childcare likely plays an important role in alleviating the motherhood effect. Suggestive evidence indicates that in return, ==== who help with childcare receive more intra-family transfers and report higher subjective wellbeing. We further show that the motherhood effect, though relatively small, has increased substantially over the past decades. The rising gender gap in the labor market, the declining state sector that historically provides more flexible accommodations for working mothers, and the abolishment of the one-child policy all suggest a rising burden of motherhood on labor market outcomes.","Across the world, women's labor outcomes are negatively and persistently impacted by the arrival of the first child, while men's are barely scathed (Kleven et al., 2019a, 2019b). After decades of progress in gender equality, this “child penalty” on women relative to men has become the major contributor to the remaining gender gap in western industrialized countries (Cortes and Pan, 2020).====Compared with other countries, China presents an interesting case: It has a high gender inequality that has risen rapidly in the past few decades. Between 2010 and 2018, the residual gender earnings gap is 40.0%.==== In the same period, China has one of the highest female employment rates in the world (Panel A of Fig. 1). Compared with selected developed, developing, and transitional economies, China has an exceptionally high female employment rate for those between the mid-20 s and 30 s, the age range in which women are most likely to be childbearing or having small children. Indeed, the employment rate of Chinese women with small children is high and increases quickly as the child ages (Panel B of Fig. 1). For instance, only 65% of the American women with a three-year-old work in the labor market, while three-quarters of their Chinese counterparts do. The high employment rate of women with small children seems to suggest a less pronounced motherhood effect in China.====This paper estimates the causal effects of the birth of the first child on parents’ labor market outcomes in China using a new household longitudinal study. Adopting an event study approach (Kleven et al., 2019b), we find that the motherhood effect is initially large for Chinese women. Relative to the pre-pregnancy period, the share of women in the labor force declines by 40 percentage points (p.p.) in the year of childbirth. Afterward, however, women's labor supply recovers quickly. When the child reaches age five, women's labor force participation and work hours are not considerably below the levels implied by pre-pregnancy trends. Similar to their labor supply responses, women's earnings decline sharply after the childbirth but recover quickly. These labor market effects are comparable to those found in Nordic countries such as Denmark but much smaller than other industrialized countries such as the United States and Germany (Kleven et al., 2019a) or other East Asian countries such as South Korea (Park, 2021). Consistent with findings in other countries, Chinese men experience no significant changes in their labor market outcomes after the birth of the first child. According to a simple decomposition exercise, the child penalty can explain up to one-third of China's gender earnings gap, a much smaller share than what has been found in developed countries.====We explore possible explanations for the modest child penalty in China vis-à-vis substantial gender disparity, prevalent gender discrimination in the labor market,==== and limited market options for childcare.==== One popular intra-family arrangement stands out: Conventionally, Chinese grandparents are heavily involved in childcare. The help is prevalent: About 35% of new mothers in our sample report receiving grandparents-provided childcare in the first year a child is born. The percentage remains largely constant up till the child reaches the school age. Around 78% of mothers report receiving some form of grandparents’ help when the child is between zero and seven years old. The help is also substantial: Grandparents take over as the primary caregiver during the daytime in over half of the cases when a child reaches age two. 30% of the two-year-olds are primarily cared for by their grandparents during the nighttime.====To provide childcare, grandparents need to shift away from labor market activities. We show this with a panel of older people. Event-study analysis indicates that older women substantially reduce their labor supply upon the arrival of their first grandchild, which is consistent with the observed sharp decline in the employment rate of Chinese women after age 45 (Panel A of Fig. 1). We find no such effects on first-time grandfather's labor market outcomes, suggesting that the labor market impact of grandparenthood is also gender-biased.====Mothers who receive grandparent-provided childcare experience much smaller interruptions in their careers relative to those who do not. Specifically, the initial shocks to employment rate, hours worked, and earnings are about one-third to 50% smaller for those who receive such help. Mothers also recover from negative shocks much sooner. When the child reaches age two, we cannot statistically reject that grandparent-assisted mothers’ labor supply has recovered to its pre-pregnancy trend. In contrast, the motherhood effect without grandparents’ help is more persistent, with no sign of their labor supply reverting to its initial trend by the end of the sample period. To partially account for selection into grandparenting, we predict the probability of receiving grandparent-provided childcare using a rich set of observed characteristics and include the interactions between the predicted probability and a full set of event time dummies. While this approach does not entirely rule out endogeneity issues, it is reassuring that we obtain quantitatively similar results.====We investigate plausible explanations for grandparenting. We find no evidence of Chinese households deliberately taking advantage of the generational gap in education and transfer childcare obligations to grandmothers whose labor is valued less in the market. We find that grandparents who have provided childcare report higher levels of subjective well-being and are more likely to receive old-age support from their adult children, even if they are no longer taking care of their grandchildren. These findings suggest that caring for grandchildren not only has consumption value for the elderly but also is a way to invest for future old-age support.====Other factors are associated with the magnitude of the motherhood effect. In particular, we show that the motherhood effect is larger for women who work in the private sector and those who have more than one child.====The magnitude of the motherhood effect may have evolved as China's economic and demographic structures have changed substantially over the past decades. Longitudinal data on individuals and households are not available for earlier periods. To estimate historical motherhood effects, we use the population censuses and intra-decennial population surveys (both are cross-sectional datasets) and adopt the pseudo-event study method proposed by Kleven et al.(2022). This approach creates a synthetic population of “future parents” who are observably similar to the observed parents. Our estimates suggest the motherhood effect has been growing rapidly in China over the past three decades. In the 1980s, having a child created barely a dent in women's labor supply; by the 2010s, women's labor force participation rate was 25 p.p. lower in the year of childbirth and remained about 5 p.p. lower in year 5.====We argue that the trend of the enlarging motherhood effect is likely to continue with China's economic and demographic transitions. Economically, the market reforms and the relative retreat of the state sector have brought about a sharp rise in gender disparity in the labor market outcomes (e.g., Gustafsson and Li, 2000; Zhang et al., 2008). Demographically, a rapidly aging population and the plummeting birth rate has recently caused the government to relax birth restrictions. Based on our estimates, these changes will likely impose heavier burdens on women's careers. Those trends may explain why, despite the relatively modest child penalty, young couples in China have hitherto lukewarm responses to recent policies promoting fertility.====This paper contributes to the large and rapidly growing literature on the gendered effects of children on labor market outcomes (Angelov et al., 2016; Kleven et al., 2019a, 2019b; Sieppi and Pehkonen, 2019; Cortes and Pan, 2020; Lundborg et al., 2017). The literature mostly focuses on western developed countries. Among the few exceptions, Berniell et al. (2021) find that motherhood leads to job informality in Chile. East Asian countries share similar family values and gender cultural roles. Dumauli (2019) finds that the presence of children at home is associated with lower wages for Japanese mothers, although she does not look at changes in mother's labor force participation, which is low in Japan. Using a similar event study approach, Park (2021) documents substantial child penalties in South Korea. Employment and earnings decline by about 70% upon the arrival of the first child. Similar to our findings, the child penalty in South Korea is mostly driven by the extensive margin, but unlike what we find in this paper, the labor market outcomes of Korean women seem never to recover from that shock. This paper is among the first to present evidence on child penalty in China, which is an important developing and transitional economy.====Existing papers in the literature typically find large and persistent negative effects of children on mothers’ labor market outcomes and virtually no impact on fathers. They also suggest that motherhood currently stands out as a key determinant of the gender disparity in labor market outcomes in high-income countries. For example, child penalty can account for 80% of the gender earnings gap in Denmark (where the overall gender earnings gap is 24%, Kleven et al., 2019b), or 65% of that in the United States (where the overall gap is 45%, Cortes and Pan, 2020). In contrast, we find that Chinese women suffer from a less persistent motherhood effect on labor outcomes. Our findings suggest that child penalty only accounts for less than 30% of the existing gender earnings inequality in China (which is 54% overall).====Prior studies also find that it is difficult to close the gender gap caused by the child penalty. The child penalty does not seem to stem from biological differences (Kleven et al., 2021), yet it nevertheless reflects some fundamental differences between men and women (Andresen and Nix, 2021). Existing studies show that popular social policies, such as subsidizing childcare (Havnes and Mogstad, 2011) and extending maternity leave (Kleven et al., 2020), have at best limited impacts on alleviating the child penalty on women relative to men (Cortes and Pan, 2020). Informal intra-family arrangements could instead be effective, as our findings suggest that grandparenting substantially reduces child penalty. However, such arrangements are embedded in the culture and tradition, and are not easily transplantable in a different society.====This study contributes to the literature on intra-family inter-generational transfers. Although many studies look at money transfers (e.g., Li et al., 2010), few examine time transfers.==== In this study, we consider time transfer by grandparents in the form of childcare in a developing country. Grandparent-provided childcare appears to be a desirable arrangement where formal childcare and eldercare are insufficient: It reduces career interruptions to mothers, increases grandparents’ subjective well-being, and better secures old-age support from their adult children. It may also improve the labor market allocation as Chinese women's education levels have improved substantially over the past few decades (Rosenzweig and Zhang, 2013). The aggregate labor market efficiency arguably has more to lose if prime-age women must leave the labor market to care for young children.====Our work also adds to a small literature on older workers’ labor market responses to grandparenthood. Our estimates of grandmother's labor supply response are much larger than estimates obtained in other countries. In China, grandmotherhood reduces labor force participation by 17.7 p.p. By contrast, previous studies find that the birth of a grandchild would reduce the labor participation of grandmothers by 8.5 p.p. in Austria (Frimmel et al., 2020), 5 p.p. in the US (Rupert and Zanella, 2018), and 1.8 p.p. in Denmark (Gørtz et al., 2020).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background. Section 3 introduces the data and the empirical method. Section 4 presents the baseline results on child penalty and explores the role of grandparenting. Section 5 shows the evolution of the motherhood effect in China over the past few decades and discusses its future trajectory. Section 6 concludes.","The motherhood penalty in China: Magnitudes, trends, and the role of grandparenting",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000725,24 November 2022,2022,Research Article,30.0

Historically, it embodied opportunity endowments that weakened fertility pressures, resulting in household formation patterns that empowered women and reduced gender ","Scholars have traced variation in contemporary gender roles across societies to several deep-rooted features of their agrarian or religious history. In the footprints of [13], one group of researchers sees the transition to agriculture in and by itself as the origin of greater gender inequality (Hansen et al., 2015), others identify the plow-using type of agriculture as the source (Alesina et al., 2013, Giuliano, 2015), and still others argue that historical scarcity of arable land strengthens agriculture’s contribution to gender inequality (Hazarika et al., 2019). With respect to religion, modern Islam has been viewed as a source of gender inegalitarian norms (Inglehart and Norris, 2003).==== In contrast, more egalitarian family patterns have been attributed to historical exposure to the Roman Catholic Church (Goody, 1983, Schulz et al., 2019, Henrich, 2020), while Protestantism has been linked to lower gender inequality in education (Becker and Woessmann, 2008).====Building on this scholarship, we theorize and provide evidence for an overlooked trajectory originating in a climatic configuration, called the “Cool Water” (CW) condition, that leads to late female marriages in preindustrial times, which in turn result in various gender egalitarian outcomes today. This article argues that the CW condition can be understood as a precursor to the agrarian and religious deep-roots discussed in the literature.====The CW condition is a specific climatic configuration that combines periodically frosty winters with mildly warm summers under the ubiquitous accessibility of fresh water. It is most prevalent in Northwestern Europe and some of its former colonial offshoots (Welzel, 2013, Welzel, 2014). We argue that, over time, household formation patterns of an agrarian economy evolve, in part, as a response to the challenges and opportunities ingrained in its climate. The CW condition embodies opportunity endowments that significantly reduced fertility pressures on women and favored late female marriages already in the preindustrial era. In CW areas, the relatively favorable disease environment implied that lower fertility was needed to achieve the desired number of children that survive into adulthood. In addition, the ubiquitous availability of water, as a fundamental agricultural input, reduced mobility costs of farming households and defied centralized control of land, which favored nuclear over extensive families and neo-locality over patri-locality. The resulting family and household patterns placed women into a better position to struggle for more gender equality during the subsequent transitions toward the industrial and post-industrial stages of development. Hence, enduring territorial differences in the CW condition predict differences in preindustrial female marriage ages, which in turn predict differences in gender equality today. Below is a schematic overview of the hypothesized causal chain: ====In support of this causal chain, we use the Cool Water index: a combination of absolute latitudes, continuous rain, and mild summers (Welzel, 2013, Welzel, 2014). We present cross-country evidence showing that CW has a sizeable and robust impact on current female marriage ages as well as the age gap between the spouses. A one standard deviation increase in the CW index is associated with a 10-month reduction of the male–female difference in mean ages at first marriage. Furthermore, we can trace this effect back to the preindustrial epoch using European historical data on marital ages from Dennison and Ogilvie (2014). Both these effects are robust to including the other ‘deep drivers’ discussed in the literature. In line with these results, we show in reduced-form estimates that CW has a large and significant impact on today’s gender gaps in labor force participation and life expectancy.====In the absence of experimental control, the two lurking threats to causal identification are reverse causality and omitted variable bias. Reverse causality is of no concern in our setting. The reason is the distinct temporal ordering of our variables along a far-reaching sequence of separate historic epochs, extending from (a) ==== environmental conditions manifest in CW to (b) ==== marriage patterns to (c) ==== gender-egalitarian outcomes.====With respect to omitted variable bias, there is always the risk that unobserved country characteristics might account for the relationship between CW and its hypothesized outcomes. In order to address this problem, we go at length in double-checking our results against many possible confounding factors. First, we conduct multiple sensitivity tests to the composition of the sample and find that our conclusions are not driven by certain world regions or subregions. Second, we control for a battery of additional variables proposed in the literature and find that the CW effect persists throughout. Third, following Oster (2019), we estimate how large the effect of unobservables needs to be to explain away the CW effect. For reasonable upper bounds on the full model’s ====, the degree of selection on unobservables would have to be almost as large as the degree of selection on the observable variables of our most restricted models. Thus, it seems unlikely that omitted variable bias alone could account for our results.====Another concern relates to the fact that countries did not exist in today’s borders invariantly throughout the temporal scope of our analyses. To address this issue, we “ancestry-adjust” the countries’ CW-scores using Putterman and Weil’s (2010) post-1500 World Migration Matrix. Doing so changes the unit of analysis from today’s countries to ancestral populations. Since this exercise fully reproduces all of our major results, it is safe to conclude that they are not an artifact of using countries in today’s borders as the unit of analysis.====As additional evidence, we show that, at the turn of the twentieth century (1880–1930), the CW condition of the country of origin correlates negatively with the marriage probability among female immigrants (first and second generation) to the US. These individual-level results suggest that the CW-effect has persisted over time because it became encoded as a cultural norm. Moreover, since immigrants living in a US state face the same institutional environment, the results further alleviate the concern that omitted institutional factors might be driving the cross-country estimates.====Finally, we present subnational evidence from the late nineteenth century Russian Empire. Using the Russian Empire’s 1897 census and exploiting the large geographical variation available, we document a strong negative association between regional CW and the share of young women (15–19) who are married. This association, while descriptive, is robust to controlling for several local measures of historical economic development.====Our main contribution is to propose a novel deep-rooted geo-climatic factor, the Cool Water condition, to explain historical and contemporary variation in sex-specific ages at first marriage. There are two prominent explanations for Northwestern Europe’s pattern of neo-locality and late ages at first marriage for women. Voigtländer and Voth (2013) argue that the mid-fourteenth century Black Death, by making land relatively more abundant, shifted production away from labor-intensive agricultural cultivation towards land-intensive animal husbandry, an activity where women have a comparative advantage. As a response to higher female labor demand, women postponed marriage and childbirth, a process which, over time, gave rise to the European marriage pattern. We show that our results are not simply capturing a Northwest European idiosyncrasy, as the Black Death explanation would suggest. Instead, the CW-effect is fully robust to excluding Northwestern Europe or controlling for the importance of animal husbandry for preindustrial subsistence.====The second explanation argues that the emergence of the European marriage pattern was a direct result of family policies promoted by the Catholic Church during the medieval period. This hypothesis, mostly prominently developed in Goody (1983), has been recently revived by Schulz et al. (2019) and Henrich (2020). In summary, it claims that the Catholic Church (or Western Church) actively undermined kin-based family patterns by, among other policies, banning polygyny and cousin marriage, and promoting marriage based on spousal consent, rather than parental consent. We show that our main findings are fully robust to controlling for a country’s length of exposure to the Western Church as measured by Schulz et al. (2019). In addition, we reproduce the main findings across regions of the historic Russian Empire, where the Orthodox (Eastern) Church has been the most dominant branch of Christianity.====Our article relates to several additional strands of literature. Our starting point is the growing consensus that gender equality in its various manifestations goes together with a host of beneficial outcomes, from economic productivity (Klasen, 2002, Klasen and Lamanna, 2009, Duflo, 2012) to distributional justice, physical security, generalized trust (Alexander and Welzel, 2015), honest government (Brollo and Troiano, 2016), effective democracy (Fish, 2002, Inglehart and Norris, 2003) and other quality of life aspects (e.g., World Bank, 2001, World Bank, 2011, Branisa et al., 2013). Many studies also highlight the importance of female agency during the preindustrial Malthusian era for the timing and pace of the fertility transition and consequent projection into the modern era of sustained economic growth.====Previous studies identify several deep historic roots of unequal gender roles that generate contemporary variation in gender equality in the labor market, political representation, and other outcomes.==== Related to societies’ agrarian past, unequal gender roles have been linked to the use of the plow (Alesina et al., 2013), longer histories of agriculture (Hansen et al., 2015), and historical scarcity of arable land Hazarika et al. (2019). We differ from these studies by proposing a novel deep-rooted factor, the CW condition, and by focusing on preindustrial marriage patterns as a key mechanism along the long-run causal chain.====In doing so, we contribute to the large literature, dating back to Hajnal, 1965, Hajnal, 1982, arguing that family systems and marriage patterns decisively shape gender roles in the preindustrial era. Several authors since Hajnal link preindustrial ages at first marriage to persistent norms of gender equality (e.g., Hartman, 2004, De Moor and Van Zanden, 2010). Empirically, historical family systems are highly persistent over time, suggesting they became embedded in cultural norms (Rijpma and Carmichael, 2016). The persistence of different regional family structures across Europe is documented, among others, by Reher (1998), Duranton et al. (2009), and Szołtysek et al. (2017). Features of historic family systems have been empirically associated with several contemporary socio-economic outcomes: patri-locality is positively associated with the number of missing women (i.e., larger sex ratios at birth) (Ebenstein, 2014), nuclear household structures are positively associated with democracy (Dilli, 2016), while Spanish regions with historical stem family systems exhibit less intimate partner violence (IPV) today than regions with historical nuclear families (Tur-Prats, 2019). We contribute to this literature by emphasizing ages at first marriage as a widely available measure of different marriage and family systems, documenting the persistence of ages at first marriage over time, showing its association with multi-dimensional gender egalitarian outcomes, and showing, across different units of analysis and time periods, how ages at first marriage are systematically explained by geo-climatic conditions.====Our results for first- and second-generation immigrants in the US relate to a literature showing that norms on gender roles are transmitted from countries of origin to emmigrant descendants through intergenerational cultural transmission (e.g., Antecol, 2000, Fernández, 2007, Bredtmann et al., 2020). Similarly, Giuliano (2007) shows that European family structures are replicated by second-generation European immigrants in the US, which is consistent with intergenerational transmission of cultural norms on family structures.====The remainder of our article proceeds in the following steps. Section 2 reviews the literature and derives from this discussion our theoretical propositions. Section 3 introduces the data and variables used to demonstrate the empirical validity of our propositions. The fourth section describes the empirical strategy while Section 5 presents the findings.

Politicians pursue their own particular interests as well as the general interests of the community; those interests often differ and conflict. The public interest can be achieved in two ways: first, by providing the right incentives to politicians; second, by selecting good politicians. This paper focuses on the latter approach: political selection is of the utmost importance because those elected are responsible for instituting and implementing policies in the interest of the society as a whole (Besley et al., 2011).====Democratic elections are the primary instrument for selecting politicians. They shape the recruitment of good politicians by affecting candidates’ decisions to run for office (Caselli and Morelli, 2004, Mattozzi and Merlo, 2008) and the parties’ selection of candidates (Galasso and Nannicini, 2011, Mattozzi and Merlo, 2015). Elections are governed by laws that define the characteristics of the electoral system in terms of ==== (the number of politicians elected in a district), ==== (how votes are translated into seats), and ==== (the voting schemes). The political economy literature largely deals with the impact of the first two of those characteristics on the recruitment of politicians (Besley, 2005, Myerson, 1993) and on policy outcomes (Persson et al., 2016), typically comparing proportional and majoritarian systems (Galasso and Nannicini, 2017, Besley and Preston, 2007). This paper instead contributes to the literature on the effect of different ballot structures within proportional representation (PR) on political selection, comparing “preference” and “non-preference” voting schemes. In the former, voters can cast votes for their preferred candidates (so, the ranking of elected politicians depends on the number of votes each candidate receives from electors). This is PR with ==== lists of candidates. In the latter, voters by contrast vote only for a party symbol that refers to a ==== list of candidates drawn up by the party (the leaders decide which candidates will enter parliament by placing them at the top of the list - PR with blocked lists) (Bowler and Farrell, 1993, Farrell, 2011).====The ballot structure can affect the selection of politicians through the relative power it accords to voters and party machines. With open lists, elected politicians should feel more accountable to the electorate than to the party: they have a stronger incentive to promote policies in the interest of voters in order to win re-election (Persson et al., 2003). On the other hand, this system may also encourage corruption through vote trading or buying (Chang and Golden, 2007) resulting in policies favoring selected interest groups. Instead, PR with blocked lists, while rewarding party loyalty rather than voter consensus, mitigates the fratricidal struggle within political parties reducing electoral campaign expenses of the single candidate (higher electoral campaign costs might favor only the wealthy at the expenses of quality).====On the basis that there is not an unambiguous prior on the direction of the causal effect of the ballot structure on politicians’ quality and on the reasonable assumption that there is a positive relationship between educational attainment and a politician’s ability (Kotakorpi and Poutvaara, 2011), in this paper we want to shed light on the effect of the Italian Parliamentary electoral reform of 1993 (which switched from open to blocked lists) on the education of politicians. We apply a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework, identifying national parliamentarians as the “treatment” group and regional councilors as the “control” group. We exploit two successive parliamentary electoral reforms (Laws 276-277/1993 and Law 270/2005), which instituted PR with blocked lists in place of PR with open lists (Laws 6/1948 and 29/1948). Over the period 1983–2014, the ballot structure with preferences prescribed by the regional council election laws (Law 108/1968 and Law 43/1995, both proportional with open lists) remained unchanged. We observe the education level of politicians before and after the treatment (the electoral reforms), which is independent of individual ability, and we estimate the causal effect of the different ballot structures in PR on the educational attainment of elected politicians.====While National and regional elections naturally differ, regional councilors nevertheless seem to be an appropriate counterfactual. Indeed, while members of parliament (MPs) have greater responsibility and prestige than regional councilors, many Italian parliamentarians have been members of local governments, which can be thought of as a kind of training ground providing useful opportunities to gaining consensus in local communities. The main identification hypothesis of the DiD methodology, namely the parallel trends in the average education of parliamentarians and regional councilors before the reform, finds robust statistical support in the data through the estimation of a fully flexible DiD model and the conducted test by Mora and Reggio (2019). Moreover, to corroborate the choice of regional councilors as a “good” control vis-à-vis the treated parliamentarians, we also restrict the sample of deputies who in the past were regional presidents or councilors.====We compare the education level between the groups of parliamentarians in different legislatures and regional councilors elected before and after the reform, performing an empirical analysis over the time-span 1983–2014. Given that Laws 276-277/1993 prescribed a mixed electoral system where only 25% of deputies were named under proportional representation with blocked lists and 75% of deputies and all senators were elected under a majoritarian rule, in our main analysis we consider deputies only.====We find that the introduction of the blocked lists resulted in deputies with lower education level than under open lists, vis-à-vis the counterfactual scenario. Specifically, the reform lowered the probability of electing university graduates deputies by between 12 and 18 percentage points. Considering the actual number of years of education, the reform led to a decrease in education by more than one year in the treatment than in the control group. To complement our baseline analysis, we also examine senators, finding a sharper reduction in their education (in this case we compare Laws of 1948 and Law 270/2005 only) than in that of deputies. We also improve the estimation of the effect of the reform on the education of elected politicians by adding several regional control variables.====We explore the plausibility of our identification strategy by estimating a fully flexible dynamic model (the event-study estimates) including the interactions of the groups dummy (treatment/control) with each of the pre- and post-reform time dummies. Following the approach of Mora and Reggio (2019), we find statistical support for the crucial assumption of parallel outcome trends among treatment and control groups prior to the reform. The dynamic impact of the reform further suggests that the lower education of parliamentarians elected with blocked lists is persistent over time.====We also investigate the gender effect of the reform, finding that women politicians were not affected, probably due to the negative stereotypes about women as policy-makers; thus, the effect is driven by the election of low-educated men.====At the time of the first electoral reform (Laws 276-277/1993) the Italian party system itself changed: the old parties disappeared and new ones were born as a consequence of a sweeping judicial investigation into political corruption known as “Clean hands” (Mani Pulite). Citizens’ hostility to the misconduct of the old parties led the new parties to engage in electoral competition by fielding more honest candidates (Chang et al., 2010, Nannicini et al., 2013) and, presumably, better educated ones. Or, on the contrary, if corrupt politicians are more educated and voters turned against more corrupt politicians after “Clean hands”,this could lead to a decline in the education of parliamentarians after 1992. Thus, the effect of “Clean hands” could confound our estimate of the effect of the Parliamentary reforms on the educational attainment of politicians. Our analysis addresses this concern by estimating a relationship between the educational attainment of deputies and an index of their misconduct (finding a negative link) and introducing dummy variables for the biggest political party in each national and regional election (thus distinguishing between the evolution of the party system as such and the effect of the introduction of blocked lists of candidates).====The reduction in deputies’ education is more pronounced when the sample is restricted to deputies elected in regional councils in the past. Moreover, to address the concern that the strengthen in fiscal federalism in Italy might have made subnational level of government more attractive, thus confounding the results, we control for the Constitutional reform of 2001.====The findings are robust to a further measure of politicians’ ability, namely a dummy for a skill-intensive occupation, as well as to comparison between “pure” proportional systems, and to the 1995 law reducing the number of preferences at regional elections. This robustness suggests that our results are unlikely to be driven by confounders or reverse causality.====The paper provides new evidence that education of elected deputies diminishes with respect to the control group when electors’ ballots change from open to blocked lists. There are two possible mechanisms in voter or party behavior that may be responsible for this effect. Do the findings imply that voters are better able to select “good” politicians than parties? Or are they consistent with an alternative interpretation that voters can observe only a restricted set of candidates’ attributes (e.g., gender, age, education), while parties have a larger set of information and use different criteria to select political candidates? To disentangle these competing explanations, information on candidates at national and regional elections are needed. Unfortunately, data on candidates’ characteristics are not available and cannot be collected. However, the estimated negative link between the misconduct of politicians and their education level, offers statistical support to the argument that the most likely driver of our results is voters’ choice in the ballot box rather than the parties’ choice of candidates in the lists. Indeed, after 1992 Italian parties tried to gain electoral consensus by selecting better, more educated, candidates in their lists. Hence, the negative effect of the electoral reform reasonably cannot be ascribed to party choices but to voters choices.",Ballot structure and political selection.

We argue that county leaders from the strong faction were less likely to pursue pro-development policies because their political survival relied on loyalty to the provincial leader than on grass-root support. By contrast, the political survival of county leaders from the weak factions depended on grassroots support, which induced local accountability and facilitated better local development. In addition, a guerrilla presence in a county further improved development performance because of the natural connections between guerrilla-affiliated cadres and local population. We find supporting evidence using county-level performance in Fujian Province in China. Being from the weak faction and/or having guerrilla presence, by improving local accountability, is associated with sizable long-term benefits including economic growth, private-sector development, local population's education levels and survival rates during the Great Famine. Being with the strong faction and adopting pro-local policies are associated with higher likelihood of political survival.","Local accountability has been viewed as being crucial for development (Bardhan 2002, 2016). The past decades have witnessed large countries such as China and India embracing decentralization, commonly considered a prerequisite for achieving local accountability. International organizations such as the World Bank have viewed it a critical governance reform (World Bank 2000). Indeed, local governments are widely viewed as having information advantage over upper-tier governments due to their proximity to local residents (Bardhan 2002), and having local accountability allows local officials to have stronger incentives to understand such needs and deliver what local citizens want (Seabright 1996).====The literature on local accountability is large and growing (for surveys, see Bardhan 2002, 2016, and Mansuri and Rao 2013). Most of the studies focus on how elections or citizen participation schemes affect service and public goods delivery. For instance, Besley and Burgess (2002) show that having a more informed and politically active electorate strengthens the incentives for governments to be responsive to citizens’ preferences. Martinez-Bravo et al. (2022) show that autocrats can use citizens’ informational advantage in local election to keep local officials accountable when their bureaucratic capacity is low. Björkman and Svensson (2009) offer causal evidence that citizen involvement improves health providers’ delivery of health services.====While this literature is informative, it has large holes to be filled. We know very little about how local accountability works in non-democratic countries: are there some forms of local accountability without elections? If so, what are the origins of such accountability? What are the effects of local accountability in such countries? Such knowledge is crucial because ==== one-party rule has been quite common in the world. Indeed, at the country level over the past four decades, about 45 percent of country-years (among a sample of 179 countries) can be characterized as having ==== one-party rule (Cruz et al., 2016).====We address the above questions by documenting how history-shaped local accountability generated differences in a rich array of development outcomes in counties of Fujian Province after the communists took power in 1949, where local politicians in some counties tended to represent the grassroots’ interest to curry their supports for political survival. Fujian is a mostly mountainous province on the southeast coast of China, separated from Taiwan by the narrow Taiwan Strait. It has an area of 120 thousand square kilometers; today it is home to a population of nearly 40 million. When the reform started in 1978, Fujian ranked in the bottom 7 out of the 30 provinces then; in 2017, it ranked in top 6 among all provinces.==== In 2016, its GDP per capita is 11,247 USD (and 21,339 in Purchasing Power Parity, PPP). Thus, within the Chinese economic growth miracle, Fujian has been a superstar performer, having experienced the most complete reversal of fortunes.====We investigate the role of local accountability in explaining the large variations in the development performance across counties in Fujian Province. The set of county-level development outcomes we examine in this paper includes: the economic growth rates between 1952 and 1998, and in the post-reform period (i.e., 1978 to 1998); the improvement in educational attainment between 1952 and 1990; the level of private-sector development; and net birth rates and death rates during the Great Chinese Famine between 1959 and 1961. We also empirically examine whether political survival is part of our story.====We then shed light on the underlying mechanisms that link the local accountability, and the development outcomes at the county level. The intuition is as follows. When the Communist armies took over Fujian province from the Nationalist control circa 1949, the designated county leaders consisted of cadres mainly from two army factions - namely, the Third Field Army (FA3, henceforth), and the Yangtze-River Detachment (YRD). These cadres were commonly known as “southbound cadres” because they came from northern provinces. The Fujian Provincial Standing Committee of the Communist Party, however, had always been dominated by members from FA3, which we refer to as the “strong faction,” during the period we examine. We argue that county leaders’ incentives regarding local development depended on whether they were from the strong faction (FA3) that dominated the provincial government. If a county leader belonged to FA3, then he was less likely to pursue policies that were friendly to local development because, as a political incumbent, his political survival depended more on his connections to the provincial leaders. On the other hand, if a local leader belonged to the weaker faction, his political survival depended more on local grassroots support, which could be best secured if he focused on local economic development. In addition, the guerrilla presence in the county also improved development performance for two reasons: it facilitated local accountability of the county leader because guerrilla-affiliated leaders also did not have connections with the strong faction; and it better facilitated the communication between local cadres and local residents. We argue that the above mechanisms explain our finding that counties with leaders from the weaker political factions (i.e., those with YRD cadres or guerrilla-related cadres) have significantly better development outcomes in almost all the measures we examined.====Fujian Province offers a particularly suitable place to examine how local accountability affects long-term development. Due to exogenous historical reasons, some counties were governed by cadres with strong connections to provincial leaders, while others were governed by cadres with weak connections. Moreover, a significant share of counties had a Communist guerrilla presence before the 1949 takeover. Intuitively, local leaders with weak connections and those in charge of counties in which guerrilla factions were present likely had to depend more on grassroots support for political survival, and, thus, their development-related political choices should have resulted in systematical differences in long-term development. Finally, Fujian is a southeastern province distant from Beijing and less exposed to the intervention from the central authority, which likely offered more room for the cadres with weak connections to survive.====A challenge for identifying the effects of local accountability (weak faction or guerrilla) is that they may not be exogenous to long-term development. Better local accountability may facilitate long-term development, while development itself may increase local accountability (Bardhan 2002). We do our best to ensure that the outcomes indeed reflect causal effects. First, we provide institutional background that how different counties in Fujian Province ended up being connected to provincial leaders is likely exogenous with respect to our indicators of long-term development. Indeed, we find that local accountability is not systematically related to initial income levels or population levels; they do appear to be related to some extent to geography, which we control for in our empirical specifications. Second, in assessing the impact of local accountability, we control for initial income, population, and local geography. The differences that we find are, thus, not a result of geography. Clearly, these counties shared the same legal system, religion, and culture. Because we also control for the initial level of economic development in the county, the results cannot be attributed to conditional convergence. Third, the estimates of the effects of the two key variables are remarkably stable regardless of the amount of control, which is suggestive of exogenous assignment (Angrist and Pischke, 2009). Fourth, the key results remain robust when we only use the geographically neighboring-county pairs with different affiliation. We also test the key assumptions behind our story. For instance, our framework asserts that political survival would be higher when the county leader was affiliated with the strong faction or had grassroots support; indeed, we find support by using evidence of political survival during the Cultural Revolution. We also find counties with weak-faction leaders and a local guerrilla presence adopted stronger pro-local policies, as demonstrated by lower death rates during the Great Famine around 1960, greater private-sector development, and greater advances in schooling attainment before and after the power change in 1949.====Our empirical results yield coherent findings consistent with our expectation. First, counties with weak-faction leadership have an annual growth rate premium (in gross value of output) of 0.9 percentage points in the 1952–1998 period, and this premium increases to 1.9 percentage points in the two post-reform decades. Similarly, counties with a guerrilla presence have an annual growth premium of 0.5 (1.5, respectively) percentage points in the 1952–1998 (1978–1998, respectively) period. The effects are especially pronounced when a county had both weak-faction leadership and a guerrilla presence; counties with this combination experienced a growth rate premium (relative to strong-faction counties) that was often double that of counties that had weak-faction leadership but no guerrilla presence. The growth effects of being affiliated with the weak faction and having guerrilla presence are much more pronounced during the dynamic reform period of 1994 to 1998. Second, weak-faction counties had significantly lower death rates and smaller reduction in birth rates during the Great Chinese Famine around 1960. Third, the change in average schooling levels for affected cohorts after the power change was positive and significantly larger – by around 37.5 percentage points – in counties with weak-faction leaders and a guerrilla presence (relative to the strong-faction counties). Fourth, weak-faction counties were more conducive to private-sector development. State-owned enterprise (SOE) shares as measured by sales revenue in a county were about 22 percentage points lower in weak-faction counties than in strong-faction counties. Fifth, we provide evidence to directly support the political survival mechanism. In particular, in counties with the strong-faction leadership or with lower death rates during the Great Chinese Famine, leaders who were purged during the initial years of the Cultural Revolution tended to be reinstalled earlier or, were more likely to be reinstalled. This suggests that both affiliation with the strong faction and grassroots support are central for political survival in the autocratic regime. Finally, we offer further checks – such as whether fiscal transfers explain the differences in development outcomes – which allow us to exclude this alternative interpretation. In general, our results are remarkably robust to specifications with different controls, to outlier concerns, and to using only the neighboring-county treatment-control pairs.====Our paper is related to several strands of literature in political economy. First, it is related to a recent literature on the effect of local accountability on development, which focuses on the role of elections and local political participation in facilitating public goods delivery and local welfare (Besley and Burgess 2002; Bjorkman and Svensson 2009, Bardhan 2002, 2016; Mansuri and Rao, 2013; Martinez-Bravo et al., 2022; Shen and Yao 2008; Zhang et al., 2004). The literature on local accountability in nondemocratic countries other than on local elections is relatively small, and the focus is generally on upward accountability (i.e., accountability to the superiors) for the purpose of promotions (Li and Zhou 2005).==== In our paper, local guerrilla presence prior to the Communist takeover and the lack of strong connection to upper-tier governments serve as proxies for local accountability. We find that local accountability plays an important role in regulating the behavior of local politicians to be more favorable to local economic development in a non-democratic setting. We show that local accountability is positively associated with many different aspects of development (i.e., growth, education, private-sector development, and the extent of famine) and at different stages of half a century of political and economic transformation in China. These results suggest that local accountability is a powerful, robust, and balanced mechanism for ensuring long-term development. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider the presence of guerrillas as well as the lack of connections to upper-tier governments as the historical origins of local accountability, and to study its comprehensive impact on local economic growth and other pro-local policies. We also add nuances to the local governance literature. While the literature typically assumes that local governance results in more responsible and locally-accountable local governments (Bardhan 2002), we provide evidence that whether this was true depend on the connections between local officials and upper-tier governments. Furthermore, this literature emphasizes the tradeoff involved in local governance, with the benefits of better local information and local accountability, and the costs of potential local capture by local elites after decentralization (Bardhan 2016). Our finding of strong positive effects of local accountability in our context is suggestive that where the upper-tier government power is strong, the benefits of local accountability could heavily outweigh its costs.====Second, our paper is related to the literature on the role of accountability for political survival in autocracies. The main idea from the literature is that in autocracies, concerns about political survival drive the political leader to satisfy the demands of the citizens in order to avoid large-scale revolutions (Acemoglu and Robinson 2001, 2006; Smith 2008; Bueno de Mesquita and Smith 2008, 2010). In the context of China, Zhang et al. (2021) provide evidence that historical elite cleavages motivated marginalized local cadres to protect local entrepreneurs and facilitated vibrant private economic activities. Our paper focuses on the survival incentives of local leaders rather than those of national leaders. In our setup, local leaders can increase their chances of political survival either by strengthening their ties to higher-level officials, or by mobilizing grassroots support from within their jurisdiction, and we provide direct evidence from the power purge and reinstatement during the Cultural Revolution. Moreover, we emphasize the role of local accountability in shaping local leaders’ policy-making incentives.====Finally, our paper is related to the literature political incentives in communist China.==== Most of the studies on factions in China focus on the post-reform period. Shih (2008) provides a systematic analysis of political ties based on networks of leaders, and studies the impact of elite politics on monetary and banking policies. Shih et al. (2012) examine the role of political ties with top leaders in the promotion to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Francois et al. (2017) model political ties in China and present empirical regularities. Few papers study the impact of political ties based on military affiliations. One exception is Zhang and Liu (2019), who examine a possible causal relationship between a region's communist revolutionary legacy before 1949 and the variation in private-sector development after 1949 in Zhejiang province. Our paper delves more deeply and more systematically into the broad impact on a variety of development performance measures of the counties led by southbound cadres from different military affiliations. Political incentives in China have been perhaps the most influential area of economic study on China, with most existing work focusing on the promotion incentives of top-level government officials (Maskin et al., 2000; Li and Zhou, 2005; Shih et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2015). Our paper differs in offering the complementary perspective of the importance of incentives for political survival for local government officials—after all, for most politicians, they do not get the chance to be promoted, and keeping their power is their key concern. We find that at the county level, local leaders with historical ties with the provincial government achieve lower growth performance than those without such upper-tier connections. We also differ in shedding light on incentives that exist outside the formal Communist hierarchy: local accountability that stemmed from the relationship between local officials and local citizens inherited from their revolutionary history. Our paper thus complements Persson and Zhuravskaya (2015), which find that top provincial leaders’ prior experience within the province is associated with more public expenditures on education and health, and less on construction, which are both consistent with the goal of improving local welfare. They suggest that a channel for their findings is that provincial leaders with local work experience tend to cater to local elites, who in turn exert positive spillover to the local population. Our paper complements theirs in underscoring the importance of local accountability of the local leaders for the spillover effects to benefit the local population, and in showing that local accountability represented a positive force for economic growth, protection of citizen lives at the time of Great Famine, improving local education, and successful dealing with economic turbulence, with magnitudes indicating first-order importance.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present a simple example to highlight effect on development performance of local accountability and derive its implications. In Section 3 we provide institutional background on army affiliations and local guerrilla movements in the post-civil-war county and provincial governments of Fujian Province. In Section 4 we describe our data sources, and present summary statistics for some of the key variables of interest. In Section 5 we present our empirical results, as well as robustness checks and alternative explanations. Section 6 offers conclusions.","Political survival, local accountability, and long-term development: Evidence from an authoritarian country",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000695,26 October 2022,2022,Research Article,33.0

This literature constitutes a multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research highlighting important linkages in the coupled climate-human system.====The motivation of this work consists in better understanding the links between climate and conflicts by adding a new piece in this literature. The positive association between climate and conflicts has been empirically highlighted in a recent literature (Hsiang et al., 2011, Hsiang et al., 2013, Burke et al., 2015b, Burke et al., 2015a): for example, Hsiang et al. (2013) identified an empirical connection between climate change and conflicts across 12,000 years of human history. The conflict terminology is a proxy of intergroup violence and social interactions, as classified by Burke and Hsiang (2016). Then, climate variations may influence relationships between different groups in society and can lead to social disturbances, for instance civil unrest, including riots or insurrections. In this respect, climate change is likely to increase civil conflicts and protests inside a country. Land invasion in Brazil (Hidalgo et al., 2010) or civil war induced by droughts in Somalia (Maystadt and Ecker, 2014) are examples of such cases. More generally, climate can generate interpersonal violence (Hsiang et al., 2013, Burke et al., 2015a), from low-level aggression to violent crimes (see Ranson, 2014 for example) through physiological and cognitive mechanisms and even suicides (Burke et al., 2018).====However, the link between climate and violence remains a controversial topic despite the existence of a very huge literature. Adams et al. (2018) considered that the connections between climate change and conflicts were overstated by sample biases, since the countries that were mentioned most were also the most violent ones recently. In the same vein, some researchers moderate the previous positive correlation’s results between climate and violence and find weak or no consistent correlation between climate and conflict: not only Buhaug, 2010a, Buhaug, 2010b,==== stressing on the lack of control variables, but also Buhaug et al. (2014), Koubi et al. (2012), Raleigh et al. (2014) or O’Loughlin et al. (2014). Similarly, recent studies find that the climate-conflict relationship is strongly context dependent: Von Uexkull et al. (2016) underlines the effects of local droughts on violence for agriculturally dependent groups as well as politically excluded groups in very poor countries whereas Ide et al. (2020) highlight that the relationship between disasters and conflict is highly conditional, occurring almost exclusively in countries with ethnic exclusion, low levels of human development and large populations. Böhmelt et al. (2014) show that demand-side drivers, such as population pressure, agricultural productivity, and economic development are likely to have a stronger impact on water conflict risk than supply-side factors, represented by climate variability. More broadly, some researchers such as Ide (2017) have pointed to the limits of current quantitative approaches and the need of a complementary qualitative approach to well understand the exact mechanisms through which climate change affects violent conflict.====In this paper, we add a new piece in this literature by adopting a long-term historical perspective to empirically understand the links between climate and violence with long time series, in the vein of Tol and Wagner (2010) and Burke and Hsiang (2014). Indeed, Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2006 and, to a lesser extent, 2011) suggested that the link between climate and conflicts is not recent and already existed in pre-industrial societies. We focus on the pre-industrial Europe to naturally experiment the effect of extreme weather and climate change on conflicts. Indeed, our sample period (1300–1900 and more especially 1500–1800) falls within the period of lowest temperatures at any time in the past millennium, the so-called Little Ice Age (see for instance Osborn and Briffa, 2006).==== Cooling periods in feudal Europe are also likely to have been a major cause of economic and human crisis via social disturbances (Zhang et al., 2011 or Parker, 2013).====As previously explained by Zhang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2011 and Pei et al. (2013), a large geographic scale can help us to understand the complex interactions between nature and human society, while focusing on a specific socioeconomic period (pre-industrial Europe in this case) can help us to interpret the relationship between climate and socioeconomic variables. Our study thus brings an interesting contribution to the literature on the long-term impact of climate change. Only a limited number of studies have quantitatively detected the short- and long-term impacts of climate variations on society during the pre-industrial era (Pei et al., 2013, Pei et al., 2014, Kaniewski and Marriner, 2020), especially in the economic literature.====For the first time, we used a new time-varying copula methodology to re-investigate the empirical association between climate and conflicts. By the way, this paper tries to take into account several potential issues in the previous literature. At least, this paper provides an alternative view to analyze the dependence between climate and conflicts. In addition, conflicts were defined very generally as encompassing both social disturbances or riots, and wars. Although previous papers have generally been more interested in wars, we expected to find positive correlations between social troubles and wars, and therefore investigated them simultaneously. Copula methodology was interesting in that it enables us to investigate the dependence of two variables in a complex way, while time-varying analysis enables us to classify periods with zero, negative or positive dependence and study temporal heterogeneities. Contrary to a correlation, the copula approach can highlight extreme dependencies for very high or low values of the studied series and is particularly suitable to quantitatively investigate climate series characterized by rare and strong event (droughts, floods, hurricanes, hot wave). In addition, Copula-based methodology enables us to highlight the possible asymmetry of the dependencies between climate and conflicts. Nevertheless, note that the copula methodology is not a per se causality method and do not give information about which one of the two series drives or leads the other one.====In our context, the time varying copula methodology provides a way of making a distinction between periods of close association between climate and violence or social disorders and periods without any correlation. Using historical records, we can explain whether the periods identified by our empirical methodology can be explained by any particular events. Finally, this methodology is interesting to identify whether the relationship between climate and conflict is a mean relationship or stems from extreme events, and whether it is stable over time and gradual or, on the contrary, whether particular sub-periods are driving the negative correlation found in the previous literature. Finally, as also stressed by De Juan and Wegenast (2019), temporal variability has received substantially less attention than spatial variability. However, it is particularly important if we want to assess the potential impact of climate change on violence in the future.====From a climatology point of view, taking into account the Little Ice Age enables us to proxy important climate (cold) changes and infer some results about climate change. From a society/policy point of view, working on pre-industrial Europe is interesting to show how economic or social vulnerability might lead to, or reinforce effects of climate on conflicts. Considering (Tol and Wagner, 2010), the economies in the 1600’s were very similar (in income comparisons) to some vulnerable developing countries today. Since the developing countries are particularly concerned by probable future climate change (Burke et al., 2015b), our cliometric investigation can help policy makers warn populations and implement suitable climate change mitigation policies. From a methodology point of view, focusing on the 1500–1800 period leads us to compare our results with some benchmark studies and check their robustness (especially Tol and Wagner, 2010, Zhang et al., 2011). In addition, focusing on a long-run period enables us to use relatively rich data, considering the abundance of detailed records during this particular period and thus to conduct time series causal identification. In addition, large-scale data and historical analysis enable us to avoid some potential sampling bias, especially in panel studies, as pointed out by Adams et al. (2018), since we focus on a relatively homogeneous subset of European countries. From a history point of view, the period covers the macroeconomic and general human crisis of the seventeenth century (Fischer, 1996, Parker, 2013) already studied by Zhang et al. (2011) or Pei et al., 2014, Pei et al., 2015.==== The contribution of our paper is not only to revisit the climate/violence link using historical long-run data but also to apply a new empirical methodology to this literature. Unlike previous literature that used correlation and Granger causality in time series with filtered data (Zhang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2011) or regression analysis (Tol and Wagner, 2010), we applied a time varying copula methodology to non-transformed data. (1) Using non-transformed data enables us to avoid the so-called ’Slutsky effect’ outlined by Kelly and Gráda (2014). (2) The copula methodology, usually computed in finance and/or in risk management enables us to investigate the co-movements between two series by capturing a myriad of complex and nonlinear dependence relationships, especially tail and asymmetric dependencies; indeed, the copula methodology is able to model all the joint distribution between the variables and capture the influence of extreme events in tails – like extreme weather and climate events that are rare events by definition – on other variables such as proxies of violence in this paper. Thus, the copula approach provides a specific assessment of changes in the tails of the joint distribution. (3) We use a time-varying copula approach to take into account the fact that the association might be limited to only specific time periods and takes into account temporal heterogeneity (as outlined for example by Van Baalen and Mobjörk (2018) of the association between climatic conditions and violent conflict. Identifying the sub-periods enables us to better identify the causal channels at work between climate and conflicts and some potential co-founders such as agricultural productivity and fiscal pressure.====As far as we know, this study was the first to use copulas and time-varying copula analysis in the climate-economics literature and therefore in the analysis of climate and conflicts in a time-series historical context. Copula analysis identified a positive dependence between temperatures and conflicts, and negative or positive dependence between precipitation anomalies and conflicts, by focusing explicitly on the joint distribution of our variables. Moreover, using the time-varying approach, we were able to precisely identify the periods/regimes during which the link between climate and conflict was genuinely active. In addition, we tried to link these dependence regimes to historical information to identify a causal pattern between climate and the so-called “general crisis” including macroeconomic crisis, revolts, social and political conflicts. The impact of climate on bioproductivity and cereal yield leading to famines and poor macroeconomic indicators has been suggested previously in the literature (Zhang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2011, Pei et al., 2014). We checked the robustness of this causal pattern and added new mechanisms to investigate the ex-post link between economic crisis, famine and the likelihood of protests and wars linked to a variation in climate.====Finally, a last original contribution of this paper is related to the empirical data selected to capture weather extremes and climate variations. In order to test the potential climate origins (see for example Parker (2013)) of the cooling period induced by the Little Ice Age on human behaviors, we investigate the effects of ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) and NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) Teleconnections whereas previous long-term historical studies have only focused on precipitation and temperature data. Indeed, the origin of the Little Ice Age period studied in this paper might be linked to significant variations in NAO or ENSO. Studying these Teleconnections is a mean to better feature the climate/conflicts links and capture ex ante effects of the climate on conflicts and not only ex post effects via temperatures and precipitations. It could be interesting to forecast climate variations and potential increased violence episodes and to earlier alert governments and local authorities.==== Although the Copula are not a new concept (Sklar, 1959), their application is very recent (Patton, 2012) and for the first time, we applied this method to the climate/conflict literature. This method has several merits to address the relationship between climatic factors and conflicts. Previous results are based on very simple mean correlations coefficients leading to some doubts about the existence of a true causal relationship. The effects of climate on conflicts are likely to be nonlinear and be the result from complex relationships between rare and extreme climatic events (droughts or floods, very cold or heat waves) rather mean temperatures or precipitations, and also extreme outcomes consisting in surge in agricultural yields and prices, social disturbances or wars. Copula method is a powerful statistical method taking into account this complexity by considering the entire joint distribution between two series and able to highlight the links behind the “simple” picture. In addition, the time varying process enables us to identify the specific active time periods when some . Contrary to previous literature, it enables to detect the most reliable sub-periods when climatic variation has led to violence and to identify the main specific co-founders at work for these specific historical sub-periods. Weakness: The method consists in a pair dependence? need to test enough potential distributions to fit the most plausible dependence form?====The rest of our paper is structured as follows.

We also employ an instrument variable approach and carry out a series of robustness checks to further confirm the findings.,"Child labor has many short- and long-term negative effects, such as reduction in human capital accumulation (Heady, 2003; Gunnarsson et al., 2006; Dumas, 2012; O'Donnell et al., 2005) and adverse effects on the future labor market outcomes (Emerson and Souza, 2011). Obviously, the welfare at both individual level and national level will be impeded by such negative impacts.====Understanding the factors behind child labor is an important topic in the literature. In this paper, we focus on the role of clan culture on child labor in China. Our study shows that clan culture acts as a supplement to formal financial market by reducing the incidence of child labor through risk sharing and easing credit constraints, which enriches the literature on the macro factors behind the incidence of child labor, such as the role of public policies, globalization and financial development (Dehejia and Gatti, 2005; Edmonds and Pavcnika, 2005; Dinopoulos and Zhao, 2007; Tang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021).====An imperfect financial market in developing countries leads to high levels of child labor engagement for two reasons (Baland and Robinson, 2000; Ranjan, 2001; Udry, 2003). Firstly, the benefits of child labor come from the current wage earned by the child and the reduced cost of schooling. However, the cost of child labor is the future labor earnings impeded by involved in child labor. When facing credit constraints, a higher interest rate in an imperfect financial market leads to a lower present discounted value of the future labor earnings. Thus, the benefits would be higher relative to the cost, resulting in higher incidence of child labor (Udry, 2003). Secondly, decisions regarding child labor and schooling are generally made by parents, which raise the issue of agent problems. Agent problems become even more salient when they occur within imperfect financial markets (Udry, 2003). Even amongst altruistic parents, the proportion of child labor can produce a socially inefficient equilibrium, as imperfect financial markets prevent parents from fully internalizing negative effects (Baland and Robinson, 2000; Udry, 2003). Besides, as a part of the household's self-insurance strategy, child labor supply will increase when household facing negative shocks, especially when the insurance market is not well developed (Jacoby and Skoufias,1996; Beegle et al., 2006; De Janvry et al., 2006).====Culture is a vital informal institution, and is identified in emerging economies as a crucial determinant of many economic outcomes, especially when the formal institution is poorly developed (Guiso et al., 2006; Fernández, 2011; Voigtländer and Voth, 2012; Alesina and Giuliano, 2015). However, there are few economic studies focusing on the impact of culture on child labor. Thus, our study also contributes to the growing literature of cultural economics by examining the impact of clan culture on the incidence of child labor in China.====We focus on China for three reasons. Firstly, although the enrollment rates of primary and junior high schools are high in China,==== approximately 7.74% of children aged between 10 and 15 years were engaged in child labor in 2010 (Tang et al., 2018). It is crucial to investigate how to reduce the child labor participation in China. Secondly, clan culture is a well-known hallmark of Chinese culture (Greif and Tabellini, 2010, 2017; Zhang, 2020). Whilst official clan organizations were largely abolished following the Chinese Communist Party's rise to power in 1949, the influences of clan culture are likely to persist and continue to have an important impact on the behavior of individuals in modern China (Greif and Tabellini, 2010, 2017). Thirdly, China is the largest transition and developing economy, but has yet to establish a well-developed financial market, legal system, and social safety system, particularly in rural areas. In such context, clan culture plays the role of formal institutions in promoting information and risk sharing, reducing transaction costs, overcoming financial constraints for enterprises, and easing credit constraints for its members (Weber, 1981; Peng, 2004; Greif and Tabellini, 2010; Cox and Fafchamps, 2007; Zhang, 2020). Besides, clans also provide public goods and services for clan members (Fei, 1946; Freedman, 1965; Tsai, 2007; Gerard et al., 2015).====Combing the theories of child labor determination and the functions of clan culture, we hypothesize that clan culture can influence the engagement of child labor. Clan culture, as a supplement to formal institutions, may reduce the labor supply of children from poor families by easing credit constraints and promoting risk sharing. Moreover, this impact is supposed to be biased toward boys due to the patrilineal clan nature.====To test our hypotheses, we use the indicator of whether a household has a genealogy book as a key measure of the strength of clan culture at the household level following existing literature (Peng, 2004; Chen et al., 2016; Greif and Tabellini, 2017; Zhang, 2020). Having a genealogy book means the household subscribing to a clan. Thus, this paper focuses on the differences between clan members and non-clan members, other than the impacts of clan culture to regional outcomes or all individuals. That is, rather than exploring the role of external cultural environment (Guiso et al., 2004), we pay more attention to the intergenerational cultural transmission of preferences and beliefs within families (Tabellini, 2008), social norm among clan members, and the effect of being a clan member.====Besides using a household level indicator, we also explore to measure the strength of clan culture by the surname concentration in the village following Peng (2004). Employing our two measures of clan culture, we attempt to separately identify the potential effects of external origins and family origins. On the one hand, concentration of the same surname reflects the strength of clan culture in the village, regardless of household norms. On the other hand, the genealogy books measures the importance of clan culture to a particular household, after controlling the village level indicator of clan culture.====Based on national representative data, the China Family Panel Studies, we find that clan culture can significantly reduce the incidence of child labor. The results are driven by boys rather than girls. The differential effects between boys and girls indicate a strong engrained bias towards boys within the clan culture since its patrilineal nature, which influences parents to allocate resources towards boys. Moreover, the impact is greater on boys from households with lower socioeconomic status, and in rural areas.====We investigate risk sharing, informal financial institution and social norm on promoting education as three mechanisms through which clan culture influences the incidence of child labor. Specifically, clan culture has a greater impact on reducing child labor engagement amongst boys when serious disasters occur. Additionally, clans are more likely to help fathers of boys, if they fall into difficulty. Finally, we provide evidence of how clan culture may increase study time and household educational expenditure on boys.====Our paper contributes to existing literature in several ways. Firstly, it enriches the literature of exploring the impacts of culture on economic development. As existing literature shows, culture can effectively influence labor participation decision, fertility decision, schooling decisions, academic performance, wage rate, and labor mobility (e.g., Fernández, 2007; Guiso et al., 2008; Fernández and Fogli, 2009; Giavazzi et al., 2013; Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2006; Pitt et al., 2012). However, seldomly do they focus on child labor participation. We emphasize that culture can also influence human capital accumulation and economic development through the child labor channel.====Secondly, we contribute to existing child labor determination literature (Dehejia and Gatti, 2005; Edmonds and Pavcnika, 2005; Basu et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021) by identifying a new influencing factor: clan culture. Since formal institutions are weak in most developing countries, exploring the role of culture in child labor provides a new insight to understanding the determination and distribution of child labor.====Thirdly, this paper highlights the potential threat associated with reliance on informal institutions and culture, such as clans, to fill the void of under-developed formal institutions, since the informal institution and culture can be gender biased.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces clan culture in China; Section 3 describes the data and outlines the empirical strategy; Section 4 presents and discusses the main results; Section 5 provides robustness checks; Section 6 conducts heterogeneity analyses; Section 7 explores potential mechanisms and possible interpretations of the main findings; Section 8 provides concluding comments.",Informal institution meets child development: Clan culture and child labor in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000671,8 October 2022,2022,Research Article,35.0

The findings show that trade accelerates the industrial similarities between counties. The evolution of similarity is unequal between regions and over time, as ==== in neighboring counties that belong to different dialect regions become more similar than industries within the same dialect region. The rise in industrial similarity is being fueled by the emergence of high-skill-intensive businesses as a result of trade-related technology spillovers. Adjacent counties of different dialects have greater skill endowments, which facilitate information transfer.","The literature on the function of formal institutions in industrial agglomeration and industrial similarity is substantial. However, little is known about the impact of informal institutions such as culture, which is defined as traditional ethnic, religious, and social beliefs, language, and values passed down from generation to generation. Using a comprehensive firm-level dataset from China that spans from 1998 to 2007, our study fills this gap by revealing the causal relationship between cultural division and industrial similarity during the process of trade liberalization. Understanding the linkage is essential to China and many African countries where trade liberalization has occurred amid cultural and linguistic diversity.====The present paper has two focuses. First, it analyzes the effects of trade shocks on industrial similarity within a region by leveraging cross-market variance in import exposure. As noted in Imbs (2004), the similarity of industries for two distinct regions measures the industrial interconnection and reliance. We also compare the similarity index with the industrial co- agglomeration index in Ellison et al. (2010), and the results show that these two indices are substantially correlated. Our findings help to understand the impact of trade on the industrial connectedness of two adjacent counties, which has received little attention in the literature. Second, this paper examines the impact of cultural division on the dynamics of industrial simi- larity during trade liberalization. We devise a novel study design to distinguish cultural impact from institutional effect. In particular, to disentangle cultural effects from other effects, such as institutional factors, we carefully select the research units – pairs of neighboring counties located in the same prefecture.====The analyses yield several classes of results. First, the empirical estimates suggest that, overall, industries in two neighboring counties become more assimilated, regardless of whether they belong to the same or a different dialect division. Quantitatively, a one thousand dollar increase in regional exposure to imports per person increases the industrial similarity by approximately 9.4% for all counties in our sample. Second, cultural division plays a substantial role in shaping industrial similarity for regions that face exogenous trade shocks. Although the level of industrial similarity is higher for counties within the same dialect division at the beginning of the period, there is an additional increase in industrial similarity of 0.2 percentage points for counties with different dialects from a one thousand dollar increase in regional exposure to imports, which represents a 11.7% increase for counties with different dialects. This allows counties with different dialects to close the gap in industrial similarity compared to counties with the same dialects. Our findings are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks (see Section 4.2 for details).====Industrial location is driven by exogenous endowments such as technologies, labor, and natural resources, and the spatial pattern is formed through interindustry specialization with industries settling in locations with comparative advantages. Trade liberalization increases the scope for specialization along the lines of comparative advantage and enhances the importance of access to international markets (Melitz,2003;Melitz and Ottaviano,2008). Our results support this theory.====Since the influential paper of Coe and Helpman(1995), several studies have found that the international transmission of technology through the channel of trade has been a significant contributor to industrial agglomeration within a region. However, the transfer of technology is highly asymmetric across regions within a country, and regions whose industrial structures are more skill-intensive will facilitate such growth; therefore, industrial agglomeration occurs. We further investigate whether cultural segregation leads to differential abundance of skills across regions. The results show that two neighboring counties that belong to different dialect groups are actually equipped with a higher level of skills when compared to counties within the same dialect region. Furthermore, by reducing skills in neighboring counties with the same dialect and raising skills in neighboring counties with different dialects, trade increases the variety of skill abundance.====Trade-based information exchange has been shown to contribute to economic agglomeration on a global scale. However, there is a significant disparity in technology transfer between the regions of a nation. The amount of technology transferred when China imports goods and technology from more developed countries varies greatly depending on the abundance of local skilled labor and the skill intensity of industries, which supports the expansion of high-skilled sectors. The rise of high-skilled industries should therefore outperform the growth of low-skilled sectors. As a result, counties with more skill-intensive industrial structures would aid this growth, which leads to industrial agglomeration. Our findings imply that increased industrial similarity is mostly due to the rise of high-skill-intensive industries as a result of trade-related technology spillovers. Counties with distinct dialects have a greater skill abundance, which facilitates information spillovers and enhances high-skill industry similarities.====Additionally, we perform several heterogeneous analyses. We first divide the cities into high and low trade exposure based on their position in the distribution of trade value. In cities that were more exposed to trade, industries became more assimilated. We further classify cities into high and low skills according to the educational attainment of the labor force. When a city has a higher proportion of high-skilled workers, the results show that industries become increasingly comparable and thus build more agglomerated industrial structures. Finally, we test the impact of government connection on industrial similarity by exploring the difference between capital and non-capital cities. Closer government relations signify more government control and intervention in the establishment of industry policies, which prevents capital cities from becoming increasingly similar.====As with all studies that employ a Bartik instrument or shift-share approach, it is important to verify the validity of our findings. There are two sources of violation. One arises from the shift part, or the trade shocks are not independent of local market conditions. To alleviate the concern, we conduct several sensitivity tests, including controlling for the pre-existing trends in the sectoral changes in the local labor market. We also show that pre-period changes in the outcomes of interest are uncorrelated with subsequent trade shocks predicted by the instrument. To put it in a formal test, we perform a balancing test proposed under the identification assumptions in Borusyak et al.(2018) and show that at a more aggregated industry level, exports are uncorrelated with an industry-specific weighted average of other local shocks such as changes in educational attainment, the employment share, the number of firms, regional GDP, etc.====The other source is from the geographic distribution of the industrial structure. It is possible that our results are simply due to varying industrial specialization across regions. For instance, prefectures that initially specialized in industries that require large capital investment would experience a relative increase in industrial concentration over this period even without import shocks. This issue is at the heart of Goldsmith-Pinkham et al.(2020), who emphasizes how, with shift-share-style variables, identification relies on the exogeneity of the initial industry shares. We thus calculate Rotemberg weights as proposed by Goldsmith-Pinkham et al.(2020) and show that they are less concentrated in a few industries. Both validity tests suggest that our shift-share instrument yields consistent estimates.====Our paper brings together three strands of literature. It first adds to the growing literature on culture and economic outcomes, with a particular interest in the determinants of industrial agglomeration. There are two common ways in the literature to measure culture. One is based on survey questions, whose answers are aggregated at the country level to measure values and beliefs. The other approach is based on a clear division in language, religion, or ethnicity. It is increasingly recognized that culture is an important determinant of a series of economic outcomes, including international trade, distribution policy, corruption, etc. (Guiso et al.,2009; Barr and Serra,2010;Luttmer and Singhal,2011). Our study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to explore the impact of culture on the industrial similarity of two areas.====Second, this paper complements previous studies about the determinants of industrial agglom- eration in the context of China. Using the same database that we use, Lu and Tao(2009) find that industrial agglomeration in China increased steadily between 1998 and 2005, although it is still considerably lower than that of selected developed countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Bai et al.(2004) study the impact of local protectionism, as measured by the share of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), on industrial agglomeration in China. They note that less geographic concentration is found in industries with stronger local government protection. The findings in our study lend some support to their results and provide affirmative evidence that both international trade and interconnections with the government play important roles in shaping the industrial structure of the local economy. Moreover, we show that cultural division across regions also matters.====Our paper also relates to the literature on culture and trade. One strand of the literature examines how culture affects trade. Aker et al.(2014) uses data from Niger and argues that transaction costs are higher for trade between regions with different ethnicity than for trade in homogeneous areas. On the one hand, trust is higher among people of the same ethnic group, and this reduces transaction costs. On the other hand, ethnic diversity may lead to specialization and complementarity in production that increases the motivation for trade. Another strand of the literature examines how trade affects culture. Gershman(2020) finds that the historical African slave trade contributed to the propagation of persistent witchcraft beliefs. Areas that were more exposed to the slave trade have a lower level of trust currently (Nunn and Wantchekon,2011). In areas more exposed to the African slave trade, Teso(2019) finds long-run persistence and the cultural transmission of women substituting for missing men by taking up traditionally male tasks.====This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the background of cultural division and its relation to industrial location choice in China. Section3 describes the dataset, constructs the key variables, and develops the specification strategy. Section4 reports the main results, followed by an analysis that investigates and quantifies the possible channels by which culture may affect industrial concentration during the process of trade liberalization. Section6 investigates the heterogeneous effect of regions with high and low exposure to trade shocks.

Our analyses at the district and individual levels are based mainly on the data of successful imperial test takers, the 2009 population census, and 2009 National Entrance Exams to University test scores. We find a persistent legacy in educational attainment outcomes. Although there may be multiple channels that explain the long-term historical effects, a tradition of human capital investment and cultural elements are among the most important factors.","Investment in human capital is important for economic development, and many models of economic growth take human capital into account (Goldin, 2019). Although the concept of investing in human capital gained prominence following Mincer (1958) and Schultz (1961), such investment has been practiced for centuries. In other words, the study of human capital is inherently historical (Goldin, 2019). This agrees with Nunn (2021)’s view that explaining differences in economic development requires consideration of historical roots.====However, research on investment in human capital over time is scarce and channels for the intergenerational transmission of human capital remain to be explored. Among the few previous studies, Valencia Caicedo (2019) finds that areas with a former Jesuit missionary presence in Guarani (present-day Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) from 1609 to 1767 still have higher educational attainment in the present day. In addition, Chen et al. (2020) shows that the population density of Chinese imperial elites (1368–1905) is associated with more years of schooling in the present day in 278 Chinese prefectures, indicating that social capital among clans and views on the value of education and schools would form cultural norms and spread outside the educated elite families via social organizations (e.g., charity organizations, farmer associations, labor unions, and religious associations).====Our study on Vietnam attempts to show that the transmission of human capital investment is crucial. This study seeks empirical evidence for whether the intensity of investment in human capital passed from generation to generation in Vietnam. Our analyses are possible because Vietnamese imperial exam records, particularly those recorded on stele stones (==== in Vietnamese), provide a long and uninterrupted historical dataset on the nation's top learners. The contents of the stele stones were copied in early 1900s by the French School of the Far East (==== in French), which would have saved the records from being lost during catastrophic modern wars and conflicts in Vietnam.====Here, we specifically investigate whether an association exists among test takers who passed the 1075–1919 imperial examinations at the national level==== (hereinafter, “imperial elites”) and between imperial elites and the educational achievements of people living in the present-day district that was home to these imperial elites. Our main analysis examines educational outcomes at two levels, namely, the district aggregated level (covering 688 districts) and the individual level (covering about 0.68 million university entrance examination test takers born in 1991). In each district, we consider both the number of imperial elites and the density of imperial elites per square kilometer as an alternative. We apply an instrumental variable (IV) approach for our analysis of both levels.====Our findings indicate a persistent relationship between the success of imperial elites and the quantity and quality of education of subsequent generations. More specifically, we find that the number and density of imperial elites are well connected across dynasties. Both the number and density of imperial elites during 1075–1919 in a given district are associated with a higher school attendance rate in compulsory primary school and twelfth grade, and more average years of schooling in the present day. In contrast, the correlations are negative when primary school dropouts and school non-enrollment are used as the outcomes. From the analysis at the individual level, we find that the number and density of imperial elites in the district led to higher age-standardized test scores (z-scores) in the 2009 National Entrance Exams to University (NEEU). Higher z-scores might also be a reason for a higher school enrollment rate among the district population aged 18–24 years. However, such a legacy might not necessarily be realized in certain clans in these districts. We find that the number of elites in a district is associated with a higher share of the district's average household living expenses reserved for educational purposes. We propose several catalysts for this persistent legacy, including returns on test scores, the strong dependence of wages on academic degrees (especially for university degrees), and the independence of villages from central government control in the present day.====Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, to our knowledge, this paper is the first to examine the transmission of human capital investment and its impacts on present-day education in terms of the education quality, proxied by test scores. Second, we provide empirical evidence for persistence. We find an association across dynasties among the number of imperial elites from the same home district. We also find associations between the number of imperial elites (1075–1919) and present-day investment in education.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the data sources and the integration of the data for analysis in Section 2. Section 3 presents our identification strategy, the construction of the IV, and the methods.

This article investigates how elections affect the perception of political instability of African firms. We use a survey-based dataset of approximately 21,500 firms in 33 African countries which we cross with 237 elections between 2004 and 2020. Our ==== strategy allows a detailed identification of election periods and the associated effects. We provide robust evidence of a pre-election increase in the perception of political instability by firms, but no, or limited post-election effects. The perception of political instability by firms is stronger for firms oriented towards foreign markets, in countries with non-democratic institutions or a high risk of conflict.","Private sector development relies on market opportunities and ease of doing business, but it ultimately depends on the decisions made by investors and firms’ managers, so their perception of the obstacles to their businesses and their opportunities is decisive. Elections are critical periods which can lead to changes in regulations and public policies, as well as to social unrest, which can affect the ways of doing business. As such, elections have the potential to alter the perception of political instability by firms and the behavior of investors and firms’ managers. The relationship between elections and the perception of political instability has received little attention. One exception is Baker et al. (2020) who report a pre-election increase of political uncertainty, as measured by newspaper coverage, for a group of 23 (mostly OECD) countries.==== This article aims to extend our understanding of how firms’ perception of political instability is sensitive to the election cycle, (i) by observing the perception of political instability directly from firms’ managers and (ii) by focusing attention on African countries which have a long history of political crises (Collier, 2011; Flores and Nooruddin, 2012).====The theoretical effect of elections on firms’ perception of political instability in Africa is unclear. Elections are a key component of democracy designed to select by whom, and how, citizens are governed and so facilitate smooth transitions between leaders. In other words, elections are expected to pacify inter-group relationships by creating shared rules to manage latent social and political conflicts. The degree of uncertainty about an election's outcome is small in some African elections, especially when the incumbent leader is standing for re-election. Elections are often a tool for leaders to be re-elected rather than a credible way to bring transition and political change. For instance, in 2020, only one African presidential election (out of 10) resulted in an actual change of leadership.====On the other hand, elections may exacerbate underlying tensions. Elections attract attention, which can cause opponents to coalesce and make their voices heard. In addition, incumbent leaders need to prove that their legitimacy comes from the people. They may be tempted to change the electoral rules, use propaganda tools, or even manipulate the official results.====For instance, the conduct of the elections and/or their results was challenged in almost all the African elections which occurred in 2020,==== and pre and postelection protests are frequent in Africa (Beaulieu, 2014). In the worst cases, elections can lead to political violence (see Collier and Vicente, 2012; Cederman et al., 2013; Flores and Nooruddin, 2012, among others). According to this point of view, elections may increase the perception of political instability not only before an election, but also in the immediate post-election period if the official results are contested by opposition politicians.====The relationship between elections and the perception of political instability needs empirical investigation. As examples, consider the general elections that took place in Namibia in 2014 and Nigeria in 2015. These two elections have some common features such as the participation of the incumbent president (in Nigeria) or his designated successor (in Namibia), and the fact that the electoral process was generally non-violent. However, these elections took place in very different contexts. While the Namibian election was not competitive (the winner won with over 80% of the vote), the Nigerian election was less certain. In the contested Nigerian election, the incumbent ultimately lost. It followed a violent election in 2011 and there were threats to national security (due to attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram), which forced the government to postpone the election. In the run-up to the election, threats of violence remained a concern, although the process ultimately remained peaceful. Data on the perception of political instability, presented in Figure A1 in Appendix, reflect these differences. In Namibia (blue), the level of perceived political instability does not increase as the election day approaches, and decreases just before it. In Nigeria (red), by contrast, firms’ perception of political instability increases before the election and just after it, which may suggest worries about post-election violence. These examples show that the relationship between elections and the perception of political instability may be context-specific.====This paper examines whether the perception of political instability by firms’ managers is shaped by the election cycle. Political instability is a major impediment to firms’ dynamics. As indicated in Fig. 1, political instability is the third biggest obstacle for firms’ operations in developing countries (smaller than access to electricity and corruption but bigger than tax and access to credit). Evidence, from industrialized countries, highlights that political risk and uncertainty, and their perception, influence firms’ behavior and long-term development (Rodrik, 1991; Baker et al., 2016; Hassan et al., 2019, among others). Since business activity results directly from the behavior of investors and firms’ managers, a better understanding of the drivers of the perception of political instability by firms, is therefore of prime interest to spur private sector growth and economic development.====Using micro data of firms’ perception from several countries rather than macro or aggregate measures of political instability allows further investigation of the overall impact of elections on firms’ perception of political instability, in two ways. First, we try to understand which firms are more likely to be affected by the timing of elections, since as shown by Hassan et al. (2019) political risk is heterogeneous across firms. Second, and in line with the examples provided above, we examine which country factors, and which election factors, influence the relationship between the election cycle and firms’ perception of political instability. This allows us to better understand the channels through which elections influence firms’ perception of political instability - in other words how they perceive the uncertainty regarding the future leaders and their policies or the risk of events such as regime change or events of political violence.====To investigate the impact of elections on the perception of political instability, we use firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) and our own data on legislative and executive elections in Africa from 2004 to 2020. We employ both an absolute measure of political instability, and a measure of political instability relative to other perceived obstacles. We use the difference in the dates of interviews of firms, relative to the same election date, to analyze whether election cycles matter.====We find evidence which indicates that firms’ perception of political instability increases in the 6 months before an election. This increase is not only statistically significant, but also economically meaningful. For instance, firms surveyed in the 3 months before an election are 20 percentage points more likely to state that political instability is a major, or very severe, obstacle to their operations (which is 60% higher than the mean). However, there is a decrease in perception of political instability just after elections. We run robustness checks that confirm our main findings.====In the final part of the paper, we scrutinize heterogeneity in the relationship between election calendar and perception of political instability. We first examine which firms are more likely to perceive political instability as an obstacle to their operations. In doing so, we interact 3-month dummies with firms’ characteristics. We find that firms oriented towards foreign markets (foreign-owned firms and exporters) are more sensitive to election cycles, while other characteristics (including size, age, gender and experience of the manager, location, sector) do not matter.====Finally, we consider election and country characteristics. We have two main findings. First, the perception of political instability increases when the electoral process is distorted or when the incumbent leader participates. In many countries, elections are used to legitimize the leader in power ==== the international community. However, elections are also an opportunity for the opposition to make their voices heard. As a result, elections are more likely to generate political instability, or at least to increase managers’ perception of instability, in non-democratic countries than in countries with strong democratic institutions. Second, even if elections take place in peaceful conditions, there is an increase in the perception of political instability. However, elections are more likely to generate an increase in the perception of political instability when the risk of conflict is higher. We find that firms are more sensitive to electoral cycles if their country experienced violent episodes before their interview. We also find that major political shocks in neighboring countries may lead to cross-border spillover effects.====This paper adds to the literature on the impact of political factors on firms. Although a recent body of literature scrutinizes how elections influence firms in industrialized countries (Julio and Yook, 2012, 2016; Jens, 2017), we know little about the implications of election cycles for firms in developing countries. One exception is Léon and Weill (2022) who show that firms’ access to credit is reduced in pre-election and election years in developing countries. The literature has shown that elections affect firms’ sunk cost decisions such as investment, but the relationship with the perception of political instability has not been studied so far, with one notable exception for the United States (Baker et al., 2020). It is ultimately the perception of instability that will shape choices made by investors and managers and therefore affect the future of a given firm. A firm is likely to reduce investment if its decision makers overestimate or are pessimistic about the level of political instability. By focusing on firms’ perception of political instability, we investigate a channel in the relationship between political institutions and business activity. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the perception of political instability for a large range of firms’ operating in Africa. Previous papers focus either on nationwide indicators of perception of political uncertainty (Baker et al., 2016, 2020), or on firms’ sensitivity to political uncertainty for a sample of large and listed firms in industrialized countries (Bia lkowski et al., 2008; Hassan et al., 2019). These approaches are not feasible in Africa due to the lack of credible data. For instance, measures based on newspaper coverage (Baker et al., 2016) are hard to implement without bias in Africa. Local press may be censored and international media may not capture the perception of local populations.==== Our approach has a second advantage. It allows us to exploit firm-level measures of political instability, which is useful given the evidence of big differences across firms (Hassan et al., 2019; Easaw and Grimme, 2021). To our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate firm-level differences in perception of political instability for a sample of non-listed companies operating in developing countries. We show that foreign-market oriented firms are more sensitive to election cycles, while other characteristics do not influence the relationship between the election calendar and the perception of political instability.====This article also contributes to the literature on elections in Africa. A rich body of literature has investigated whether elections spur civil conflicts in Africa (e.g. Collier and Vicente, 2012; Cederman et al., 2013; Flores and Nooruddin, 2012; Taylor et al., 2017, among others). In line with previous works on the relationship between elections and conflicts, we find that elections are more likely to lead to tensions in post-conflict societies and when the incumbent leader stands for re-election. However, we show that elections can influence firms’ perception even when elections do not increase civil violence; elections that do not degenerate can nonetheless influence firms’ decisions. This issue raises concern about the economic consequences of elections in Africa. However, the positive message is that the perception of instability in election cycles is less marked in strong democracies and in peaceful societies.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the nature and sources of data. Section 3 details the methodology we use in the analysis. The results are presented in Section 4 with a heterogeneity analysis in Section 5.

In this paper, we present a body of suggestive evidence highlighting the prevalence of wage underreporting among minimum wage earners. We study two minimum wage hikes implemented in Latvia in 2014 and 2015, and show that minimum wage employees are more likely to survive these minimum wage hikes than employees earning slightly more. This effect is present in the sample of small (more prone to ","Labor markets in transition and post-transition countries are characterized by the prevalence of payroll tax evasion in the form of envelope wages, i.e., non-declared cash coming in addition to the official wage (e.g., Gorodnichenko et al. (2009) and Braguinsky and Mityakov (2015) in Russia, Paulus (2015) and Kukk and Staehr (2014) in Estonia, Putnins and Sauka (2015) in Latvia, Biro et al. (2021) and Elek et al. (2012) in Hungary).====Another defining characteristic of this set of countries is a very large peak at exactly the minimum wage in the wage distribution. To explain this phenomenon, Tonin (2011) argues that the mass of individuals at the minimum wage is composed to a large extent of workers receiving envelope wages: employers and employees collude and agree on reporting only the minimum wage in order to minimize tax liabilities while remaining under the radar of the tax authorities. In this setup, minimum wage policy becomes an enforcement tool for the fiscal administration, as it pushes non-compliant firms to convert part of the envelope wage into an official wage so that it reaches the new minimum wage.====However, only scarce concrete evidence shows that payroll tax evaders are overrepresented among minimum wage earners. Considering the regular minimum wage hikes in the region (e.g., a 69% increase in Latvia in 2010–2020, a 5-fold increase in Ukraine, a 2.6-fold increase in Russia and a twofold increase in Hungary over the same period), understanding the interaction between minimum wage policy and labor tax evasion is crucial.====In this paper, we present a body of suggestive evidence highlighting the prevalence of wage underreporting at ==== the minimum wage. We use Latvian administrative employer–employee data covering the full Latvian employed population at a monthly rate between 2011 and 2015. Our analysis relies on a comparison of (i) labor market outcomes of employees earning exactly the minimum wage against employees earning slightly more and (ii) comparing this difference between employees of small and large firms, as the literature suggests that smaller firms are more likely to engage in payroll tax evasion (see, for example, Kumler et al. (2020) and Kleven et al. (2016)). Ultimately, this results in a triple-difference design.====Our analysis proceeds in three steps. In the first step, we exploit a series of two minimum wage hikes implemented in Latvia in 2014 and 2015 to study the probability of an employee remaining in the same job over time. Standard labor market models predict that low-productivity jobs are the first to disappear following a minimum wage hike. If the wage distribution reflects productivity, we should observe a higher probability of an employee earning exactly the minimum wage losing their job compared to an employee earning slightly more. On the other hand, if minimum wage employees are more likely to receive envelope wages, underreporting can act as a shock absorber. In this case, minimum wage workers should on average have a higher probability of having kept their jobs. We show that this is indeed the case: in small firms, minimum wage workers are more likely to retain their jobs compared to workers earning slightly more.==== In large firms, which we assume do not evade or evade less, minimum wage workers are less likely to keep their jobs after a hike. We argue that the observed response is consistent with tax evaders being overrepresented among minimum wage earners, and is hard to rationalize otherwise.====In the second step, we use a similar setup to analyze switches from full-time to part-time work within the same firm. There is evidence showing that some firms in Latvia use the practice of underreporting hours worked to reduce their tax obligations. In such cases, employers conclude part-time contracts with employees, while in fact, workers work full time (European Commission, 2017). This evidence is consistent with the fact that in Latvia the spike in the wage distribution is observed not only around the minimum wage, but also around half of the minimum wage. We assume that firms engaged in wage underreporting are also more likely to misreport hours of work and hence can use reduced reported hours as an adjustment mechanism to minimum wage shocks. Our results confirm that minimum wage employees in small firms are more likely to switch to part-time work than employees earning slightly more. However, we find that this effect is mostly driven by older employees, which can imply that what we capture are the true switches to part-time work among employees with weaker attachment to the labor market. Therefore, we interpret our findings on switches to part-time employment as a mechanism of tax evasion with some caution.====Finally, in the third step, we exploit a period with no minimum wage changes and analyze individuals who changed employers during this period and switched from a small to a big firm or vice versa. We show that employees earning exactly the minimum wage have a significantly larger wage gain when switching from a small to a large firm, compared to employees earning slightly more than the minimum wage, while no such effect applies to minimum wage employees initially working in big firms. We interpret this as additional evidence that minimum wage earners are more likely to receive part of their income in cash than other employees.====Latvia is a good case to examine the prevalence of envelope wages among minimum wage workers. First, considerable evidence suggests that envelope wages are a major issue in the Latvian labor market. More than one in ten employees in Latvia admitted to having received envelope wages, which is the highest share in the EU (European Commission, 2014). Putnins and Sauka (2015) estimate that 34% of total wages in the Latvian private sector were paid in envelopes in 2009. Second, the share of minimum wage workers is very high. In 2011, more than 10% of full-time jobs in the private sector and more than 30% of full-time jobs in small private firms (with less than 10 workers) were paid exactly the minimum wage. Third, completely unreported employment is not widespread. Only 2% of respondents in Latvia said that they were employed without a formal written contract (European Commission, 2014). Hazans (2012) finds that the share of employees having worked without a formal contract in Latvia in 2010 was 3.4%–3.5%.====Several policy implications are derived from our findings. Insofar as evading minimum wage workers survive minimum wage hikes, the minimum wage policy represents an effective tax enforcement tool in countries where wage underreporting is an issue. Our results also provide a rationale for the fiscal authorities to specifically target tax audits to focus on firms with a large share of minimum wage workers. The positive fiscal effect, however, comes at the expense of possible employment losses in tax compliant firms employing low-wage workers and closures of such firms. Our results suggest that payroll tax evasion is ==== prevalent among minimum wage earners, but by no means point to an absence of evasion in the rest of the wage distribution.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Using population censuses and data we collected on the adoption of the hukou reform, we find that improved access to hukou substantially increases migration. The impact is more pronounced for young and low- and medium-skilled workers. Moreover, the impact persists over the long term. The policy positively affects local labor market probably through increased domestic consumption from migrants who (are prepared to) obtain local hukou in destinations. These findings demonstrate the importance of lifting barriers to local citizenship for internal migration in China. Underlying mechanisms and competing hypotheses are also analyzed.","Several studies have analyzed how granting citizenship to immigrants affects acquisition of local language and social interactions with natives (Avitabile, Clots-Figueras, and Masella 2013), human capital investments and labor supply (Gathmann and Keller 2018), cooperativeness toward natives (Felfe et al. 2021), children's educational outcomes (Felfe, Rainer, and Saurer 2020), as well as fertility and children's health and social-emotional outcomes (Avitabile, Clots-Figueras, and Masella 2014). Overall, they find that granting citizenship to immigrants is a powerful policy instrument to boost economic integration in developed countries with traditionally restrictive citizenship policies. However, the economic effects of granting local citizenship to internal migrants are largely understudied.==== Many internal migrants in developing countries, unlike their counterparts in developed countries, are still denied access to local citizenship (e.g., the status of being local residents with ==== in the context of China).==== Further analyzing the consequences of granting local citizenship to internal migrants is thereby important, particularly for developing countries.====In this article, we investigate the economic effects of lifting barriers to local citizenship in the context of a large-scale internal migration in China that has changed the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people over the past four decades. In particular, we examine the extent and how improved access to local citizenship in destinations affect migration decisions of people from rural areas, who dominate internal migration in China, and the resulting labor market consequences in destinations over time.====To estimate the causal effects of lifting barriers to local citizenship, this study exploits quasi-experimental, city-level variations in the timing and intensity of exposure to a ==== reform in China. The ==== reform made it easier for migrants from rural areas to obtain local ==== in destinations. ====, which is similar to a badge of citizenship in Western society, is a form of registration that determines a person's entitlements, including the right to work, education, and social security (Solinger 1999; Chan and Zhang 1999).==== Migrants living in destinations without local ==== are deprived of the many perquisites of being employed in the local public sector (e.g., state-owned enterprises), denied free compulsory education, and typically could not receive free health care and pension. The ==== reform substitutes a rigid annual quota system with a de jure quota-free system that entails some basic entry requirements for local ==== application.==== Unlike the previous rigid annual quota system, the new system neither restricts the total number of people who can obtain local ==== in destinations de jure nor sets age and education (skill) limits for the application of local ====.==== The distinctive nature of this ==== reform allows examining the causal effects of improved access to ==== in destinations.====The Chinese ==== system is an internal passport system used to control internal migration, particularly rural-urban migration, and was formally established by Chinese authorities in 1958. Under the initial system, Chinese people received local ==== registrations in their places of birth and were not allowed to migrate away from their registered places without official permits.==== Beginning in the early 1980s, the government slowly relaxed labor migration, allowing people to work temporarily in other places without registration. However, unregistered migrants continued to be denied access to local citizenship unless they successfully obtained local ====, access to which remained strictly controlled under an annual quota system. Consequently, the ==== system delinked labor migration from access to local citizenship in destinations. Since the late 1990s, the government steadily adopted reforms to relax the ==== system, making it easier for migrants to obtain local ==== in destinations. This situation provides a unique case to study the consequences of improved access to ==== on internal migration.====Substantial literature has studied the determinants of migration decisions, finding that income prospects, financial constraints, social networks, risk sharing, and welfare benefits are all important factors in such decisions (Kennan and Walker 2011; Angelucci 2015; Munshi and Rosenzweig 2016; Morten 2019; Agersnap, Jensen, and Kleven 2020). However, the extent and how barriers to (local) citizenship affect migration decisions remain unclear. Although several studies have investigated international migration in the citizenship context, whether or not these studies reveal a causal relationship remains an open question (Fitzgerald, Leblang, and Teets 2014; Leblang 2017; Alarian and Goodman 2017; Agersnap, Jensen, and Kleven 2020). Moreover, research on internal migration in the context is rare, regardless of the fact that many internal migrants continue to be denied access to local citizenship in developing countries such as India, Vietnam, and China. Investigating the research question in the context of internal migration offers at least two advantages. First, it alleviates the identification concerns caused by unobservable factors in international migration. Second, it reduces the concern that region-specific characteristics (e.g., political systems, religion) in destinations dominate citizenship in determining migration decisions. Indeed, the causally interpretable evidence on the impact of lifting barriers to local citizenship on internal migration is scarce, given that the availability of such evidence is largely constrained by a lack of comparable data on relevant acquisition of local citizenship in different localities. Accordingly, we generally cannot rule out the possibility that internal migration, particularly in developing countries, is driven by other factors (e.g., income prospects, business cycle fluctuations, and trade liberalization) that have little to do with barriers to local citizenship in destinations.====The present study addresses this gap in the literature by using a quasi-experimental ==== reform across 283 Chinese cities. The empirical strategy exploits a difference-in-differences (DID) framework on the basis of comparisons between the cities exposed to the ==== reform at different times and with different requirements. The identifying assumptions are as follows. First, the decision about whether, to what extent, and when to adopt the ==== reform is uncorrelated with any prior trends in the outcomes of interest. Second, the timing and intensity of exposure to the ==== reform do not coincide with any city-specific shocks or policies that might influence the outcomes of interest.====In support of the first assumption, we test whether any treatment effects exist in the pretreatment periods to confirm the validity of the DID setup. In particular, we use an estimator proposed by de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2020) to cope with the concern that a two-way fixed effects model may not work well when heterogeneous treatment effects exist (e.g., by groups or over time). We also control for the effects of covariates using two approaches. As for the second assumption, we conduct permutation tests to confirm that the main results are not driven by the timing pattern of the ==== reform. We also control for several confounding policies that vary across cities to confirm that they do not contaminate the main results. We focus on three important city-level policies that may directly affect internal migration in China: (a) reductions in trade policy uncertainty (on exporting goods to the United States) after China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001; (b) increases in minimum wages in urban areas; and (c) the abolition of agricultural taxes in rural areas. Finally, we conduct two additional placebo analyses by focusing on individuals less affected by the ==== reform and by analyzing alternative census data reflecting a period prior to the adoption of the ==== reform.====This study reports four main findings. First, improved access to ==== in destinations substantially increases migration from rural areas, suggesting that barriers to local citizenship in destinations are indeed an important obstacle deterring internal migration in a developing country such as China. Second, the impact is more pronounced for young and low- and medium-skilled people, suggesting that these groups are more sensitive to barriers to local citizenship in destinations. Third, increased return to migration through higher expected benefits attached to obtaining local citizenship in destinations is a likely underlying mechanism though which improved access to ==== facilitates migration. All of these findings demonstrate the importance of lifting barriers to local citizenship for internal migration in China. Lastly, the same policy positively affects the local labor market possibly through increased domestic consumption from migrants who (are prepared to) obtain local ==== in destinations. All of these empirical findings are in line with the implications derived in Section 2.====This article makes two additional contributions to the literature. First, it joins an emerging literature on the economic effects of lifting barriers to (local) citizenship, either within- or between-countries. In particular, our finding demonstrates the importance of lifting barriers to local citizenship for boosting economic integration in China, which sheds light on the consequences of barriers to local citizenship in other developing countries such as India (Weiner 1978; Abbas 2016; Bhagat and Kumar 2021) and Vietnam (Anh 2003; Vo 2020). Our finding also complements previous studies that gauge the effectiveness of lifting barriers to citizenship for economic integration in developed countries (Avitabile, Clots-Figueras, and Masella 2013; 2014; Gathmann and Keller 2018; Felfe, Rainer, and Saurer 2020; Felfe et al. 2021).====Second, it sheds light on the labor market consequences of relaxing China's ==== system. Notably, previous findings are mostly based on theoretical and simulation-based analysis (Whalley and Zhang 2007; Bosker et al. 2012; Tombe and Zhu 2019; Sieg, Yoon, and Zhang 2020) rather than real-world policies. Among a few empirical studies using real-world policies to estimate the impact of relaxing the ==== system on migration decisions, results vary significantly owing to differences in measures of relaxing the ==== system and corresponding identification strategies (Sun, Bai, and Xie 2011; Fan 2019). Unlike previous measures that either rely on provincial-level variations in the timing of relaxing the ==== system (Sun, Bai, and Xie 2011; Song and Li 2014; Kinnan, Wang, and Wang 2018) or city-level variations in the on-paper entry requirements of obtaining local ==== (Fan 2019; Zhang, Wang, and Lu 2019), we manually construct a new data set determining variations in the timing of relaxing the ==== system across 283 Chinese cities from 2002 to 2015. A combination of the newly constructed measure and traditional measure of on-paper entry requirements enables us to investigate the impact of an important and understudied aspect of the ==== system (i.e., quota restrictions) on internal migration. In addition to estimating the causal impact of relaxing the ==== system on migration decisions, the newly constructed measure is useful for investigating other consequences of an active labor market policy in a developing country, including local labor market outcomes, productivity, and technology adoption (Clemens, Lewis, and Postel 2018).",Access to local citizenship and internal migration in a developing country: Evidence from a Hukou reform in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000610,6 September 2022,2022,Research Article,40.0

The paper examines the impact of kinship networks on firm performance and growth based on our original survey of 1000 firm owners in the Central Asian Republic of Kyrgyzstan. We obtained detailed information on respondents’ business networks, resources they both receive from (in-networks) and provide to their kin and other contacts (out-networks) and their firm's performance. Our results indicate that in-networks raise profitability, out-networks reduce it, and these two forms of network usage are positively, but far from perfectly, correlated. We also show that kin-reliant firms grow slower than firms with access to non-kin assistance but faster than firms that do not have access to any business networks at all. We find evidence that one mechanism of slower growth is lower levels of reinvestment. We conclude that accounting for in- and out-networks helps to resolve the ambiguous message from the broader empirical literature regarding the effect of kin networks on firm performance: the two forms of network use are positively correlated, most likely due to generalized reciprocity within kin networks, yet have opposite effects.","The kinship ties of entrepreneurs can have both positive and negative effects on firm performance and growth in developing economies. Kinship networks serve as a basis for relational exchange outside of or together with market exchange. Relational exchange can complicate contract enforcement due to solidarity considerations, divert profits from investment toward redistribution, and encourage favoritism (Baland et al., 2011; Fafchamps, 2004; Grimm et al., 2013; Platteau, 2000). Heavy kin reliance can thus produce misallocated resources, inefficiency, and even a poverty trap (Kranton, 1996; Hoff and Sen, 2006; Platteau, 2009). However, absent well-functioning markets and institutions, kinship networks can solve information and enforcement problems, supply asset equity, credit, or working capital, transmit beliefs that promote modernization and facilitate collective action to improve the business climate (Greif, 1993; Munshi, 2011; Khayesi et al., 2014; Ismailbekova, 2017), thereby helping entrepreneurs overcome challenging business environments and fostering economic growth.====Any given entrepreneur may experience positive and negative or both types of effects simultaneously at different points in their firm's lifecycle. The structure of a firm owner's kin relations tends to remain fairly fixed over time, despite some variations due to births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. However, a hypothetical owner with a temporally constant structure of kin relations may receive and provide different forms of assistance – that is, activate different kinship ties for different business purposes – at different times, and even at the same time. Consequently, empirical research using a fixed measure of kinship networks may mistakenly interpret the net effect. For example, an overall negative effect may reflect a preponderance of entrepreneurs activating their networks for the purposes of redistribution. If these same entrepreneurs had in the past activated their network for assistance, such as for startup financing, and the redistribution today represents only a tiny fraction of the value-added of the kinship network, then the estimated negative effect would be highly misleading. Without an empirical strategy that precisely distinguishes different forms of network activation, researchers may not properly measure the true impact of kinship networks using cross-sectional data (the type of data that is typically available for firms as well as networks) and fail to understand how to leverage kinship ties for growth.====To address these issues empirically, we measure both types of network activation, those associated with positive and those with negative effects using original survey data from Kyrgyzstan. Our survey of 1000 business owners in Kyrgyzstan's two largest cities, Bishkek and Osh, allows us to distinguish networks ==== a firm receives business assistance (====) from those ==== it provides assistance (====). While conceptually distinct, the two networks overlap, but not perfectly. We capture both business networks while economizing on respondents’ cognitive effort. We ask how many times in recent years they received each of four specific types of business assistance from others in each of four types of relationship categories (relatives, friends, clan members, and others), as well as parallel questions for five specific types of assistance they provided to people in the same four relationship categories. We treat each such instance of help received or provided as either an in – or out-connection, the sum of which (respectively) constitutes the in- and out-networks. We also ask about ==== sources of help to obtain a measure of kin reliance that does not depend on their activation.====With these data, we first estimate the simultaneous effects of in- and out-networks on firm profitability. Next, we examine how the rates at which entrepreneurs receive and provide help from/to kin and the expected effects of each such instance on firm profitability vary by firm age, an important factor in the efficient use of generalized reciprocity – where assistance given and received constitutes a multilateral transaction across a connected group of individuals – by kin networks. Third, to assess the implications for economic growth, we take a longer view and estimate the effect of relative reliance on kin (versus non-kin) networks for impact on revenue growth of the firm since its inception. Finally, we examine whether kin reliance limits firm growth by reducing reinvestment of the firm's profits.====To address concerns about the endogeneity of network usage, we employ instrumental variables (IV) estimation, resting on two identification assumptions: (i) the number of owner's cousins and its square differentially affect in- and out-connections, (ii) the number of owner's cousins only influences firm performance through the number of kin connections, net of our controls for firm and owner characteristics. Standard tests confirm the first assumption. The second is not testable, so we include additional controls for variables that proxy omitted factors, such as parental education or entrepreneurial culture that might jointly influence network usage and profitability. Additionally, we take advantage of the retrospective panel data when estimating regressions for revenue growth by using fixed effects to account for unobserved individual heterogeneity.====Our regression models for profitability yield opposite-signed effects of kin in- and out-network activation, that together explain up to one third of a standard deviation in profit margin. Although IV estimates are larger and less precisely estimated than the OLS estimates, they yield similar results, and they are stable to the inclusion of extensive set of covariate controls. When we add interactions of firm age with network usage to the model to test, we find results consistent with the expectation that providing help to out-networks is more costly for older firms. Moreover, firms with potential in-networks grow faster than those without, but new firms with kin-dominated in-networks grow slower than those that report a more balanced mix of kin and non-kin in their potential in-network. Firms with heavier reliance on kin ties might keep cash on hand (and thus underinvest profits) to reciprocate past assistance received or contribute to a kin insurance network. In fact, both actual in-network and out-network kin connections are negatively associated with reinvestment of profits. These results survive a variety of sensitivity analyses that we performed to address possibly skewed error distribution due to systematic over- or underreporting in the dependent variable (Millimet and Parmeter, 2022), selection bias due to missing data, survivor bias, and other types of heterogeneity that we can address econometrically.====Taken together, our findings highlight the temporal dynamics of in- and out-network usage: reciprocal obligations from both in-network usage and firm performance should predict the nature of out-network usage over time, and both the timing and the magnitude of these interlinkages determine whether kinship networks ultimately promote or thwart economic growth. Moreover, studies that use a single measure of kin network influence (e.g., the number of siblings) risk conflating opposite-signed network effects that may apply simultaneously to a specific firm, inevitably producing mixed results across studies reflecting whichever type of network (in- or out-) predominates in the particular data. Reflecting the ambiguity of the theoretical predictions, empirical studies in the United States, Europe, and Sub-Saharan Africa have reported positive (Alsosa et al., 2014; Chipika and Wilson, 2006; Khayesi et al., 2014), null (Miller et al., 2009), negative (Fafchamps and Minten, 2002; Bertrand et al., 2008; Acquaah, 2012; Grimm et al., 2013; Gassie-Falzone, 2016; Nguyen and Nordman, 2018), and mixed (Anderson and Reeb, 2003; Kowalewski et al., 2010; Berrou and Combarnous, 2012; Grimm et al., 2017) effects of (specifically) kin network usage on firm performance.====Our results also contribute to the empirical literature on the effects of kinship on business performance by showcasing an understudied region. Kyrgyzstan is an interesting context in which to study this problem due to its intermediate position in the strength of kinship relations and level of economic development vis-à-vis other cases previously studied in the literature (See the discussion in Section 3). Of particular relevance for comparative analysis is our suggestive evidence that generalized reciprocity extends to business networks. Thus, separately measuring in- and out-networks should generate useful theoretical insights by enabling a more complete view of the effects of kinship across levels of development.====In the next section, we discuss the national context of our study. Section 3 considers prior literature on the effects of kinship networks on business performance and formulates hypotheses. Section 4 describes our survey. Section 5 discusses our estimation strategy. Section 6 presents the results and summarizes the sensitivity analyses that appear in the appendix.

The elites can, however, incentivize investment by granting to the nonelites strong property rights to the input and a more inclusive political process, which entrusts them with control over fiscal policies. Adverse production conditions force the elites to enact strong nonelites’ political and property rights to convince them that a sufficient part of the returns on joint investments will be shared via public good provision. These reforms assure cooperation. When, instead, the expected investment return is large, the elites keep control over fiscal policies but refrain from weakening the nonelites’ property rights, while strengthening their own, if the production conditions are sufficiently opaque. Then, the expected cost of providing the extra public good guaranteeing the nonelites’ participation is too large. These predictions are consistent with novel data on 44 major Mesopotamian polities observed for each half-century from 3050 to 1750 BCE. While a lower growing season temperature favored a larger division of the decision-making power and stronger farmers’ use rights to land, only the latter are related to the diffusion of the very opaque viticulture. In addition, only the inclusiveness of the political process fostered the provision of public and ritual buildings as well as conscripted ====. Crucially, our results are robust to considering the trade potential, the severity of conflicts, and the degree of urbanization.","Overwhelming evidence suggests that strong nonelites’ political and property rights are the state institutions most relevant for long run economic development and that they are correlated with each other (Besley and Persson, 2009). Documenting, however, that these two institutional arrangements are economically meaningful and reinforce each other does not help detect the forces producing each and identify their interaction (Guerriero, 2020, Guerriero, 2021). To contribute to filling this gap in the literature, we build on the two most influential strands of theoretical research on state-building, and we construct a “time inconsistency” model of endogenous political and property rights incorporating the main intuition of the “appropriability” theory of state formation (Boranbay and Guerriero, 2019, Guerriero, 2021, Mayshar et al., 2017). We test the implications of our model on novel data on the first stable state institutions recorded in Greater Mesopotamia during the Bronze Age.====Initially characterized by states of nature lacking institutionalized decision-makers, protection of property rights, and public good provision, Greater Mesopotamia witnessed five key institutional discontinuities. First, the droughts – i.e., cold and dry spans [Weiss, 2017, p. 94] – of the urban revolution period (3800-3300 BCE) magnified consumption risk and the value of irrigation infrastructures, pushing the traditional landholding groups to give up their exclusive control over resources and empower priestly figures who, due to their religious leadership, possessed precious organizational skills. Exploiting this new role, the temples gained, during the proto-states period (3300-3100 BCE), the control over public good provision. Second, the severe drying up of the city-states period (3100-2550 BCE) further reduced the farming returns, forcing the temples to share their power with rising palatial ranks, who succeeded in involving a larger population share in farming by offering tenure-for-service agreements in exchange for the participation in stable armies. The conscripted workers gained several key risk-sharing activities. Third, the kingdoms period (2550-2350 BCE) witnessed a milder climate, which curbed the palace’s need to share its power with the temple. Fourth, an extended period of harsh climate and the consequent expansion of long-distance trade as an alternative economic activity encouraged, during the empires period (2350-1750 BCE), the religious and palatial elites of the polities, who anticipated the largest payoff from cooperating in trade, to involve merchant guilds in policy making. Finally, during all five periods, adverse climate shocks and the diffusion of the very opaque viticulture were accompanied by the rise of strong farmers’ rights to land.====To elucidate the incentives behind these events, we study the possible cooperation between an “elite” and a “nonelite” in a joint investment, e.g., either a farming project or a long distance trade.==== Without loss of generality, we focus on a farming activity, and we assume that it delivers a valuable harvest only if the nonelite embraces a costly and unobservable investment and the imperfectly observable farming conditions are “favorable”, e.g., the temperature is suitable. An exogenous factor that might limit the observability of the farming conditions is the random diffusion of a crop whose domestication is opaque (Fleck and Hanssen, 2006), e.g., grapevine. The elite keeps the untaxed output and cannot commit to direct transfers and, thus, always assure the nonelite’s participation. She can, however, lean on two other instruments. First, she can grant the nonelite a more inclusive political process, which allows him to select the tax rate and organize public good provision. Second, she can punish the nonelite for suspected shirking by weakening his use rights to land, e.g., by evicting him. By weakening the nonelite’s property rights, the elite strengthens her own use rights to land (Guerriero, 2021). When the expected investment return is small, the nonelite cooperates only when his property rights are strong and under the more inclusive political institution, which allows him to fully tax the output and produce his preferred public good. When the expected investment return is intermediate, the elite keeps control over fiscal policies and can implement partial taxation. However, the nonelite’s property rights must be strong to assure participation. This is because his individual rationality constraint is more stringent than his incentive compatibility constraint and, thus, punishment cannot be used as an enforcement mechanism to decrease taxation. When the investment return is large, however, the elite can also weaken the nonelite’s property rights when her expected cost of providing the extra public good needed to guarantee his participation is more than compensated by her expected payoff from stronger use rights. This is more often the case when the farming conditions are more observable, and thus, the expected value of the nonelite’s compensation is small. Our model entails three implications. First, the strength of the nonelite’s political and property rights must be higher the smaller is the expected farming return and, thus, the more severe are the time inconsistency issues faced by an elite lacking commitment. Second, only the legal protection of the nonelite’s property is related – and in a positive manner – to the opacity of farming. Finally, only the inclusiveness of the political process shapes – and in a positive way – the nonelite’s expected utility.====We assess the model implications by analyzing a panel of 44 major Mesopotamian polities, spanning each half-century from 3050 to 1750 BCE. To proxy the expected farming return, we rely on the growing season temperature averaged over a 30 km radius around the coordinates of the city around which a polity evolved and, as any other non-institutional variable, over the previous half-century. The maximum distance between the cultivated fields and the settled center was 30 km. Judging from paleobotanical and extra statistical evidence, our proxy is the most suited to capture the geographic factors easing the domestication of the most diffused crops. Accordingly, it is strongly and significantly correlated with the coeval cereals yields in liters per hectare conditional on half-century fixed effects, the extent of rainfall, and our proxy for the opacity of farming. Turning to the latter, we consider the exogenous spread of viticulture. Being wine very costly to trade but greatly appreciated by the elites, the domesticated grapevine spread through inter-elite noncommercial exchanges of living vines and horticultural expertise among neighboring polities increasingly distant from its native habitat. Regarding the nonelites’ expected utility, we closely follow the model assumption that they only enjoyed public good consumption, and we gather information on the number of public and ritual buildings and the presence of a conscripted army. While the former eased both the organization of economic activities and the elites’ propaganda, the latter was a key risk-sharing mechanism for the nonelites and, arguably, their preferred public good (see also Ticchi and Vindigni (2008)). To construct these and the remaining variables, we build on historical analyses of the single periods and polity-specific secondary sources informed by either land or trade contracts and/or royal inscriptions. Turning to the inclusiveness of the political process and the strength of the farmers’ property rights, we build on the events in a 40-year window around each time period. We proxy the former with a five-point score rising with the division of the decision-making power and the latter with a six-point index increasing when the land exploitation by the elites was indirect – and, thus, the nonelites’ land tenure was longer – rather than direct and/or when entitlements were enforced ==== rather than ====. Since both variables are rule-based rather than subjectively coded, there is no arbitrariness in our measurement of institutions.====Conditional on polity and half-century fixed effects, OLS estimates imply that a lower growing season temperature favored both a larger division of the decision-making power and stronger farmers’ use rights to land, whereas only the latter are related—and in a positive manner—to the diffusion of viticulture. Finally, public good provision is disconnected from the protection of the farmers’ property but significantly and positively linked to the inclusiveness of the political process and, more so, when the common good is the organization of a conscripted army. Even if these results are consistent with the model predictions, they might be attenuated by measurement errors or they may be capturing reverse causality and/or unobserved heterogeneity. We evaluate these issues in three steps.====First, we obtain similar results when we deal with measurement error by either considering alternative proxies for the expected farming return and institutions or treating the nonelites’ rights as ordinal. To perform this last check, we study institutional formation using either fixed effects ordered Logit models or fixed effect Logit models with dependent variables dummies equal to one when some form of protection of either the nonelites’ political or property rights existed. We assess the impact of these dummies on public good provision using OLS fixed effects models. Second, the independence from human effort and institutional decisions of the proxies for the expected return on farming and its opacity excludes reverse causation in our analysis of institutional formation, whereas the fact that the supply of public goods is unrelated to future institutions is inconsistent with public good provision driving coeval nonelites’ rights. Finally, we follow a two-step strategy to assess the role of unobserved heterogeneity. First, we control for the other determinants of institutions and public good provision identified by the extant literature, i.e., expected return on long distance trades (Acemoglu et al., 2005, Barjamovic et al., 2019), environmental circumscription (Mayoral and Olsson, 2019), severity of external and internal conflicts (Besley and Persson, 2009, Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000, Chaney, 2013), and urbanization (Inglehart and Welzel, 2005). Considering these observables either step-wise or together leaves our results almost intact. We reach similar conclusions when we also evaluate the extent of rainfall and severity of climate volatility (Boranbay and Guerriero, 2019), strength of political and property rights prevailing in neighboring polities (Fleck and Hanssen, 2013), presence of merchant institutions (Greif, 1992), political instability driven by the ascent to the throne of a young king (Cassidy et al., 2015), irrigation potential (Bentzen et al., 2016) and great rivers’ avulsion (Heldring et al., 2020). Second, we calculate how much greater the influence of unobservables, relative to that of all the observables considered in the main specifications, would need to be to explain away the links among geography, institutions and public good provision. We find that it would have to be on average more than eleven times greater than the influence of all observables, which seems unlikely. Ultimately, these robustness checks make it difficult to envision that our estimates are driven by mechanisms different from those we model. Hence, we take our results as consistent with, if not proving, causality running from geography to the nonelites’ rights and from the latter to public good provision.====Our paper is closely related to four strands of the vast literature on the formation and evolution of the state. First, we provide a formal framework to think about the link between geography and state formation in ancient societies emphasized by a long historical tradition (Wittfogel, 1957, Adams, 1981, Nissen, 1988, Hole, 1994, Kennett and Kennett, 2006, Staubwasser and Weiss, 2006), debunking, moreover, the conjectures that these early states emerged as a result of the production of food surplus (Smith, 1978, Childe, 1936) and that they relied solely on coercion (see also Blanton and Fargher (2016)). Second, we share with North and Weingast (1989), Barzel and Kiser (1991) and Myerson (2008) the idea that time inconsistency issues created by the elites’ inability to commit to direct transfers and, thus, always assure the nonelites’ participation are key determinants of democratization.==== Unlike these contributions and similar to Boranbay and Guerriero (2019),==== we highlight that public good provision is the main commitment device in the elites’ hands, documenting its empirical relevance for the first time. While doing so, we also provide a formal justification for the empirical regularity that democratization episodes tend to be preceded by a temporary dip in income (Acemoglu et al., 2019). Third, we incorporate into our model the Mayshar et al.’s (2017) and Ahmed and Stasavage’s (2020) intuition that the elites’ inability to elicit cooperation in an opaque activity could force them to grant strong nonelites’ political and property rights.==== In contrast to these papers, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that punishment cannot be used as an enforcement mechanism and, thus, the opacity of the production process is unrelated to the inclusiveness of political institutions and is linked to nonelites’ property rights only when the elites prefer to exchange more taxation for stronger use rights. The key theoretical dimension justifying these differences is that the appropriability literature overlooks the relevance of the elites’ time inconsistency by assuming that they can always garner the nonelites’ participation by committing to direct transfers. From an empirical point of view, instead, the appropriability literature differs from our approach because it focuses on hierarchy and statehood rather than the strength of the nonelites’ political and property rights, does not observe panel variation on ancient societies and does not exploit historical climate changes. Finally, we also compare the explanatory power of our framework with that of the “circumscription” and “conflict” theories (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000, Acemoglu et al., 2005, Boix, 2015, Chaney, 2013).====Our analysis delivers three key contributions. First, we stress the primacy of time inconsistency issues as determinants of institutions. Second, we confirm the model predictions by gathering novel data on the best recorded ancient society.==== Unlike similar databases on medieval and modern societies (Guerriero, 2020), our data set displays large variation across time and space on economies sufficiently simple to credibly link geography to institutions, it includes polities demarcated by well-defined, narrow, and stable boundaries, it gathers detailed information on public goods, and it is unaffected by the European colonization. These innovations draw the attention of economists to ancient societies and the attention of archaeologists and historians to institutional economics. By allowing these scholars to cooperate, not only will similar projects produce otherwise unfeasible data, but they will also deliver deeper theoretical and policy insights (Benati and Guerriero, 2022b, Benati and Guerriero, 2022c). Finally, by showing that fiscal policies link time inconsistency issues to the political order, we identify an understudied determinant of the state’s fiscal capacity (Guerriero and Righi, 2022).====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we review several historical facts about Bronze Age Mesopotamia consonant with the three key implications of the theoretical framework that we illustrate in Section 3. Next, we state the model testable predictions in Section 4, and we discuss our empirical test in Section 5. Finally, we conclude in Section 6, and we report figures and tables (data construction and extra tables) in the (Internet) appendix.",The origins of political institutions and property rights,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000464,2 August 2022,2022,Research Article,47.0

These results challenge existing theories of the political economy of development. Whereas the “Pillars of Prosperity” theory suggests that successful states simultaneously develop protection of property rights and fiscal capacity, my results show that perfect property rights protection can actually undermine the state’s ability to tax.","The ability of the state to collect taxes (fiscal capacity) is an important determinant of economic development (Dincecco and Prado, 2012), technological progress (Acemoglu et al., 2016), and redistribution (Scheve and Stasavage, 2010) and is one of the plausible preconditions for democracy and accountability (Fortin, 2012, Gottlieb and Hollenbach, 2018). While many rich states rely mostly on individual taxes to fund their policies and infrastructural projects, many poor and middle-income countries depend on corporate taxes. Thus, one of the biggest threats to fiscal capacity in many countries is corporate tax avoidance through tax havens (Palan et al., 2013). According to the most reliable recent calculations, 40 percent of multinational corporations engage in tax avoidance leading to an annual loss of 10 percent of global taxes (Tørsløv et al., 2018). This tax avoidance robs states of revenue and damages their ability to provide public goods and services.====One of the puzzling aspects of corporate tax avoidance is its within-country variation: Some firms are more aggressive in shifting their profits than others (Dyreng et al., 2008). Better understanding of the reasons behind firms’ tax avoidance is necessary to help poor and middle-income states build fiscal capacity, maintain order, and implement effective policies. In this paper, I explain this variation by looking at companies’ vulnerability to expropriation. I argue – both theoretically and empirically – that firms that are more vulnerable (due, for example, to having more fixed assets in the country), will comply more fully.====My theory is inspired by Charles Tilly’s famous assertion that the state operates as a protection racket (Tilly, 1985). I start with the assumption that when deciding whether to expropriate a firm or not, the government assesses the costs and benefits. The cost is the value of the assets expropriated; the benefit is the stream of tax revenue foregone if the firm becomes less productive after expropriation. It follows immediately that, if firms pay higher taxes, the benefit from expropriating them will be lower. Understanding this, companies are motivated to pay a higher proportion of the taxes due as a way to shield themselves from expropriation.====Using a formal model, I derive the main testable implication of my theory: a firm’s tax avoidance should correlate negatively with the concentration of its assets in a particular country. In other words, if a firm has more assets in a single country or in a small number of countries, it has more to lose from expropriation and, thus, should be less likely to avoid taxes.====I explore the empirical implication of this theory using a proprietary Orbis data set that contains a registry-based cross-section of firms, as of the year 2014, from 77 countries and 699 four-digit industry codes. These data allow me to control for a variety of firm-level covariates (total assets, total revenue, industry, and number of foreign subsidiaries). Most importantly, the data set contains an identifier of the ultimate parent firm in the multinational corporate structure. This allows me to observe whether two firms in different countries belong to one ultimate parent, and, specifically, whether a firm has a subsidiary in a tax haven.====To test the theory, I estimate a firm-level linear probability model, where an indicator for the presence of a tax-haven affiliate is the dependent variable and the concentration of fixed assets is the main explanatory variable.==== I control for the number of multinational subsidiaries, the total size of assets and the revenue of the firm. I also allow for country- and sector-specific intercepts. I also estimate a set of firm-level panel specifications to rule out confounding factors that are set on the level of firm and remain constant through time. I demonstrate that my results remain substantively similar when I use a two-way within-estimator (adjusting for firm-level and year fixed effects) with tax-to-revenue ratio as a dependent variable.====Because neither the concentration of fixed assets nor the presence of a tax-haven subsidiary is randomly assigned, my statistical procedure relies on the “selection on observables” assumption. To alleviate additional threats to validity, I explore a set of alternative explanations. First, I look into the issue of reverse causality: higher tax avoidance leads to lower fixed-assets concentration because of higher after-tax profits. I control for global after-tax profits and find that my results still hold. Second, if each country sets different tax rates for different sectors and those tax rates correlate with tax avoidance and with fixed-assets concentrations, this might bias my results. To alleviate this concern, I control for country-sector fixed effects, allowing the identification to be driven by within country-sector variation. Third, because the presence of a tax-haven subsidiary might be a noisy measure, I confirm that my results hold if I use the tax-to-revenue ratio as a proxy for the absence of tax avoidance.====My findings differ from some existing theories on the political economy of economic development. Besley and Persson’s influential “pillars of prosperity” theory (Besley and Persson, 2011) asserts that successful states simultaneously develop “legal capacity” (protection of property rights and political constraints) and fiscal capacity. In this view, these two capacities reinforce each other. My theory implies a more complex relationship between fiscal capacity and property rights protection: Because firms pay taxes to increase the opportunity costs of expropriation, perfect property rights protection actually ==== fiscal capacity. While in many countries fiscal capacity correlates with democracy, economic development, and property rights protection, it is not clear that this positive relationship is dynamically sustained.====One example in which the threat of expropriation has apparently helped to reduce tax avoidance of firms is Russia’s “Yukos Affair.” In 2003, the richest person in Russia, oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison, while his main asset, an oil refinery in the Siberian town of Nefteyugansk, was expropriated and merged with the state-owned oil company Rosneft. These events triggered nearly universal condemnation from independent media, Putin’s liberal opposition, and the West. While few observers denied that Khodorkovsky’s firm Yukos had used clever tax optimization schemes and had exploited weaknesses in the tax code and imperfect tax enforcement, so too had other private firms that did not face punishment (Shleifer and Treisman, 2001). The arrest and sentencing of Khodorkovsky were widely regarded as a selective application of justice probably motivated by political reasons. Nevertheless, after Khodorkovsky’s arrest, other private oil firms changed their tax behavior rapidly. Fig. A1.1 in the Appendix shows that before the “Yukos Affair,” the effective tax rate was around 20 percent, but in 2003 it jumped up to 29 percent (which cannot be explained by changes in oil prices or Russia’s tax law) and remained high until oil prices collapsed in 2009. While the treatment of Yukos was unfair and violated international law, it did contribute to the buildup of Russia’s fiscal capacity.====My argument has important policy implications. Scholars and policy makers often view the protection of the property rights of international investors as one of the most important goals of international law. A huge part of international diplomacy is devoted to the protection of broadly defined property rights (Wellhausen, 2014). If my argument is correct, then the additional protection that companies enjoy from courts, treaties, and diplomatic efforts might have the undesirable side effect of harming the tax capacity of host nations. The international effort to protect the property rights of international investors – however laudable it might be – should be balanced by the equally enthusiastic understanding of the damages of tax avoidance.",Political economy of cross-border income shifting: A protection racket approach,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000257,22 July 2022,2022,Research Article,48.0
Peveri Julieta,"Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, AMSE, 5-9 Bd Maurice Bourdet, 13001 Marseille, France","Received 17 August 2021, Revised 13 June 2022, Accepted 28 June 2022, Available online 20 July 2022, Version of Record 18 November 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jce.2022.06.001,Cited by (1),"This paper assesses how national leaders’ quality of governance varies with their career and education. Using a sample of 1,000 rulers between 1931 and 2010, I identify three types of leaders: military leaders, academics, and politicians. Military leaders are associated with an overall negative performance, while politicians who have held important offices before taking power tend to perform well. Academics have on average non-significant effects. These results are partially driven by differences in policy decisions and in leadership styles. Military leaders spend less in health and education, are more likely to establish a personalistic regime, to disrespect the constitution, and to move towards a non-electoral regime, while the reverse holds for politicians. Additionally, this paper highlights the weakness of using educational attainment as a proxy for politicians’ quality, and of growth as a measure of national leaders’ performance.","The debate on who should be at the head of a state goes back to at least the beginning of the Athenian democracy when most of the public offices were randomly selected by lottery. For Aristotle, it was a fair feature of democracy: everyone gets a say regardless of their background.==== Among critics of this practice, Socrates pointed out the incompetence factor: “No one would choose a pilot or builder or flutist by lot, nor any other craftsman for work in which mistakes are far less disastrous than mistakes in statecraft” (Xenophon, Memorabilia Book I, 2.9). Individual backgrounds affect beliefs, skills, preferences, and degree of risk-aversion; features that are likely to be relevant to leaders’ policy decisions and ultimately to the overall performance of the state they run.====This paper uses a worldwide sample of a thousand national leaders who were in office between 1931 and 2010 to assess whether some categories of rulers perform better than others. I first estimate their effects on their quality of governance, measured by economic growth, democracy, corruption, rule of law, property rights, and conflict. I use a recent method proposed by Easterly and Pennings (2020) to isolate national leaders’ effects from their countries and their regions’ effects in a more precise way than by using fixed effects. In a second step, I analyze how those estimates vary according to the leaders’ backgrounds. For this purpose, I identify three groups of leaders based on their academic track record and previous career: academics, politicians, and military leaders. Each of these contains two or more sub-categories allowing for a more granular analysis.====I find robust evidence that leaders’ backgrounds are significantly correlated with their quality of governance. Leaders with a former military career tend to be associated with an overall negative effect. Conversely, politicians who have held important offices before becoming national leaders, such as former prime ministers or vice-presidents, are associated with improvements in national outcomes. Using an aggregated outcome, that goes from −4.3 to 3 and summarizes the six indicators used for performance, the effect of military leaders is around −0.6, while politicians have a nearly symmetric effect of 0.5.====I investigate two potential channels that can account for the previous findings. First, education, experience, and institutional quality might correlate with the constructed leaders’ categories and be at play. I find that the positive effect associated with politicians is partially triggered by their longer experience in politics before entering office. When it comes to education, having a university degree in law, economics, or political science is not systematically associated with a positive or negative effect on the quality of governance. Together with the non-significant effect of academics, this weakens the support for the idea that more educated leaders are more desirable. Additionally, the overall negative performance of military rulers is explained, at least to some extent, by the lower constraints on the executive of the nations they run. Yet, constraints on leaders, education, and experience are not enough to explain the effects of leaders’ backgrounds on national performance. Instead, I provide suggestive evidence that rulers with different backgrounds undertake different policy decisions and have different leadership styles. Military rulers (politicians) invest less (more) in education and health, are more (less) likely to switch to a non-electoral regime, to disrespect constitution, and to establish a regime based on personal authority, which pervades formal institutions. All those variables show in turn a strong correlation with the leaders’ effects previously estimated. This second channel is consistent with life experiences affecting behaviors, which is a basic premise of sociology and psychology (Horowitz and Stam, 2014). More precisely, leaders’ backgrounds shape preferences, skills, the assessment of costs and benefits of each action, leadership styles and policy decisions.====It is also relevant to consider how leaders’ backgrounds interact with institutions. I find that the positive effect of politicians vanishes when initial institutional constraints are strong. This is in line with Ottinger and Voigtländer (2021) who find that leaders’ abilities matter only under unconstrained regimes, and with Besley et al. (2011) who show that educated leaders improve growth only in autocracies. Constraints can also compensate for the negative effect of military leaders, compatibly with the idea that institutions can discipline politicians. Therefore, institutional constraints can avoid the negative effect of bad leaders, but they also hamper the positive impact of good rulers. Nonetheless, the aforementioned differences in the extent to which they respect constitution, manipulate electoral regimes and impose authority based on personal patronage rather than on law or ideology suggest that leaders have room to evade institutional constraints. Altogether, both leaders’ backgrounds and institutions matter for national outcomes, and they interact with each other.====One of the major threats to identification is the endogeneity in the timing of political transitions, implying that the probability of observing a leader in a certain country at a certain time depends on his current and past performance. To assess this issue, I follow Jones and Olken (2005), who focus on transitions where the leader died while in power by natural causes, considering these as unpredictable events and therefore independent of economic conditions. The results are robust with this sample restriction. Moreover, the methodology used in this paper provides estimators that have been shown to be accurate in the presence of endogeneity in transitions (Easterly and Pennings, 2020). A second concern is that leaders’ backgrounds are endogenous to the initial quality of governance, in particular to the level of democracy. Indeed, it is more common to see former military staff in autocracies, where there are fewer academics, former mayors, governors, and civil servants. The results hold when controlling for the initial level of democracy and the initial property rights score. However, the last controls do not fully solve the endogeneity in leaders’ backgrounds. Besides, it is not possible to tackle endogeneity in timing together with endogeneity in leaders’ backgrounds. Hence, the estimates presented in this paper cannot be fully interpreted as causal. They remain nonetheless informative and support the recent evidence that individual characteristics of politicians matter for aggregated outcomes. Finally, despite leaders’ categories being data-driven, there is an unavoidable degree of arbitrariness when creating leaders’ groups. I show the robustness of these choices by using a LASSO estimation to select under an unsupervised approach the best set of predictors among a large pool of leaders’ characteristics.====This paper refers to the broad literature on the impact of individual leaders in shaping aggregated outcomes. From history to economics, the debate is polarized. Defenders of the Great Man theory such as Thomas Carlyle or Sidney Hook argue that history can be largely explained by decisions and actions impulsed by certain leaders.==== Conversely, many philosophers consider historical events and leaders as determined by the society itself. In economics, we can find a resembling rift in the literature of the origins and persistence of the great divergence between the poorest and richest nations. Factors such as geography, culture, history, and institutions have been highlighted to a great extent. Besley (2005) instead points out that the major economic changes over the past two centuries can be attributed to individual political leaders. Beyond observational evidence, Jones and Olken (2005) provide causal evidence that national leaders shape the growth path of a country.====If national leaders matter, it is important to explore how their characteristics map to their effects. This paper mainly contributes to the literature that studies how national leaders’ characteristics affect national outcomes. A closely related paper is the one by Besley et al. (2011), who tested whether the impact of leaders on their nation’s economic growth varies according to their educational attainment, finding a positive association. Leaders with an economic background are also associated with higher growth rates in democracies (Brown, 2020) and with higher foreign direct investment in autocracies (François et al., 2020). National leaders’ backgrounds also affect the implementation of market-liberalization reforms (Dreher et al., 2009), the level of democracy in developing countries (Mercier, 2016), corruption in Africa (Efobi, 2015) and militarized conflicts (Horowitz and Stam, 2014).====Closely related is the literature on politicians’ quality and valence. While many theoretical models have disentangled “good” politicians from “bad” ones, it is empirically challenging to detect them and to measure their quality.==== Certainly, the quality of leaders is unobserved and difficult to quantify. Thus, it is common to use the level of education or previous experience as a proxy for politicians’ valence.==== Moreover, candidates themselves tend to strengthen their education or previous careers in political campaigns, suggesting that this would impact voters’ perception of their abilities. Yet, as argued by Volden et al. (2020), the mapping between personal traits and subsequent politicians’ performance is often opaque.==== Some novel works measure politicians’ ability by exploiting unusual data, such as Ottinger and Voigtländer (2021) who focus on monarchs’ intellectual ability scores instrumented by their degree of breeding, or Dal Bó et al. (2017) who rely on politicians’ IQ scores.====My empirical frame differs from previous works in three ways. First, I focus on multiple outcomes to measure national leaders’ quality of governance in a broad sense.==== Second, I use data-driven categories that allow me to exploit detailed information on national leaders’ backgrounds and to reduce prior judgment on the selection of attributes that affect leaders’ performance. Third, the cited studies use fixed effects or the average outcome to measure the ruler’s impact. Here, I use the leaders’ value-added estimators of Easterly and Pennings (2020), which better isolates rulers’ effects from shocks and countries’ effects, and detects significant leaders in relative terms both with respect to other rulers in their region at the same time and to leaders in the same country at different times.====With these new features, my results contribute to the existing literature by showing first that the positive effect of university education is positive for growth, consistent with Besley et al. (2011), but negative or non-significant on all other indicators, in line with Carnes and Lupu (2016). Leaders’ effects on growth are uncorrelated with leaders’ effects on all other outcomes. Together with the notices of Easterly and Pennings (2020) regarding the difficulty of using growth rate to identify leaders’ effects given its noise and volatility, as well as the high variation across alternative data sources, this paper emphasizes that the most widely used proxies for national leaders’ performance (growth) and leaders’ quality (graduate education) have to be taken with precaution.==== Second, I show that leaders’ previous experience in politics, both in the type of office and the number of years of experience, is informative of a positive overall performance and rulers’ military career is strongly associated with negative effects. Third, I provide suggestive evidence that leaders from different backgrounds choose different policies: politicians are associated with higher levels of social spending, and the reverse applies to military rulers. Fourth, I show that leaders’ effects interact with institutions. I support previous findings by Jones and Olken, 2005, Besley et al., 2011, and Ottinger and Voigtländer (2021) that leaders’ effects are stronger under unconstrained regimes, and I also show that leaders of different types differ on the extent to which they respect formal institutions. Altogether, these results contribute to the mapping between leaders’ attributes and their performance.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing related literature. Section 3 describes the data and sources used in this work. Section 4 provides the estimations for leaders’ effects. Section 5 analyzes how leaders’ backgrounds affect the quality of governance. Section 6 presents the results of robustness checks, and Section 7 concludes.","The wise, the politician, and the strongman: Types of national leaders and quality of governance",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000439,20 July 2022,2022,Research Article,49.0

To preclude the confounding impact of land losses on the behavior of displaced households, we adopt a novel approach comparing unaffected households in counties with massive ULRs and their counterparts in land-requisitioned counties without widespread ULRs, adjusted by their respective control group households in adjacent non-land-requisitioned counties. The group from counties with widespread ULRs exhibits significantly lower trust in local governments, employs risk-proof strategies to cope with perceived PRI, and experiences a decline in farming efficiency and household welfare.","There is widespread global concern about undercompensated land expropriation by the state through eminent domain (Behrer et al., 2021). In the developing world, the state requisition and conversion of agricultural land for nonagricultural uses is much more frequent as a prelude to industrialization and urbanization. Broad interpretations of the “public interest” and weak judicial systems often enable the state and industrialists to implement undercompensated land requisitions (ULRs), which benefit themselves at the expense of displaced rural households, thus creating social tension (Singh, 2012; Ghatak and Mookherjee, 2014). Whether or not displaced rural households receive adequate compensation is a primary indicator of property rights security and is instrumental to equity and efficiency in public policy making and the maintenance of social stability.====As a complement to the prevailing research on the incentive effects of land titling reforms, we attempt to fill a gap in the literature by gauging the adverse effects on rural household behavior and welfare generated by ULRs and the resulting property rights insecurity (PRI). One empirical challenge typically encountered in this field of work is that the loss of land lots forces the affected agrarian households to change or diversify their livelihoods, which mingles the wealth effect with the incentive effect. For example, the affected households could reduce agricultural investments because of their shrinking landholdings or the disincentives created by land expropriations or both. This study adopts a novel approach to preclude the wealth effect and highlight the disincentive effects of ULRs. Specifically, we examine the spillover of perceived PRI from undercompensated farmers to unaffected neighboring households within the same village community. Although their landholdings remain intact at present, they may fear that one day they will suffer from a similar misfortune under a predatory local government. This perceived PRI, indicated by their likely lower trust in local governments, prompts them to adopt risk-proof household behaviors as a precaution. Examining this empathy effect enables us to assess how perceived PRI affects household behaviors and to separate the impact of actual property rights encroachment from that of expected PRI. This approach allows us to gauge the negative externality effect of ULRs on economic efficiency and welfare in rural areas.====Using a unique nationwide household survey dataset covering land expropriations administered by county governments in rural China in 2011, 2013, and 2015, we collected a sample of counties having experienced land requisitions. Among them, we identified a set of PRI-treated counties in which the majority of the affected rural households received land-requisition compensation lower than official compensation standards promised by the county governments. To attenuate the selection bias and distinguish the effect of perceived PRI from the effect of wealth losses following land plot expropriation, we employ an identification strategy based on contiguous control groups. In particular, we first examine the difference in the behavioral pattern between unaffected households in PRI-treated counties and households in adjacent control counties (without land expropriation experiences). We then use panel difference-in-differences (DID) analysis to compare this difference with the difference in such aspects between unaffected households in non-PRI-treated counties and households in their contiguous control counties. We find robust evidence that unaffected households within PRI-treated counties exhibit more significant risk-proof behaviors than unaffected households in non-PRI-treated counties, after adjusting for the differences between them and the corresponding bordering counties. Specifically, relative to the unaffected households in the non-PRI-treated counties, the unaffected households in PRI-treated counties reduced their investment in agricultural production, curtailed entrepreneurial activities, and switched to wage-earning jobs, increased the size of land lots leased to others, and cut the size of land lots leased from others. In addition, predatory land expropriation decreased agricultural production efficiency and the welfare of villagers, as reflected in lower household income and consumption expenditure. The negative effects of ULRs on efficiency and welfare therefore go well beyond the affected households and spill over to unaffected neighboring households that anticipate that similar predatory events will occur in the future.====Our identification strategy is based on the assumption that both affected and unaffected households share similar perceptions of the property rights environment. To test the existence of the empathy effect, we use the information regarding villagers’ ==== trust in local governments’ policy promises—that is, whether or not they still believe that local governments will honor their promises to fulfill their obligations in the provision of pensions in the future—as an indicator of rural households’ trust in the credibility of the policy commitment made by local governments. As expected, we find that only within PRI-treated counties do both the affected household group and the unaffected household group share deteriorated perceptions of the local PRI environment.====This study contributes to the literature on property rights security and its effects on household behaviors in two ways. First, for many developing countries, the PRI problem arises from not only the absence of well-defined ==== property rights but also predatory governments that lack the incentive or capacity (or both) to keep their commitment to abstain from preying on those they should otherwise protect (Besley and Ghatak, 2010). Existing micro-level research on the importance of property rights has largely focused on how rural households respond to governments’ weak property rights protection in the form of property titling and issuing property certifications ( Banerjee et al., 2002; Besley and Ghatak, 2010; De Janvry et al., 2015; Goldstein et al., 2018;Jacoby et al., 2002). Research in this area has seldom considered how households respond to governments’ predatory interventions.==== By comparing the actual compensation that a large proportion of households received with the official land-taking compensation standard set by the county governments, we capture the predatory nature of local governments’ land expropriations and explore its effects on households’ economic behaviors. Our study sheds light on the consequences of ULRs, which are a prevalent social issue around the world.====Second, our research design allows us to distinguish the channels through which land expropriations affect households’ investment decisions and labor allocation. That is, ULRs could expose households to the government's expropriation threat and thus distort their behavior, such as by reducing agricultural investment. This can also happen when land requisitions lead to a reduction in land holdings ==== that can be transferred or used as a productive asset. In this study, we exploit the empathy unaffected households feel for affected households within the same PRI-treated county to present evidence of the PRI effect on household behavior. This approach also sheds light on the negative externality generated by PRI.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces China's land expropriation and compensation policy, discusses the implications of government land acquisitions for PRI as perceived by rural households and their likely responses, and proposes the testable hypotheses. Section 3 introduces the data and key variables. Section 4 discusses the identification strategy. Section 5 examines the impact of ULRs on rural households’ trust in the policy promises of local governments. Section 6 investigates households’ behavioral responses to land expropriations.

We examine the territory under dominion of the Roman Empire at the zenith of its geographical extension (117 CE), and find a remarkable pattern of persistence showing that greater Roman road density goes along with (a) greater modern road density, (b) greater settlement formation in 500 CE, and (c) greater economic activity in 2010–2020. Exploiting a natural experiment, we find that persistence in road density and the strong link between early road density and contemporary economic development weaken to the point of insignificance in areas where the use of wheeled vehicles was abandoned and caravan trade routes replaced road-based trade from the first millennium CE until the late modern period. Studying channels of persistence, we identify the emergence of market towns during the early medieval period and the modern era as a robust mechanism sustaining the persistent effects of the Roman ====. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the channels through which persistence in comparative development comes about.","The literature on comparative development has drawn attention to a remarkable degree of persistence in economic activity: places that were relatively more advanced in pre-industrial times tend to be comparatively more prosperous today — see e.g. Olsson and Hibbs, 2005, Comin et al., 2010, Chanda et al., 2014, and Maloney and Valencia Caicedo (2016). As an illustration, Fig. 1 depicts the relationship between contemporary population density and the intensity of Roman settlements in 500 CE, within the territory of the Roman Empire in 117 CE.====This insight has led to extensive research about the fundamental origins of comparative development in (geographic) initial conditions, and historical processes that shaped cultural traits and the institutional infrastructure of societies. Yet much less attention has been devoted to the study of persistence in proximate determinants of growth, or factors that could be the channel that connects fundamentals to economic development in the past and in the present. A deeper understanding of the channels through which persistence in comparative development comes about may provide important clues as to which fundamentals are important, and how to potentially stimulate development in situations where important fundamentals are lacking.====This paper studies the persistence of transport infrastructure, and its effects on comparative long-term economic development, starting in antiquity with the establishment of the Roman roads network. As discussed in detail below, Roman road construction did not follow the rules of infrastructure planning in the contemporary era. The Roman roads were built mainly with a military purpose in mind, and geographic obstacles in the landscape were often surmounted rather than evaded. Despite this, our analysis uncovers a remarkable degree of persistence in road density across time and space: areas that attained greater road density during antiquity are characterized by a significantly higher road density today. Moreover, Roman roads were linked to economic activity by the end of antiquity, and remain a strong correlate of prosperity today. Overall, these results provide evidence that the provision of public transport infrastructure is an important channel through which persistence in economic development (as Fig. 1 illustrates) may arise.====In our analysis, we confine attention to localities defined as grid cells of one degree latitude by one degree longitude that were part of the Roman Empire by the beginning of the second century CE (117 CE), and that were ==== by at least one Roman road. By omitting areas that fell outside the Empire, as well as areas unconnected to the road network, we hope to disentangle the influence of physical infrastructure on economic outcomes from the legacy of Roman rule more broadly.====To further limit the risk of confounding the impact of the Roman roads with Roman influence in general terms, and to filter out the impact of modern day institutions and sub-national differences in cultural values, we also control for country fixed effects as well as language fixed effects throughout our econometric analysis. We believe this strategy makes it unlikely that our results are driven by the legacy of Roman rule in the broadest terms. Nevertheless, a natural remaining concern is that areas receiving more Roman roads may differ in various geographic dimensions that by themselves may have influenced comparative economic development. We attempt to surmount this challenge in two different ways.====For starters, it is important to observe that the risk of confounding the influence of roads with geography may not be as great as one might think. According to the historical literature, it is conventional wisdom that major Roman roads were built in order to facilitate the movement of troops across the empire, rather than with the objective of enhancing economic development. Moreover, the location of roads was arguably only to a limited extent dictated by geographic circumstances. In our analysis we examine these arguments statistically, and find that geographic characteristics account for about a third of the total variation in Roman road density. Hence, we find a claim of orthogonality between geography and Roman road location to be untenable, for which reason we include a rich set of geographical characteristics as baseline controls when exploring the persistence of early road infrastructure and its predictive power vis-a-vis economic development over time.====Yet, doubts may still linger about whether that control strategy is sufficient. Therefore, our second strategy to assess the importance of potentially omitted geographic characteristics consists in exploiting the remarkable time span of abandonment of wheeled transportation in North Africa and the Middle East. According to the landmark study by Bulliet (1990 [1975]), wheeled transport disappeared in North Africa and the Middle East somewhere between the fourth and sixth centuries CE. Eventually wheeled transport vehicles had to be reintroduced with the ascent of the automobile.==== Consequently, following the fall of the western part of the Roman Empire, the roads fell into disrepair, and ultimately went out of use in North Africa and the Middle East. In contrast, Roman roads continued to be maintained and in use in Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire (Glick 2005 [1979]; Hitchener, 2012, Wahl, 2017).====From the point of view of our study, this natural experiment has two important implications. First, as the ancient roads fall into disuse and thus are left unmaintained, it becomes much less likely that modern roads are built in their place. In that sense, one would expect to see a far weaker link between Roman road density and modern road density outside the European part of the empire. Second, if the roads create persistence in economic development, one would expect to find a far weaker link between ancient infrastructure and modern-day economic activity within the regions where roads temporarily lost relevance. Consistent with these conjectures, we find that there is no significant link between ancient infrastructure and modern infrastructure ==== North Africa and the Middle East. Moreover, within these two regions the ancient infrastructure is not a significant predictor of economic activity today. In contrast, in Europe – the region where roads continued to be used and therefore maintained – ancient roads predict modern roads as well as prosperity.====This differentiated effect of Roman road density is revealing from the point of view of identifying channels of influence. Naturally, the fundamental principles governing the construction of the Roman roads were the same throughout the Empire. If our baseline results are tainted by omitted variables bias – for example due to missing geographic characteristics that matter both for road location and subsequent economic activity – one would expect to see evidence of an apparent persistence of infrastructure density as well as a persistent impact from ancient infrastructure on modern economic activity throughout the entire empire. Accordingly, in light of our findings, the “abandonment of the wheel”-experiment provides fairly compelling evidence of the mechanism under scrutiny: persistence in public infrastructure leads to persistence in economic activity.====To further examine the Roman roads pattern of non-persistence in the Middle East and the North of Africa (MENA), we look at the relationship between roads and the caravan routes that emerged in this region with the rise of Islam. This exercise shows a mix of statistically null and small but negative connection between Roman roads and the caravan routes that emerged in MENA after 632 CE. This supports the interpretation we offer with respect to the abandonment of the wheel experiment: when caravans took over trade corridors changed and roads were left unmaintained ultimately loosing importance.====In the last part of our empirical analysis, we analyze a potential mechanism behind the persistence from ancient to modern roads in Europe: the emergence of market towns during the extended medieval period. Using data from a geographical corridor along the Roman ==== in modern Germany, we show that in the former Roman areas that had a dense road network in antiquity, market towns were significantly more likely to arise during the medieval period.====The present study is related to several strands of literature. First, it is related to research on long-run persistence in economic development — see recent summaries e.g. in Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2013, Nunn, 2014 and Ashraf and Galor (2018). This literature has largely been concerned with the influence and origins of fundamental determinants of productivity that ultimately can explain persistence in comparative development.==== In contrast, the present paper focuses on channels of persistence, or the persistence of ==== sources of growth. In particular, the focus is on whether public goods provision appears to be persistent over long periods of time. From this perspective, our work is related to Chen et al. (2017), who look within China and document a remarkable persistence of another proximate source of growth: education. The authors argue persuasively that the observed persistence is (at least in part) explained by the emergence of a pro-education culture prompted by early educational investments. Importantly, the argument is supported by the fact that persistence in schooling weakens markedly in areas that were particularly exposed to the anti-intellectual Cultural Revolution. Huilery (2009) illustrates similar long-term effects for the case of colonial investments in education, health, and infrastructure in West Africa; and Franco et al. (2021) the long-term effects of ancient transport infrastructure in South America — they show in particular that roads built during the Inca Empire in the territory of present-day Peru are associated with higher wages, better nutrition and better schooling outcomes today and, again importantly, that the provision of primary schools and roads is an important driver of the persistent effects.====Our study documents that the provision of Roman public road infrastructure is similarly persistent over very long periods of time, except in areas where roads lost economic value early on. By carefully controlling for the influence of (countrywide) formal institutions and (within-country) informal institutions, our findings indicate that this persistence is unlikely to be mediated by the emergence of cultural values or institutions. Instead, our analysis suggests that later roads likely were built on top of older roads, thus creating persistence in road density.==== Of course, in places where the signs of the early roads disappear, modern roads would be less likely to be located along the ancient trajectories.====Second, our paper also contributes to a small but growing literature on the economics of the Roman period (Finley, 1973, Temin, 2012, Bowman and Wilson, 2009, Michaels and Rauch, 2017, Benedictis et al., 2018). A striking feature of the classic work by Finley (1973), for instance, is its relative neglect of the general importance of roads. A common theme is that road transport was inferior to shipping in terms of efficiency and hence of less importance. Recent research however has started to re-examine the influence of the Roman road network on long-run development. Bosker et al. (2013), studying determinants of city growth between 800 CE and 1800, document that cities located at intersection points (hubs) between Roman roads grew bigger in Europe, but not in the Middle East and North Africa. The authors note that this was most likely due to the emergence of more efficient camel transportation in the extensive desert areas of that region, which followed very different paths than the Roman roads as we describe above. Bosker et al. (2013) also study the impact of caravan routes and hubs in the Muslim world.==== The present study focuses on the persistence of infrastructure over time, which is not discussed in Bosker et al. (2013). Three of our outcome variables are further contemporary whereas Bosker et al.’s empirical analysis ends in 1800.====Using data on excavated Roman ceramics, Fluckinger et al. (2019) study network connectivity within the general Roman transport system. The authors find that trade between locations during antiquity still explains a great deal of the variation in the spatial pattern of contemporary firm ownership. A key mechanism for this persistence is the convergence in preferences and cultural values. The analysis in Fluckinger et al. (2019) is based on a gravity-type of empirical analysis, using measures of bilateral integration between regions as the dependent variable, whereas our analysis uses the cross-sectional variation within countries and language areas with night lights intensity and levels of population as proxies for levels of contemporary economic prosperity.====Also related is the work of Wahl (2017), who investigates the Roman ==== inside Germany and finds that contemporary development is more advanced on the old Roman side of the ==== border using a regression discontinuity design. Wahl (2017) identifies the road system as an important explanatory factor, which is consistent with our findings about the European part of the Empire. At the same time, our analysis provides evidence on how shocks in the past, such a abandonment of the wheel, can importantly perturb development trajectories with long-run implications for comparative development.==== Using Wahl’s (2017) sample of grid cells along the Roman border within modern Germany, and combining it with data on the rise of market towns after 850 CE from Cantoni and Yuchtman (2014), we show that the more prevalent emergence of markets in the old Roman areas suggests that the development of trade nodes was a key intermediate channel for the persistence of historical infrastructure into modern times.====Third, in recent years, a surge of interest in the economic effects of infrastructure has resulted in a number of important studies. The results indicate that infrastructure investments often have a strong positive influence on population growth and economic activity.==== A major difference with the present study obviously consists of the time horizon over which the consequences of infrastructure investments are assessed; with a two millennia perspective we believe the present study has the longest observation window hitherto explored. At the same time it is important to stress that the objective of the present study is not to estimate the productivity gains from infrastructure per se. In fact, our approach does not allow us to distinguish whether areas that received more infrastructure investments outgrew areas with less infrastructure because of productivity benefits from public goods, or if more public goods in a particular location simply attracted activity from other locations. As should be clear, the main focus of the present study is rather to assess the persistence of public goods provision and thereby whether public goods provision has a significant role to play in the observed pattern of persistence of comparative development.====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present our data on Roman roads, and our outcome variables. In Section 3, we outline an historical background on the assignment of Roman roads as well as formal tests of the geographical determinants of Roman road density. In Section 4, we present and discuss the main empirical results.

By using the shocks to product market competition caused by China's trade liberalization, we find that competition substantially improves SOEs’ decentralization. Furthermore, we also provide evidence of the incentive to exploit local information and roll out an alternative interpretation that government divests itself of SOEs because they become burdensome. Finally, we find that the effect of competition on decentralization is augmented when governments are geographically distant from their SOEs or when SOEs are located in regions characterized by low social trust, high dialect diversity, or heavy pressure for economic growth.","The prior literature has extensively analyzed the effects of competition on firm behaviors,==== although limited focus has been provided on how competition shapes governments’ incentives. Such disregard may be caused by data unavailability, and related studies exclusively focus on theory or political hierarchy (Bloom et al., 2010; Cai and Treisman, 2005; Fan et al., 2009).==== In this study, we attempt to contribute to the literature and policy concerns by examining the effects of competition on governments’ decentralization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Given that the fundamental role of competition in economic growth (Aghion and Griffith, 2005) and SOEs’ decentralization represent the most important economic reforms in China (Huang et al., 2017b), investigating whether competition affects governments’ decentralization of SOEs is critical for researchers and policy-makers to understand China's growth in recent decades.====However, the effects of competition on governments’ decentralization are ambiguous, and opposing views on this topic persist. One claim commonly made in the literature and by policy-makers is that strong competition can make local information valuable because delays to making decisions are costly (Giroud, 2013; Karlsson and Nordén, 2007; Wang, 2019). Theoretically, to gain considerable advantages in a competitive market, smart governments with asymmetric information are incentivized to decentralize their affiliated firms. Moreover, as competition in the market increases, SOEs, often troubled by inefficiency and redundancy, may find it harder to earn profits, as information gathering is costly and decision-making is slow. Therefore, governments also have a pressing reason to delegate oversight rights to lower-level governments to rescue these SOEs (Chen, 1993). Hence, decentralization is positively affected by competition.====Competition can also hinder decentralization. Intense market competition can lead to low market share and low operating income. State-owned enterprises, which often perform badly, do little to provide more taxes, job opportunities, social wealth, and political rents (Knight and Yueh, 2004). Thus, governments have less incentive to engage in activities aimed at reducing costs or increasing profits when the overall effect is ambiguous (Schmidt, 1997). Product market competition makes it possible for managers and politicians to gather commercially sensitive information and imitate the corporate decisions of new rivals (Acemoglu et al., 2007; Boubaker et al., 2018; Dedman and Lennox, 2009), which can counter the information costs resulting from intense competition. Furthermore, as firms in competitive industries are unlikely to make abnormal earnings and divert profits for their own use, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) and Baggs and De Bettignies (2007) argue that competition acts as a disciplinary mechanism to mitigate agency conflicts and improve governance quality. Both mechanisms could hinder the possibility of decentralization.====Given the opposing predictions on the effect of competition on decentralization, the issue is ultimately an empirical one. The identification of the causal effects of competition on government decentralization is a challenging task because competition is endogenously determined by economic growth. Any association between competition and decentralization may reflect unobserved variations in economic conditions and growth opportunities. Thus, we need an identification approach that isolates business-cycle effects and other macroeconomic factors.====To establish causality, we introduce China's World Trade Organization (WTO) accession as an exogenous shock for the following reasons. First, the shock was unanticipated because China's WTO accession process was lengthy, taking approximately 15 years to complete and requiring approval from all WTO member countries, thereby making it elusive and difficult to anticipate (Lu and Yu, 2015) .==== Second, the change was economically significant compared with firms in industries at the 25th percentile of tariff rates in 2001. Trade-induced competition significantly increases the decentralization probability of firms in industries at the 75th percentile by 17%. Third, given the state-ownership structure of SOEs, oversight governments that have ultimate controlling power usually make decisions about delegating control rights to lower governments (Li, 1997; Gan et al., 2018). Thus, it is more likely that firms play passive roles in the decentralization process in our setting, which makes our settings more suitable to identify the role of governments.====We use the WTO shock as a basis to conduct a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation. In particular, we define the treated firm as firms in industries with high import tariff rates in 2001. The control group includes firms in industries with low import tariff rates in 2001. Our DID estimates show a differential change in decentralization in the treatment group relative to firms in the control group. This finding suggests that trade-induced product market competition could significantly increase decentralization. These results are robust across alternative measures of the treatment variable, different sample specifications and controlling for other concurrent policies as of 2001.====Meanwhile, we show that the decentralization difference across all SOEs evolved similarly before the shock, thereby indicating that the parallel trend assumption underlying our identification holds. We also corroborate this interpretation with a placebo analysis. That is, we shift the WTO shock to the firm-year level and find no decentralization difference between the treated and control firms.====Thereafter, we probe the underlying channels by examining the heterogeneous responses of SOEs in the face of competition. We provide evidence that the helping hand exists in poorly performing SOEs and leads to low decentralization for them. This helping hand means that governments would not treat poorly performing SOEs as fiscal burdens and divest themselves of such SOEs. Moreover, we also show that exploiting local information advantage plays a significant role in understanding the impact of competition on government decentralization. In particular, governments would decentralize SOEs that are substantially distant from their oversight governments or located in regions with low social trust, in regions with high dialect diversity, or in regions with high economic growth incentives.====This study contributes to the literature as follows. First, we identify the causal effects of product market competition in shaping the decision-making of governments, which is arguably of fundamental importance to economists and policy-makers. Thus, our findings complement the theoretical study of Cai and Treisman (2005) and empirical research on the effects of the financial market on government agencies (Purnanandam and Weagley, 2016). We examine how competition shifts the government's behavior, thereby enabling us to complement Huang et al. (2017b), who found that when an SOE's distance to the government is far, these enterprises are likely to be decentralized. Moreover, we explore our findings from the perspective of information asymmetry and find that the incentive to seek local information significantly drives our findings.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the determinants of firm decentralization. The majority of related studies on firm decentralization decisions are theoretical in nature and generally focus on the context of trade-off between loss of control (of the principal) and local information advantage (of the agent).==== Bloom et al. (2010) and Bloom et al. (2012) conducted a survey involving manufacturing firms across a dozen countries and showed that high competition and regional trust are significantly associated with a considerable degree of delegation.====However, our setting is different from those of Bloom et al. (2010) and Bloom et al. (2012). In particular, their concept is the traditional role of the financial market in disciplining corporate managers through compensation contracts and does not involve governments’ incentives. In financial markets, the participants trade on the basis of the signal on managers’ performance. Accordingly, value-relevant information is incorporated into the stock prices of firms. In turn, managers’ compensation is linked to stock prices. Thus, managers bear the outcomes of their decisions. This mechanism means that the financial market disciplines firm managers because a bad decision will lower the stock price and managers will suffer through decreased compensation. In our setting, governments do not have stock prices, and no stock-based compensation contracts exist for their operation. Instead, this study shows that the economic incentive behind our finding is local politicians’ concerns about information asymmetry.====Third, we also contribute to the expanding literature on the economic consequences of product market competition. Previous studies have examined the effects of competition on tax avoidance (Cai and Liu, 2009), firm innovation (Aghion et al., 2005; Hombert and Matray, 2018), stock return (Bustamante and Donangelo, 2017), CEO compensation or turnover (Dasgupta et al., 2018; Jung and Subramanian, 2017), managerial disclosure (Huang et al., 2017a), and cost of debt (Valta, 2012). Thus, we add to the literature by showing that product market competition significantly shifts governments’ incentives.====With regard to China's economic reforms, the previous literature has generally focused on privatization (Allen et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008; Estrin et al., 2009; Gan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2011; Liao et al., 2014; Sun and Tong, 2003). However, SOE decentralization has been widespread and important (Huang et al., 2017b). Local governments are playing increasingly important roles in governing SOEs (Bardhan, 2016; Huang et al., 2017b), which remain important in many countries. We believe that our findings could clarify the understanding of the role of local governments and SOEs in China's economic growth.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

Pre-colonial ethnic institutions shape local electoral outcomes and matter for the present and future of African democracies.","The interplay between “state” and “society” shapes the fortune of functioning democracies (Acemoglu and Robinson 2019). In contemporary Africa, this duality manifests itself in the interplay between ==== ethnic institutions and ==== weak state institutions (Migdal 1988). More than 600 million Africans live under the influence of ethnic leaders who exercise control over land allocation, tenure, and redistribution (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou 2015), and recent evidence has highlighted the importance of traditional ethnic institutions for African development (Gennaioli and Rainer 2007, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou 2013). African states lack the capacity to implement decisions throughout their territory, especially in rural areas (Mann, 1984, Herbst, 2000, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2014). A natural question that arises from these findings is whether and how ethnic institutions affect the working of contemporary state institutions, and, in particular, the functioning of democracy.====This paper studies the effect of pre-colonial ethnic institutions on political competitiveness between political parties in democratic elections today. Our analysis leverages geo-referenced data from 15 countries and around 2700 electoral constituencies in sub-Saharan Africa. We establish the level of pre-colonial centralization in each electoral constituency by matching them geographically to historical ethnic homelands (Murdock 1967) and relate this to local electoral outcomes across 32 parliamentary democratic elections. We show that pre-colonial ethnic institutional centralization is negatively correlated with competition between political parties.====Our empirical analysis proceeds as follows. First, we present two case studies that reveal how the degree of pre-colonial political complexity of different ethnic groups informs voting outcomes in Nigeria and Senegal. We then proceed with a quantitative exploration of this relationship across all electoral constituencies and countries in our data to show that a systematic positive relationship exists between a binary quantitative indicator of pre-colonial centralization and a Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI) of vote concentration at the level of the electoral constituency — an inverse measure of political competition. The negative relationship is robust to the inclusion of an array of geographical and historical controls.====To advance on identification, we exploit the redrawing of constituency boundaries over time and changes in the extent to which old and newly drawn constituencies overlap with historical ethnic homelands.==== This allows us to retrieve variation in the identity of the historically dominant ethnic group in the constituency and its degree of pre-colonial institutional complexity. As such, this strategy allows us to net out all time-invariant characteristics at the level of the constituency that could confound this relationship. We find that a high level of pre-colonial institutional centralization is associated with a 0.22 to 0.24 increase in the value of the vote share HHI.====Our study contributes to the literature on pre-colonial ethnic institutions and their contemporary salience in Africa. The strong relationship with electoral outcomes that we document highlights the interplay between traditional ethnic power structures and contemporary state institutions and their representative bodies. A large literature exists on ethnic politics in Africa (Francois et al., 2015, Posner, 2005). Most recent studies show that local ethnic chiefs interact strategically with elected officials, with implications for the allocation of public goods as well as individual labor market outcomes (Franck and Rainer, 2012, Kramon and Posner, 2014, Burgess et al., 2015, de Kadt and Larreguy, 2018, Amodio et al., 2021).==== Baldwin (2015) shows that local chiefs trade their ability to mobilize local communities in exchange for public good provision, for which they hold elected representatives accountable.====An interpretation of our findings consistent with the previous literature is that stronger, more centralized pre-colonial institutions increase the capacity of local chiefs to mobilize voters. This increases their bargaining power and strengthens their relationship with a given party, which both lowers political competition and increases the accountability of elected officials. Public good provision increases as a result, fostering regional development. In the last part of the paper, we explore the quantitative implications of this hypothesis. We use night-time light density as proxy of development at the constituency level, and estimate the effect of political competitiveness on the former using pre-colonial institutional complexity as instrument. That is, we make the (heroic) assumption that pre-colonial institutions do not affect economic outcomes in ways other than through changes in the political landscape, and leverage it to identify the effect of political competitiveness on regional development. We find that lowering political competitiveness has a positive effect on regional development, with the corresponding coefficient estimate being significant at the 10% level.====Our results also speak to the literature on state capacity in African democracies. While several authors have pointed out the existence of democratic traits in pre-colonial African kingdoms (Hjort, 2010, Council, 1992, Bradley, 2005), it is clear that for many of the states that emerged out of the colonial period, these traits were less visible. Collier, 1982, Bates, 2010 note that by the mid-1970s, about 15 years after independence for most Sub-Saharan countries, 16 nations had installed a one-party system. In this sense, democratization is new to these nations, and could be seen as a shedding of old institutions to be replaced by a modern political system. Our study suggests the contrary: pre-colonial institutions ==== have a significant impact on how new democracies are currently functioning in Africa. In fact, our evidence points to a complementarity between ethnic institutions and formal democratic ones, in line with Bergeron, Tourek, and Weigel (2021) on tax collection in the Democratic Republic of Congo.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the dataset used in the empirical analysis as well as the variables of interest. Section 3 presents case studies as preliminary evidence.

Our motivating example and the core of our analysis is a Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA). We measure the efficiency of a ROSCA by the expected waiting time that it takes a participant to attain his goal when no participant reneges on his commitment to contribute to the common fund, and when each of the participants receives (once) the funds needed to meet his goal. Given this criterion, we define the optimal size of a ROSCA as the number of participants that results in the minimal expected waiting time. We show that an optimal size of a ROSCA exists, that it is limited, and that it is a multiple of the number of time periods that it takes an individual to save on his own. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that when treated as a function of the size of a ROSCA, the expected waiting time is not monotonic when the size builds up from an individual saving on his own to the optimal size. A similar result obtains when we study cases where a ROSCA is enlarged beyond the optimal size. Our findings help explain the limited size as well as other features of ROSCAs observed in developing countries all over the world.","Joint savings associations in general, and Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) in particular, are intriguing pieces of social-financial engineering, a form of microfinancing by which poor people who have limited or no access to the formal financial market can avoid being dependent on banks and other formal lending institutions, and they are also attractive ways to speed up the acquisition of a desired (often an indivisible) good. Succinctly described as “an association formed upon a core of participants who make regular contributions to a fund, which is given, in whole or in part, to each contributor in rotation” (Ardener, 1964), and as “a voluntary grouping of individuals who agree to contribute financially at each of a set of uniformly-spaced dates towards the creation of a fund, which will then be allotted in accordance with some prearranged principle to each member of the group in turn” (Calomiris and Rajaraman, 1998), ROSCAs were and remain particularly popular in developing countries (see the reviews by Geertz, 1962; Bouman, 1995; Anderson et al., 2009; and the references cited in Besley et al., 1993). There is evidence that the numbers and incidence of ROSCAs in the developing world have been, respectively, large and widespread. (See, for example, Bouman, 1977, and Ahn et al., 2017.)====Suppose that it takes 12 pesos to buy a tin roof, and that I can save one peso per week, so that it will take me 12 weeks to build up the funds needed to get the roof; and suppose that it will take you that long too. Each of us receives pay, say a wage payment, or a “paycheck” at the end of each week. (We hasten to add that a “week” here is just a name of a period of time; contributions can be made monthly, or following harvests, which occur less frequently than monthly.) Suppose that instead of saving individually we save jointly, and that by the time we have jointly accumulated 12 pesos, we toss a coin to determine who will receive the amount in the “pot.” The winner of the draw will be able to install the roof after 6 weeks rather than 12 weeks, and the other co-saver - 6 weeks afterwards.==== Our expected waiting time is reduced from 12 weeks to 9 weeks, namely by a quarter. Suppose that there are, say, four of us saving jointly. Then, the points in time at which the “pot” becomes “full” are three, six, nine, and twelve weeks from the start. Applying the rule of random allocation of the accumulated funds to the participants, the expected waiting time is ==== weeks, a reduction in the expected waiting time from 12 weeks by ====. This rate of reduction is more than a quarter. To check whether this is a precursor to ==== in reductions in the expected waiting time, we let the number of co-savers rise from four to five who together accumulate 5 pesos per week. The five co-savers will obtain the first “full pot” in 3 weeks from the start (with 3 pesos carried over), the second “full pot” in 5 weeks from the start (with 1 peso as a surplus), the third “full pot” in 8 weeks from the start (with 4 pesos as a surplus), the fourth “full pot” in 10 weeks from the start (with 2 pesos as a surplus), and the fifth “full pot” in 12 weeks from the start. The expected waiting time in the case of joint saving by five participants, which is ==== weeks, is longer than the expected waiting time in the case of joint saving by four participants, which as we have shown is ==== weeks. So, assuming that all the members in a ROSCA abide by the terms of participation (continued saving at the agreed rate until each of them reaches the goal of being allocated the funds needed for buying the tin roof), what number of members will reduce the expected waiting time to a minimum?====Students of ROSCAs have been aware of the limited number of participants in these schemes. Adams and Canavesi de Sahonero (1989) report that in Bolivia, the average number of participants in ROSCAs is ten. Drawing on a review of 142 ROSCAs in India, Guha and Gupta (2005) infer that the number of participants in a ROSCA ranges from eight to thirteen. A similar finding is reported by Velez-Ibanez (2010) for Mexico, where very few ROSCAs have more than twenty participants. Etang et al. (2011) report that in Cameroon ROSCAs had at most 45 participants. Kedir and Ibrahim (2011) report that the median number of ROSCA participants in Ethiopia is 24. Acquah and Dahal (2018) note that the median size of an Indonesian ROSCA is 37.====The existing literature lists three main reasons for the limited size of a ROSCA. Each of these reasons invites a short reflection.====One explanation is purely technical: managing a large ROSCA is demanding (Armendariz and Morduch, 2005; Velez-Ibanez, 2010). This explanation is similar to an argument that ROSCAs are not larger because smaller ROSCAs allow for easier monitoring of the participants. However, the monitoring rationale may not be that much of an issue. In many villages across the developing world, the organization of a ROSCA is simple and transparent; the participants deposit their contributions with the organizer, say a shopkeeper who then, with a chalk on a piece of cardboard, marks an extra “+” next to the name of contributing member. There need not be much to monitor, and compliance or lack thereof is visible to everyone. (In his vivid description of the operation of a ROSCA, Bouman (1979) remarks: “[ROSCAs] admirably fit into the scenery of a low-keyed economy. There is no office, transactions being conducted at the house of the organizer ...==== ====. There is a blissful lack of bureaucracy and paperwork. The only visible expense is a soiled exercise book to keep accounts.”)====A second reason is of a “moral hazard” type: as noted by Besley et al. (1993), for a ==== duration of the scheme, the higher the number of participants, the shorter the waiting time for one of the participants to be the first to receive the “pot,” thus the greater the temptation for this participant to default: winning the draw to receive the “pot” earlier implies that the duration of the commitment to contribute to the common pool will be longer. As we show in this paper, it is not optimal to fix the duration of a ROSCA and then match that duration with different numbers of participants; ====. In addition, the “moral hazard” reasoning ignores the flip side of the same coin: when the purpose of participation in a ROSCA is to speed up the acquisition or installation of an implement that boosts production, then getting the “pot” early translates into earlier higher productivity and earnings, which renders honoring the commitment to continue to contribute easier; longer need not then mean harder. Forming a ROSCA to expedite the installation of a tin roof has nice second-round effects beyond the reduction of the expected waiting time. Living in a better insulated house provides protection against bad weather, colds, and other causes of morbidity. This allows for increased productivity and a boost to earnings. And, of course, the installation of a tin roof (investment in housing) is an example. The purpose of savings could also be the installation of a farm-specific implement such as a tube well (investment in agriculture) with a direct gain to farm production and earnings.====Another reflection on this second reason is that a good way to see to it that the participants in a ROSCA will honor the ROSCA's terms of agreement is to team up with people who are close to each other in social space so as to provide the trust needed for collaborative saving. In the developing world, a ROSCA is typically a village or community arrangement, not an inter-village or inter-community arrangement. Geertz (1962) writes that “[ROSCAs] are usually formed by a ==== group of three or four householders through a common agreement, and other households are then invited to join” (emphasis added). And Besley et al. (1994) write that “the typical scenario for a rosca is a group of individuals who work in the same office block or belong to the same community.” That said, concern that a participant in a ROSCA might renege may not be all that realistic when we bear in mind, first, that as evidence suggests, participation in a ROSCA is not a once in a lifetime experience;==== the life span of a ROSCA can be years, with renewals within and across years.==== As is well known from game theory, the expectation or likelihood of repetition is a powerful disciplining device, a reason to establish a good reputation. And second, by and large, and as already noted, a ROSCA is set up ==== a village or community where bad behavior can result in swift and painful social sanctions.====There are good reasons to assume that participants in a ROSCA will not tend to default, and evidence supports this conjecture. For example, Handa and Kirton (1999) report that only 2.5% of the ROSCA members that they surveyed witnessed any incidence of delinquent contributions. What incentive does an early winner of a draw have not to renege? What can participants who contributed to the savings pool but did not win the first “pot” do to effectively dissuade the co-saver who received the “pot” from reneging? If they use means that help cement joint saving, the perceived risk involved in joint financing can be moderated, and this form of financing will be attractive. Conversely, when such means are not available, lone saving will be more appealing. A standard list of responses to the preceding two questions includes social deterrents, reputational concerns, and repeat transactions, with obvious linkages between the three.====Compliance can be strengthened by applying social pressure, for example in the form of sanctions. The option of sanctioning will be effective when a participant is close in social space to co-savers who have yet to receive funding, but will not have teeth when the contracting parties are distant in social space. Furthermore, sanctioning will be more effective when a participant wants to keep open the option of “re-ROCSA-ing.” In the “grand” scheme of things, this implies that participation in a ROSCA in a given point in time is not a final event, not the last act in a sequence of moves; rather, it is a stage in a process, part of a broader, lasting, and dynamic relationship. (Recall footnote 2.) This line of reasoning can be taken a step further. Suppose that people in a village who seek to form a ROSCA and who want to lower the likelihood of “default” differ in the likelihood that they will want to re-enter ROSCAs. Then, if people with a low likelihood team up with other people of low likelihood, and people with high such likelihood team up with people of high likelihood, the overall incidence of default will be lower than if people with low likelihood team up with people with high likelihood, and people with high likelihood team up with people with low likelihood.====A third reason relates to the frequency with which the participants receive their income (Anderson et al., 2009). To see this, suppose that the size of a ROSCA “pot” is fixed and is equal to the cost of the good to be acquired, which is 12 pesos, and that a ROSCA of four members will have a weekly rotation that matches the points in time at which the members receive incomes (with weekly contributions equal to 4, and as per our example above, four rotations to completion). If instead a ROSCA of five members is contemplated, members will not be able to increase the frequency of the rotation, thus not exhausting the potential to maximize the gain from increased membership.====Whether a ROSCA is formed endogenously (by the participants) or exogenously (by entities such as charities and commercial banks that offer savings accounts that mimic a ROSCA arrangement), we assume that the creators are benevolent in the sense that their aim is to maximize the participants' gain. In particular, in concert with the basic notion of time preferences, they all seek to minimize the expected waiting time for receiving the “pot.” Clearly, participation in a ROSCA shortens the waiting period to obtain the desired good for all the participants except for the last one who, anyhow, does not wait longer than if saving alone.====People resort to participation in a ROSCA because if they do not, the benefit (welfare gain) from mastering the funds needed to install, implement, acquire and so on is delayed. The raison d'être of participation is to gain time, to expedite. Given this, what architecture will ==== best deliver it? The first order and natural statistic to use is the expected mean. This is the measure that we use. Imagine that we visit a village and meet people who fit the preceding description, and who have already formed a ROSCA. If we find that the number of participants is lower than the optimum, then we will recommend adding new members. For scholars who study the formation and functioning of informal financial institutions, we provide a rigorously derived rule for limiting the size of these institutions. However, if ROSCAs were to function merely as a mechanism that facilitates saving, then there would be no reason for their special design; people could deposit, say with the village elder, some funds, and at a future point in time the accumulated sum will be divided between them.====In this paper we draw on the intuition behind the third reason discussed above. We conduct a formal analysis showing how the “discreteness” of the frequency of ROSCA rotations feeds into the optimal size of the membership of a ROSCA.==== What we show, which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported before, is that an optimal size of a ROSCA exists, that it is (relatively) limited, and that it is a multiple of the number of time periods that it takes an individual to save on his own. Our result is far from being “relatively obvious:” to us, instinctively, it would seem that if we were to neglect management costs and moral hazard considerations, then larger ROSCAs would generally be more efficient due to scale.==== Establishing the existence of an optimal size is then counterintuitive, and proving this existence was not done before.====The financial architecture that we study in this paper is a random ROSCA. Our study is not an all-encompassing study of all types ROSCAs. We do know that random ROSCAs are prevalent, and frequent. For example, Kedir and Ibrahim (2011) find that random ROSCAs are the common type of a ROSCA in Ethiopia. In the sample of Kenyan ROSCAs studied by Gugerty (2007), a large fraction of ROSCAs (42%) are random, while in the Kenyan sample of Anderson et al. (2009), 29% of the ROSCAs are random. According to Rutherford (2001), most of the ROSCAs in Bangladesh are of the random type.====We assume that the participants in a given ROSCA have a similar need, save in a similar manner, and are allocated the “pot” in the same manner. This is the reference setting that we study. In reality needs can differ, the ability to set aside a given sum on a regular basis can differ, and “pot” allocations can be governed not by a draw but, rather, by bidding where the participants bid competitively for the “pot” which is then given to the highest bidder, or allocations can be guided by considerations such as need, age, and compassion. (When the latter, then a ROSCA also assumes the role of an insurance provider.) To the extent that heterogeneity in need and the ability to save can interfere with the smooth functioning of ROSCAs and detract from their stability, we would expect the formation of several ROSCAs in a given village, each with a considerable degree of homogeneity rather than the formation of mixed ROSCAs. Women who save towards buying a cow will form one ROSCA, men who save for the installation of a tube well will form another ROSCA. All in all, our paper does not strive to be a Handbook of ROSCAs. We focus on a case of considerable homogeneity and uniformity which, as we state repeatedly, is not only an appropriate characterization or approximation of a good part of reality; it is also the basis for the construction of a plethora of ROSCA architectures. Particularly because of this, the attributes of the type of case that we study need to be fleshed out and ascertained rigorously. And the methodology and criteria that we develop can serve as a foundation for the study of other cases.====Our findings wield major consequences for the design of ROSCAs. An idea that could come to mind is to exploit the effect of scale to increase the efficiency of ROSCAs: if we were to sufficiently reduce the cost of management (monitoring, enforcement, and other transaction costs) and the temptation to default, then a large ROSCA would be deemed more efficient than a smaller one. However, what we show is that even if the cost of management was negligible and the moral hazard was eliminated entirely, increasing the size of ROSCA beyond the optimum will not be beneficial to the participants.",On the optimal size of a joint savings association,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759672200021X,26 May 2022,2022,Research Article,54.0

The data contain multidimensional information about patent counts and citations, which, together with an identification strategy based on Lu et al. (2017), allows us to measure innovation comprehensively and to uncover the causal relationship. Our empirical analysis shows that FDI has positive intra-industry effects on the quantity and quality of innovation, as well as radical innovation, by Chinese firms. We show that these positive effects are driven by increases in competition, rather than by knowledge spillovers from FDI which is measured by patent citations between domestic firms and foreign invested enterprises (FIEs). We further investigate the inter-industry effects of FDI and find that FDI has positive vertical effects on innovation in upstream sectors through backward knowledge spillovers.","One of the kernel intentions for developing countries to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) is to promote the growth of domestic industries by absorbing foreign investors’ advanced technology. A considerable body of research has examined FDI’s impact on productivity in developing countries, finding some evidence that the presence of FDI indeed facilitates technology transfer through spillovers and enhancements of domestic firms’ productivity (e.g., Blomström and Sjöholm, 1999; Javorcik, 2004; Kugler, 2006; Blalock and Gertler, 2008; Burstein and Monge-Naranjo, 2009; Fons-Rosen et al., 2021).==== The long-term productivity growth of a country, however, depends also on the innovation of its domestic firms. Innovation will become increasingly important for many developing countries as they grow further and narrow the gap with the developed world (e.g., Chen and Puttitanum, 2005). With the continued rise of foreign direct investment to developing countries, an important question for both economists and policy makers is: How will FDI impact the innovation of host-country firms?====From a theoretical perspective, the influx of FDI may either positively or negatively impact domestic firms’ innovation: while the potential knowledge spillover from advanced foreign firms is likely beneficial, the business stealing effect of increased competition may reduce domestic firms’ innovation (e.g., Aghion et al., 2005; Bloom et al., 2019). Empirical research on the relationship between FDI and innovation is relatively sparse. The few existing studies for developed countries have produced mixed results.==== Studies for developing countries have focused on China (Hu and Jefferson, 2009; Cheung and Lin, 2004; Zhang, 2017; Jiang et al., 2021). As the largest developing country, China has in the past few decades experienced large increases in both FDI and innovation (Fig. 1), providing a natural setting for research that has broad implications for developing countries. These studies find a positive relationship between FDI and innovation in China, but their measurement of innovation is largely limited to patent counts and lacks quality metrics that account for the heterogeneity in patent quality. More importantly, these studies primarily contain correlation results, without adequately addressing potential problems associated with omitted variables and reverse causality. This issue is especially concerning in light of the surprising finding of Lu et al. (2017). Using a novel identification strategy, Lu et al. (2017) find evidence that inward FDI negatively impacts Chinese firms’ productivity. One wonders whether FDI may also negatively affect Chinese firms’ innovation once the causal relationship is identified.====This paper conducts an empirical study of inward FDI’s impact on Chinese firms’ innovation, using new firm-level matched data on firms’ operations and patents in China.==== The newly available data set on patent applications by Chinese firms allows us to construct comprehensive measures of firms’ innovation quantity and quality, including patent counts and patent citations, using the methodology in the innovation literature (e.g., Hall et al., 2001, 2005). Following the identification strategy put forward by Lu et al. (2017), we further construct an instrument for FDI that utilizes a plausibly exogenous change of FDI regulations in China, the revisions to the ==== in 2002. We are then able to compare firms’ innovation performance between the treatment group (i.e., FDI-encouraged industries) and the control group (i.e., FDI-unchanged industries) before and after the changes in FDI regulation. Our research thus overcomes the two main difficulties in the existing studies on FDI and innovation, namely the comprehensive measurement of innovation and the identification of a causal relationship.====We find positive intra-industry effects of FDI on firms’ innovation quantity and quality, measured respectively by the number of patents and by patent citations (number, generality, and originality). Moreover, the positive impact of FDI appears to be more pronounced for more important innovations (i.e., for invention patents than for utility model and design patents). Further evidence backs up these positive effects when considering “radical innovation”. The results remain valid with respect to various robustness tests, such as controlling for the patent stimulation policies and using alternative measures of FDI. The comprehensive data further allow us to examine the possible mechanisms for FDI’s effects. In particular, based on the patent citations made by domestic firms to foreign invested enterprises (FIEs), we construct a direct measurement of knowledge spillover from FDI, and we quantify competition intensity not only through market concentration but also through a measure of technology competition using the patent data. We find evidence that the influx of FDI intensifies market competition and pressures domestic firms in the same industry to innovate for technological upgrades, leading to an overall positive impact, but no evidence of a significant horizontal knowledge spillover effect of FDI on firm innovation. This is surprising, in contrast to the finding of Lu et al. (2017) that FDI has an overall negative impact on firm productivity because of the negative competition effect.====Increased competition due to FDI can either stimulate or hinder innovation (Aghion et al., 2005). On the one hand, the stronger competition following foreign entry may motivate domestic firms to increase innovation in order to stay ahead of the competitors, which is the escape-competition effect. On the other hand, the entry of foreign competitors may decrease the market share of domestic firms, reducing their profits from—and hence incentives for—innovation, which is the business-stealing effect. Our findings suggest that the escape-competition effect plays a dominant role in determining the impact of FDI on domestic firms’ innovation. However, Lu et al. (2017) find that FDI negatively impacts the domestic firms’ productivity, which suggests that the business-stealing effect dominates. The competition effect of FDI for innovation and for productivity can thus be very different, which may explain the different intra-industry effects of FDI on innovation and productivity for Chinese firms.==== Furthermore, we find that the effects of FDI on innovation are heterogenous across different types of domestic firms. Specifically, the positive effects of FDI are weaker for larger firms, for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and for joint venture enterprises. In addition, we find that both local FDI and non-local FDI affect innovation positively, and that FDI from HMT (Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) regions has a smaller impact on firm innovation than from non-HMT regions. Moreover, FDI exerts positive effects on both the level and growth rate of innovation.====FDI can also potentially affect innovation through vertical linkages. We find that the presence of FDI in downstream sectors has positive effects on the innovation of firms in the upstream industries, whereas the presence of FDI in upstream sectors has negative effects on the innovation of downstream firms. The literature has suggested that vertical knowledge spillover is a major source of the vertical effects of FDI on productivity (Javorcik, 2004; Javorcik and Spatareanu, 2008; Blalock and Gertler, 2008), but it does not separately identify the knowledge spillover. Our comprehensive patent data allow us to construct direct measures of both backward and forward knowledge spillovers, based on the patent citation network. We demonstrate that there are significant knowledge spillovers through backward but not forward linkages, which, together with other factors in vertical relations, provide explanations to the different effects of backward and forward FDI on Chinese firms’ innovation.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background and also describes the data for our study. Section 3 presents the identification strategy and the underlying assumptions. Section 4 reports the main empirical results on the (intra-industry) effects of FDI on innovation, explains the results by analyzing the potential competition and knowledge spillover mechanisms, and further examines the heterogeneity of the innovation effects of FDI. Section 5 conducts additional analysis, using various controls and considering alternative assumptions, to confirm the robustness of our main results. Section 6 examines the vertical effects of FDI and the underlying mechanisms of backward vs. forward knowledge spillovers.

China’s family planning policies in the early 1970s – before the One-Child Policy – regulated not only childbirth but also marriage. The recommended minimum marriage age of 25 years for men and 23 years for women was effectively relaxed when the government formally introduced the One-Child Policy and put greater emphasis on directly controlling fertility rather than marriage. Subsequently, we find that the marriage age, which had been increasing steadily since 1970, suddenly started to decline in the early 1980s. This policy shift provides us with an opportunity to apply a regression probability jump and kink design for the purpose of identification. Using data from the 2000 census, we establish that later-married men have fewer children and that later-married women are more likely to participate in the labor market. We find no consistent evidence that later marriage improves education, probably because most Chinese people marry after completing their education.","People all over the world are getting married later. According to the 2020 World’s Women Report (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division, 2020), the mean age at first marriage increased for both women and men in all regions, with few exceptions. Globally, during the 1995–2015 period, the mean age at first marriage rose from 22.5 years to 23.3 years for women and from 25.6 years to 26.8 years for men.==== Therefore, understanding the long-term consequences of later marriage is an important empirical question. However, it is a challenging one because the timing of marriage is an endogenous variable associated with a wide range of socio-economic factors, such as educational attainment (Ikamari, 2005, Zha, 2019), economic prospects (Cherlin, 1980, Oppenheimer, 1988, Bergstrom and Schoeni, 1996, Gutiérrez-Domènech, 2008, Gibson-Davis, 2009), family structure (Peter et al., 2018), and demographic changes (Yu and Xie, 2015, Porter, 2016, Bronson and Mazzocco, 2018). We contribute to the literature by establishing a causal effect of later marriage on subsequent life outcomes by exploiting changes in the late-marriage regulations as a result of a shift in China’s family planning policies, which generated dramatic kinks (slope change) with small jumps (level change) in marriage age across birth cohorts.====The existing literature on China’s family planning policies has disproportionally focused on the fertility restrictions of the One-Child Policy (OCP), which was formally introduced in January 1980. However, the OCP is a subset of China’s family planning policies during a particular period. In the early 1970s, before the enforcement of the OCP, China’s family planning policies took the form of the “later (marriage), longer (intervals), fewer (children)” (LLF, or ====) campaign (Chen and Huang, 2020).==== The “later (marriage)” part of the policy regulated the timing of marriage: the recommended minimum marriage age was 25 years for men and 23 years for women. Despite imperfect enforcement, the average age at first marriage increased steadily from 23 years in 1971 to 24.6 years in 1979 for men, and from 20.5 years to 22.8 years for women over the same period. This rising trend was suddenly reversed in 1980 when the OCP came into effect (Fig. 1): the average age at first marriage dropped to 23.3 years for men and 21.5 years for women in 1985.==== Our paper focuses on the shift in the late-marriage regulations and explores how they affected the timing of first marriage and post-marriage outcomes, including fertility, education, and labor-force participation.====Using data from China’s 2000 population census and adopting a regression probability jump and kink (RPJK) strategy that combines a regression discontinuity design with a regression kink design, we observe that (1) the relaxation of the late-marriage requirements resulted in young couples getting married earlier, (2) men marrying later on average have fewer children, and (3) women marrying later are more likely to participate in the labor force. We find suggestive evidence that improved intra-household bargaining position is one potential mechanism that accounts for the causal effect of later marriage. This finding is consistent with the literature showing that later childbirth benefits women’s labor-market performance through the channel of higher human capital (Blackburn et al., 1993, Miller, 2011).====Our study contributes to two strands of literature. The first examines the causal effects of later marriage. Several studies use the menarche age as the instrumental variable to examine the causality of delayed marriage on women’s schooling outcomes, social attitudes, health, bargaining power, and political engagement (Field and Ambrus, 2008, Asadullah and Wahhaj, 2019, Hicks and Hicks, 2019, Carpena and Jensenius, 2021). The use of the menarche-age instrument is limited to women in patriarchal societies, who face strong social pressures to marry upon menarche. In a study of the United States, Wang and Wang (2017) employ state-by-year variations in the legal minimum marriage age to construct an instrumental variable for marriage age. Using the 1980 U.S. census, they find a positive effect of marriage delay on wages, with a larger effect for women, and suggest that the causal effects are almost exclusively achieved through increased education. However, since minimum legal ages are primarily set in the teenage years, very few Americans marry immediately upon reaching the minimum marriage age. We propose a novel approach to identifying the causal effect of later marriage on Chinese youths in their twenties (rather than teenagers)—an age period that is closer to the world average age for first marriage (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division, 2020).====The second strand of literature investigates the effect of China’s family planning policies before the OCP. We acknowledge that our first marginal contribution (identifying the causal effect of later marriage) faces an external validity issue because the policy and economic environment of China is special in many aspects. However, highlighting the marital restriction during the LLF period and its subsequent relaxation in the OCP period is sufficiently important on its own because it helps to understand the historical transition of marriage patterns in China. Most existing studies focus on the effect of the OCP on various outcomes,==== while the studies that focus on pre-OCP policies (including the LLF policy) are much fewer. Scharping (2003) and Whyte et al. (2015) stress the importance of the LLF policy in reducing the fertility rate. Several studies focus on the consequences of the “fewer (children)” part of the “later, longer, fewer” policy bundle.==== However, the LLF policy imposed restrictions not only on the number of children but also on the timing of marriage. Our paper is among the few studies that focus on the marriage restriction component of China’s family planning policies.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background of China’s family planning policies and explains why the switch from the LLF policy to the OCP generated a kink in the marriage age. Section 3 describes our empirical strategy, data, and main variables. Section 4 presents the main results and explores the potential mechanisms of later marriage.

Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates indicate that late enrollment in primary school lowers years of education, earnings, wage rate, and probability of employment. However, when we use the within-monozygotic (MZ)-twin fixed effects method to exclude unobservable endowments and family factors, the effects of SSA on years of education become less negative. For earnings, wage rate, and the probability of employment, the within-twin fixed effects estimates become insignificant. The results indicate that a one-year delay in primary school starting age lowers schooling by 0.51 years but does not affect earnings, wage rate, or probability of employment. The difference between OLS and within-MZ-twin fixed effects estimates indicates that the negative return to SSA is due to unobservable family variables and omitted individual-specific endowments. We further find that the earlier primary school starters fail to obtain a level of education with high return. Specifically, early birds do not have a high probability of getting a vocational school degree or above.","“The early bird catches the worm” is a famous saying among Chinese parents. This ==== belief stimulates competition in terms of the human capital investment by Chinese parents, beginning at the child’s birth. Unlike parents in the United States, who tend to send their children to primary school at an older age (Bedard and Dhuey, 2006), Chinese parents prefer early enrollment in formal schooling. To enable their children to gain an advantage from early enrollment in primary school, given the school entry cutoff date, Chinese parents prefer to give birth in late August rather than early September (Huang et al., 2020).==== However, whether the early bird indeed catches the worm is unclear.====This study investigates the effect of primary school starting age (SSA) on long-run outcomes using data from the Chinese Adult Twins Survey (CATS). Long-run outcomes include educational attainment, earnings, wage rate, and the probability of employment. Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates indicate that starting school at a young age increases years of schooling. Furthermore, when we eliminate unobservable family factors and individual genetic elements using the within-twin fixed effects method, we corroborate that SSA has a less negative effect on years of schooling than OLS estimates (–0.51 vs. –1.18). Family background and individual endowments amplify the negative impact of SSA on educational attainment. Concerning labor market outcomes, OLS estimates for log monthly earnings, log wage rate, and the probability of employment suggest that SSA has adverse effects on these outcomes. However, within-twin fixed effects estimates are insignificant. The comparison between OLS estimates and within-twin fixed effects estimates indicates that there exists a selection of earlier starters across different families and individual-specific endowments. Children with better family background and/or better endowments are more likely to attend school earlier. The negative and significant effects of SSA on labor market outcomes by OLS are mostly driven by family factors and omitted individual-specific abilities. We further investigate why SSA does not affect labor market outcomes, whereas a one-year delay in starting primary school lowers 0.51 years of schooling. We find that the earlier primary school starters fail to obtain a level of education with high return, such as vocational school, college or above. Earlier primary school starters are more likely to get a junior high school degree but not for high school degree or above.====Extensive literature documents the short- and long-run effects of SSA. Short-run outcomes include cognitive tests (Pellizzari and Billari, 2012, Zhang et al., 2017), school tests for each grade or academic performance in university (Bedard and Dhuey, 2006, Mcewan and Shapiro, 2008, Muhlenweg and Puhani, 2010, Kawaguchi, 2011, Elder and Lubotsky, 2015), and IQ tests (Black et al., 2011). Long-run outcomes include educational attainment, earnings, and the probability of employment (Black et al., 2011, Fredriksson and Ockert, 2014). Other outcomes are juvenile propensity to commit a crime (Landersø et al., 2017, Depew and Eren, 2016); teenage pregnancy (Black et al., 2011); and mental health (Dee and Sievertsen, 2018).====However, no consensus regarding the benefits and costs of starting primary school earlier has been reached. Several studies show that higher SSA benefits students in test grades and educational attainment (Bedard and Dhuey, 2006, Fredriksson and Ockert, 2014). The estimated effects of SSA on in-school performance indicate that older starters perform better on school tests. However, these results are difficult to interpret as pure effects of SSA. Individuals who start school late are also older when the tests are administered. Thus, those studies fail to distinguish the effects of SSA and the age at test-taking (Deming and Dynarski, 2008). On the other hand, some studies using data from China found negative effects of SSA on cognitive test scores and high school enrollment rates (Zhang et al., 2017, Chen and Park, 2021). One issue raised by Huang et al. (2020) is the selection bias of parents. Highly educated mothers are likely to schedule birth early (in late August rather than early September) and thus can send their children to primary school at a younger age. Thus, earlier starters may be those with better socioeconomic family backgrounds. This finding undermines the assumption of the regression discontinuity design (RDD) method, which is commonly used in studying the effect of SSA on various outcomes by exploiting the rule for school entry cutoff date.====Our study applies within-twin variation in SSA to capture exogenous variation. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use twin data to study this issue. Using twin data to study the effect of SSA on long-run outcomes has several advantages. First, we can eliminate the effects of family factors, including the family’s unobservable background; previous literature suggests that SSA does not have the same effects for individuals from different family backgrounds.==== These studies simply divide children into two or three groups based on their parents’ education or family income to examine how the effect of SSA varies with family background. However, these studies fail to exclude unobservable family factors. Twin data enable us to overcome this problem. Twin siblings are born into a family and share the same family background. By taking the first difference between twins, we can eliminate family factors in the regression equation. Thus, within-twin fixed effects estimates are less biased by unobservable family factors. Furthermore, we can infer how family factors bias the effects of SSA on the outcomes by comparing OLS estimates and within-twin fixed effects estimates.====Second, twin data enable us to exclude individual-specific endowments. Black et al. (2011) suggest that the estimated SSA effects partly reflect the endowment differences among students when school starts. However, measuring original endowments is not easy. Black et al. use a within-siblings fixed effects method to exclude bias because of family backgrounds and genes. Given that siblings have the same parents, they share a large part of their genomes and are likely to be raised in the same style. However, this method has two disadvantages. First, siblings do not have identical genes. Second, the family background may change over time. For instance, parental income may change between siblings’ births. The monozygotic twins (MZ or identical twins) used in this paper enables us to address this problem. MZ twins are separated from one fertilized egg and share the same family background and genes. By taking the first difference between MZ twins, we can eliminate unobservable endowments in the regression equation. The effects of SSA on outcomes estimated by a within-twin fixed effects method are less biased due to unobservable endowments than OLS estimates.====Third, we take advantage of dizygotic (DZ or nonidentical) twins to check whether within-twin fixed effects estimates for MZ twins have a remaining bias due to endowments. DZ twins are cultivated from two fertilized eggs and have fewer similar genes than MZ twins. Thus, the first difference between DZ twins does not eliminate unobservable endowments completely. Estimates using the within-DZ-twin fixed effects method may be biased due to the remaining unobservable endowments. By comparing the within-DZ twin fixed effects estimates with the within-MZ-twin fixed effects estimates, we can infer whether endowments play a role in the effects of SSA on outcomes.====Last, the estimated effects of SSA using the within-twin fixed effects method are distinguished from the effect of age. Given that twins have the same age, our estimates are not mixed.====The study’s contributions are threefold. First, the estimated effect of SSA using twin data eliminates bias due to family background and genes. Within-twin fixed effects estimates of SSA on years of schooling are less negative than OLS estimates.====Second, our finding that SSA has a negative effect on years of schooling emphasizes the importance of peer effects. Black et al. (2011) suggest that younger students in a class may benefit from being surrounded by older and more able peers, which is known as the peer effect. On the other hand, early starters may not be mature enough to understand complicated information. Later starters perhaps learn more effectively at a certain age, and being the oldest in the class may give an early advantage. This is known as the relative maturity effect. If the maturity effect is persistent over time, then SSA has a positive impact on years of schooling, as found by Fredriksson and Ockert (2014) and Kawaguchi (2011). However, several studies have shown that the relative maturity effect fades with age (Datar and Gottfried, 2015, Elder and Lubotsky, 2015). If the peer effect dominates the relative maturity effect, then SSA has a negative effect on years of schooling. Our finding that SSA has a negative effect on years of schooling indicates that the peer effect dominates the relative maturity effect.====Third, our finding provides new explanations for why SSA does not affect earnings. Fredriksson and Ockert (2014) propose that the effect of SSA on earnings is marginal and ambiguous because of the trade-off between return to education and working experience. Dobkin and Ferreira (2010) contend that the increase in education attainment offsets the poor academic performance of children who start primary school early. Black et al. (2011) find that the negative effect of SSA on earnings fades with time. The effect of age at school starting on earnings is negative until age 30, but lessens when individuals are over 35 years old. In this paper, OLS estimates indicate that SSA is negatively correlated with log monthly earnings. However, within-twin fixed effects estimates decrease to zero. The comparison between OLS estimates and within-twin fixed effects estimates for MZ twins illuminates the selection of SSA across the family background and individual endowments. Children with better family backgrounds and/or with better endowments are likely to start primary school earlier. The significant OLS estimates of SSA on earnings are due to the selection effect. When we exclude family background and endowments in the estimation, the estimates of the effect of SSA on earnings are insignificant. The unobserved family background and endowments contribute to the significant OLS estimates.====We apply the within-twin difference in SSA to study this issue. Although the survey does not ask why twins start school at different ages, twin siblings may start primary school at different ages. In Section 4.4, we discuss some conjectures on why twins start primary school at different ages and perform several checks to exclude some possible factors that affect the SSAs of the twin siblings.====We examine whether birth order, birth weight and unobserved endowment affect the SSAs of twin siblings. First, we find that the birth order is not associated with the SSA of MZ twins. The average SSA of the old twin is not different from that of the young twin. The birth order does not contribute to the early starting of primary school. Second, the within-twin difference in SSA is negative and insignificantly correlated with birth weight for MZ twins. The twin siblings with a heavier birth weight do not start primary school earlier. Third, we exclude one possible channel that may make the estimates less accurate: the better-endowed twin sibling may attend school early. By comparing within-twin fixed effects estimates for MZ twins with those for DZ twins, we find that twin siblings with better endowments start school earlier. However, this result is statistically insignificant.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the empirical strategy. We describe the Chinese Adult Twins Survey in Section 3.

However, increasing incentives will increase the costs of uncertainty if local government officials are risk averse. Building on the insights of the classic principal-agent models, we predict that the optimal share of tax revenues retained by local government will decrease as the uncertainty of total tax revenues increases. Using Chinese provincial data, we find a robust negative relationship between volatility and the tax-sharing ratio at the sub-provincial level. Our results indicate that optimal decentralization in developing countries balances the trade-off between risk and incentives.","Over the past few decades, many countries have embraced greater fiscal decentralization. Some countries only pass spending authority down to local governments while others also provide localities with a considerable share of tax revenue (Gadenne and Singhal, 2014; Shah, 2006). The devolution of spending authority is largely motivated by the belief that local officials have better access to local information, while assigning a larger share of tax revenue to local governments is often thought to promote more business-friendly policies and, consequently, better economic performance. That is, if the local government can keep a significant portion of the increased tax revenue generated in their jurisdiction, they will have strong fiscal incentives to invest in business-promoting infrastructure, to limit costly regulations, and to curb the solicitation of bribes by local officials. This has been a central argument of the second-generation theory of fiscal federalism (for reviews, see Oates, 2008; Weingast, 2009).====However, greater incentives will increase the cost of uncertainty if local government officials are risk averse. According to the classic principal-agent models, there is a trade-off between risk and incentives (Holmström, 1979; Holmström and Milgrom, 1987; Stiglitz, 1974). A risk-neutral principal is expected to hedge risk-averse agents by offering them contracts with less performance-related compensation and more fixed compensation when the relationship between effort and output is more violate. The trade-off between risk and incentives may also hold between central (the principals) and local (the agents) governments. Both central and local government officials care about fiscal revenues, but the central government can largely bear revenue shortfalls by issuing national debt, thus are largely risk neutral, while local governments are often faced with balanced budget constraints, thus are more risk averse. Therefore, if the central government allocates a larger share of tax revenue to local governments and, thus, fewer fixed transfers, it will provide stronger fiscal incentives for local officials to promote economic growth; however, this will also increase the risks local governments face. Consistent with the classical theory, we thus predict that the optimal share of tax revenues retained by local government decreases as the uncertainty of tax revenues increases.====We test this prediction empirically using Chinese data. China provides a particularly appropriate institutional setting to test our key proposition. First, China has a system of tax sharing, where governments at different levels each receive a share of the revenues from particular national taxes collected in each jurisdiction.==== Unlike most federal systems, local governments in China do not have the authority to legislate and collect taxes themselves. For major taxes, different levels of government share the tax revenue instead of levying their own taxes. Second, higher levels of government set the revenue-sharing rules for their subordinate levels of government. Although the central government determines a uniform revenue-sharing rule for all 31 Mainland provinces, the provincial governments in China have been granted substantial discretion in determining their own tax-sharing rules for their respective prefectures, which has given rise to substantial variation in sub-provincial treatment. For example, in Zhejiang Province, the tax-sharing ratio at the sub-provincial level (including prefecture, county, and township governments) was 66% in 2016, while it was 36% in Jilin Province. Furthermore, the tax-sharing ratio varies not only across province but also across time. This variation enables us to test empirically whether the retained revenue share of sub-provincial governments is negatively related to province-specific revenue volatility. Third, over 90% of China's tax revenue is levied on firms rather than individuals. The tax revenue that a local government can retain (such as a value-added tax or corporate income tax) depends greatly on local economic growth. Thus, a higher revenue retention rate will strongly encourage local governments to stimulate local economic growth in order to expand the tax base. Fourth, in Chinese political institutions, lower-level government leaders are appointed by higher-level officials rather than being elected by the residents; thus, they prioritize fiscal revenue over demands for social services from citizens. The single-task feature of local government makes fiscal incentives very important in encouraging them to promote economic growth. Previous literature has long argued that the high share of revenue retained by subnational governments in China helped to align the incentives of government authorities with economic efficiency, which explains China's phenomenal growth after the 1980s (Jin et al., 2005). By contrast, if local government officials were elected by citizens, they would be accountable to their constituencies and care less about fiscal revenue; in this case, the fiscal incentives provided by larger revenue share would be less important, as the agents would have too many goals. Finally, local governments in China faced with balanced budget constraints before 2015,==== thus they are highly risk averse. Therefore, too higher revenue retention rate will also make local governments at higher risk. By contrast, the central or provincial government is more likely to be risk neutral, since they can smooth city-specific idiosyncratic risks, and it can more easily to borrow debt.====In our empirical analysis, we test whether higher provincial tax revenue volatility leads to lower tax-sharing ratios at the sub-provincial level using province-level panel data from 1999 to 2016. Since there is no major tax reform in this period, the variation of province-year-level tax revenue volatility primarily stems from the variation of province-year-level tax base volatility. Since provinces differ in industrial structure and each industry has specific trend along with national economic cycles, province-year-level tax base volatility has much variation both across provinces and over time. Exploiting this variation, we find that sub-provincial tax sharing ratio is negatively associated with both revenue volatility and GDP volatility. However, the volatility of tax revenue at the province level, may still be endogeneous. With a higher revenue retention rate, local governments will have larger incentives to take measures to promote economic growth. Such measures may make total GDP and revenue fluctuate less sharply.==== To solve the endogeneity problem, we employ a Bartik shift-share instrumental variable approach (Bartik, 1991). The instrument is constructed as follows. First, we calculate the proportion of tax revenue of sector j in province i in the total revenue of province i in 1994 as the initial tax structure. Second, we obtain the national tax revenue volatility for each sector j from 1999 to 2016. Finally, we obtain the Bartik instrument by interacting the province's initial tax structure and the national revenue volatility for each sector. The results of the instrumental variable regression show a robust negative relationship between volatility and tax-sharing ratio at the sub-provincial level.====We notice that our empirical finding is consistent with the statement of some government decrees. When considering the tax sharing between provincial and sub-provincial governments, provincial governments do consider the trade-off between risk and incentive. Guo Shuqing, the Governor of Shandong Province, reformed Shandong's tax sharing system in 2013. At the Shandong Annual Conference on Fiscal Affairs in 2013, he said that “rationalize intergovernmental allocation of fiscal revenue between provincial and sub-provincial governments, and establish a fiscal system that different levels of government can share both benefits and risks”====. The government decree of the reform also points out two major principles of the 2013 reform, one is “strengthen incentives, promote development”, the other is “share both benefits and risks” .====This paper contributes to three strands of literature. First, the literature on fiscal federalism has focused on the incentives of local governments since the 1980s. Revenue-sharing rules have been an important scheme for shaping fiscal incentives (Oates, 2008; Weingast, 2009). Jin et al. (2005) and Han and Kung (2015) find that a greater revenue-retention ratio can encourage local governments to enact pro-business policies, using subnational level data from China, while Zhuravskaya (2000) finds that the low revenue-retention ratio in Russia explains in part why local governments have few incentives to provide public goods and attract private business. However, the literature has overlooked an important cost of higher revenue-sharing ratios: the trade-off between risk and incentives. We show that the volatility of tax revenue is an important constraint on increasing fiscal local governments’ incentives. In recent years, many international agencies such as the World Bank have proposed that the central government in developing countries should allocate a larger share of tax revenue to local governments to provide stronger fiscal incentives for local officials to promote economic growth. However, too much decentralization could also increase the risks faced by local governments, especially given that revenue volatility is often very high in developing countries.====Since Musgrave (1983) put out the famous question “Who Should Tax, Where and What?” in what he called ""multilevel finance"", standard fiscal federalism theory has suggested that only benefit taxes (such as property tax and user charges) should be assigned to subnational governments (Oates, 1999). However, in practice, tax assignment in many countries deviates from this standard theory (Bird, 2009). Some countries adopt a tax-sharing system, and assign a considerable share of fiscal revenue to subnational government. Our study complements this literature by showing the trade-off between incentives and insurance in shaping optimal revenue decentralization.====Second, our study is among the few that empirically investigate the determinants of fiscal decentralization. Although there is considerable literature on examining the outcomes of fiscal decentralization (Gadenne and Singhal, 2014; Mookherjee, 2015; Treisman, 2007); however, only a few studies have empirically examined the factors that determine the extent of decentralization. Previous studies have investigated whether increased preference heterogeneity leads to a higher level of expenditure decentralization, which is a key prediction from Oates’ (1972) famous decentralization theorem. For example, Panizza (1999) and Arzaghi and Henderson (2005) find that fiscal decentralization is positively correlated with country size and ethnic fractionalization. Strumpf and Oberholzer-Gee (2002) show that states with more heterogeneous preferences are more likely to decentralize liquor control and allow for local government decision-making in the United States. However, none studies have empirically investigated the determinants of revenue decentralization in intergovernmental fiscal relations.====Third, we contribute to the organization theory literature. Previous studies have empirically examined whether the trade-off between incentives and risk holds within firms (Baker and Jorgensen, 2003; Edmans and Gabaix, 2011; Prendergast, 2002; Zabojnik, 1996); however, the results have been inconclusive. Our evidence indicates that the classical trade-off between risk and incentives also holds within government organizations. As noted above, in the Chinese institutional milieu where local governments are single-targeted, the risk–incentives trade-off is more likely to hold.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Using firm-product-level data with product quantities and prices, we analyze the role of product specialization and show that the prominent “extended work bench hypothesis” cannot explain these sustained productivity differences. Eastern firms specialize in simpler product varieties generating less consumer value and being manufactured with less or cheaper inputs. Yet, such specialization cannot explain the productivity gap because Eastern firms are physically less productive for given product prices. Hence, there is a genuine price-adjusted physical productivity disadvantage of Eastern compared to Western firms.====: D24, L11, L2, O47","After the fall of the iron curtain and German unification in 1990==== it became apparent that the former centrally planned East-German economy (henceforth, GDR for German Democratic Republic) could not compete in a market economy facing world market prices (Akerlof et al., 1991; Collier and Siebert 1991). Based on GDR data, Akerlof et al. (1991) estimate that only about 10 percent of the former GDR's workforce were employed at firms viable at world market prices. When West German dominated labor unions and employer associations agreed on raising East German wages by about 40 percent over the course of 1990, many East German firms had to lay off the majority of their workers or to close entirely. During 1990–1991, the East German economy experienced a breakdown unprecedented in modern economic history: it lost about one third of GDP and non-employment rose from zero to 30 percent.====While the dramatic magnitude of the breakdown of the East German economy came as a surprise for many observers, it was still believed that, once state-of-the-art machinery had been installed and production patterns had been adjusted to world market standards, East Germany would continuously catch up to the West. And indeed, already in 1991, the former GDR reached about 40 percent of West German GDP per worker and, until the mid-1990s; East Germany sharply increased its GDP per worker reaching about two thirds of the West German productivity level (see Fig. 1).====However, after this initial success, convergence slowed down considerably. Despite massive and sustained state aid, the East German economy was largely unable to attract or create headquarters of global players and the innovation activity of private firms falls short of West German levels.==== Even 30 years after the German reunification, East Germany's GDP per worker is 20 percent below the West German level.====How can we explain the persistent East-West productivity gap given the shared institutional setting and free factor mobility between both regions? The literature is far from providing an answer to this question. Existing research shows that East Germany is endowed with human capital comparable to West German standards (Burda and Hunt 2001) or even outperforms the West in formal educational levels (Kluge and Weber 2018). As physical capital intensity is higher in the East, too (Burda and Severgnini 2018), explanations for the persistent GDP per capita gap must focus on manifested regional differences in revenue TFP (Burda and Hunt 2001). Only a few papers have questioned whether the substantial differences in revenue productivity between both regions really mirror differences in physical productivity or differences in output prices and specialization patterns (e.g. Burda and Hunt 2001, Paqué 2009). Based on granular ten-digit product data, our study is first in exploring systematically East-West differences in prices and product portfolios as an alternative explanation for the gap in revenue productivity.====Aggregate productivity differences due to differences in aggregate prices between both regions may result from firms specializing in manufacturing products from different positions of the value chain (vertical specialization), and a first common hypothesis we test is that East German productivity is hampered because, similar to other post-communist regions in Eastern Europe, it (still) serves as an extended workbench of Western firms. The term “extended workbench” refers to firms specializing in producing standardized intermediate products that, compared to more sophisticated final products, feature a lower scope for product differentiation and lower price over marginal cost markups.====Utilizing official micro data on German manufacturing firms containing information on firms’ product prices and quantities at the ten-digit product level over 15 years, we test the extended workbench hypothesis. We apply a firm-level regression framework that compares firm productivity between East and West Germany while controlling for differences in firms’ product portfolios. We thereby compare firms producing products at the same position in the value chain. A core result is that East-West differences in firms’ revenue productivity are unaffected by controlling for product fixed effects. We thus find no support for the “extended workbench hypothesis” (or, generally, vertical specialization) in explaining the productivity gap.====The above result also implies that if price differences matter for productivity differences, they matter in the form of horizontal product differentiation within narrowly defined product classes. Hence, an alternative explanation for the sustained regional productivity gap is that Eastern firms produce goods at the same position in the value chain but, because they cannot command western prices (e.g. because of inferior branding), they produce cheaper varieties. Such product differentiation patterns are plausible as, after the fall of the iron curtain, East German firms entered the world market without established brand names==== and with a low perceived product quality (Collier and Siebert 1991). Thus, East German firms had either to specialize in cheaper products or to heavily invest into product quality, brand names, and reputation to catch up to their Western counterparts in terms of product appeal and output prices.====We show that even three decades after the fall of the iron curtain, firms producing in East Germany continue to specialize in cheaper product varieties. As cheaper products can be produced with fewer or cheaper inputs (e.g. less investments into brand names or research and development, handmade and customized production versus assembly line production), there exists a tradeoff in revenue productivity between producing ==== goods versus producing goods featuring higher consumer utility and prices (Atkin et al., 2019). As it is ==== unclear whether this tradeoff in revenue productivity favors producers of high or low utility products, we test whether the East German disadvantage in revenue productivity results from either this tradeoff working against low utility producers or from a genuine physical productivity disadvantage in the East.====We first document that, ====, Eastern firms produce ==== quantities for given inputs but earn lower revenues. However, when producing the same product for the same price segment, Eastern firms’ ==== is 5–8 percent below Western levels.==== This gap in physical productivity fully explains the gap in revenue productivity. An important implication is that simply switching to high-price products will barely help the East as the quantity-price tradeoff only marginally benefits high-price producers. Hence, specialization of Eastern firms in cheaper product varieties cannot explain the documented productivity gap. Instead, the East has a genuine price-adjusted physical productivity disadvantage compared to the West.====Finally, we study why East German firms survived in the long run despite lower productivity. We demonstrate that lower labor costs outweigh lower productivity such that Eastern and Western firms are equally competitive. This also provides a first step towards explaining why the observed price and productivity patterns are persistent: Given that their competitiveness is similar to Western high-price producers, Eastern firms have no incentives to deviate from their specialization in low-price products.====The remainder proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature, Section 3 presents the data and discusses descriptive evidence on output price differences between East and West Germany, Section 4 presents our empirical results and additional robustness and heterogeneity analyses.

These conditions, which are attached to IMF lending programs, cover a variety of issues from fiscal and monetary reform to economic liberalization and institutional change. In this paper we empirically examined the effects of IMF programs and conditionality requirements on structural transformation through changes in the technology-and-skill intensity and overall economic complexity of exports. Our empirical methodology accounted for policy and conditionality heterogeneity across country and time and accounts for the endogeneity of IMF programs and conditions. The empirical results suggest that IMF programs and conditionality requirements along a spectrum of policy areas had no robust or significant effect on export structure, economic complexity or export diversification. Overall, we found no evidence of any positive effects of IMF programs or IMF conditionality requirements on the technology-and-skill intensity of exports.","Since 1980s the conditionality-induced Structural Adjustment Programs (SAP) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have become a major part of the standard crisis-management and post-crisis economic reform toolkit. According to IMF, these reforms aim at restoring or maintaining “balance-of-payments viability and macroeconomic stability while setting the stage for sustained, high-quality growth” (IMF, 2019a). Particularly, promoting growth has been a major goal of IMF lending since the 1990s as IMF's mission evolved from a short-term liquidity provider to a long-term development agency (Boughton, 2012, p.196; Reinhart and Trebesch, 2016). In this paper we examine the effects of IMF program participation and policy conditions on structural transformation through changes in export sophistication.====The IMF policy reforms are distributed over years and are attached to IMF loans as pre-requisites. The IMF Executive Board supervises the adoption of these reforms and decides on the disbursement of IMF loans, pending a positive review by the IMF staff on their successful implementation, also called “demonstrable policy actions.” However, despite their wide-spread adoption, we still do not know whether these reforms actually work as the empirical evidence on their effectiveness remains quite limited. The IMF measures the success of its programs according to “the frequency of successor program engagements,” which is hardly a real measure of success (IMF, 2019b, p.9). Besides, more than a quarter of IMF members have had an IMF program 50% or more of the time since they became an IMF member (Reinhart and Trebesch, 2016). Moreover, in case of program failures, or repeated program engagements (which have increased overtime), the IMF puts most of the blame on errors in implementation and surveillance gaps rather than the programs themselves. Or, even when IMF's own research shows that programs failed or program objectives remained “often ambiguous,” they call for more reforms and tighter surveillance (Andritzky et al., 2021). In few cases when IMF admits that the impact of its adjustment programs “was less-growth friendly than anticipated” and that “the assumed payoffs from structural reforms [for productivity and growth] were overly optimistic” and in fact “some reforms weigh on growth in the short run”, it insists that they will be “paying off” later (IMF, 2019b, pp.19-20, 39).====Several studies tried addressing this deficit in evaluating IMF program effectiveness, though focusing on program participation rather than program conditions. Dreher and Vaubel (2004) fail to find any effect of IMF conditionality monetary growth, budget deficit, current account balance, international reserves, and government spending. Furthermore, Przeworski and Vreeland (2000), Barro and Lee (2005), Butkiewicz and Yanikkaya (2005) and Dreher (2006) report a negative relationship between IMF program participation and economic growth, while Easterly (2005) finds no significant relationship at all. Barro and Lee (2005) also detect no significant effect of increasing IMF programs on investment, inflation, government consumption, and openness. Moreover, Dreher and Walter (2010) finds that IMF programs increase the likelihood of a currency crisis. IMF programs are also shown to increase the within-country inequality (Forster et al., 2019). There is also evidence of increasing social conflicts, weakening democracy, and higher probability of military coups after IMF interventions (Przeworski and Vreeland, 2000; Barro and Lee, 2005; Abouharb and Cingranelli, 2007; Casper, 2017). Furthermore, IMF programs are shown to have an ideological bias in their design, aiming to dismantle developmentalist state capacity, limit public sector interventions and protect foreign creditors (Przeworski and Vreeland, 2000; Grabel, 2011; Boughton, 2012; Eichengreen and Woods, 2016; Kentikelenis et al., 2016; Babb and Kentikelenis, 2018).====No study, however, has examined the direct effects of IMF program participation and program conditions on structural determinants of long run development and growth. Particularly, we know little about how IMF reforms affect structural transformation through changes in the technology-and-skill intensity of exports, which could help explain the causes of reported negative or insignificant growth effects of IMF programs. The silence of IMF on the effects of its programs on the structural causes of long run growth, even after hosting a conference on ‘diversification and structural transformation====” in 2013, is especially surprising, and has been noted by the IMF's own review of program design and conditionality (IMF, 2019b, p.54, 62).====But why should we care about trade structure? Economic development is about structural change, whereby countries move away from primary products to more advanced manufacturing and higher value-added services. Furthermore, what you export matters for long run development, which is a dynamic process reinforced by reallocating resources towards manufacturing sectors that enjoy increasing returns. The pioneers of development economics heavily emphasized this transformation and its role in long run development and growth (Myrdal, 1957; Hirschman, 1958; Kaldor, 1966). Recent studies confirm these insights, showing that increasing product sophistication and economic complexity are the main drivers of structural change and long-run growth (Amsden, 1989; Lall, 2000, 2001; Imbs and Wacziarg, 2003; An and Iyigun, 2004; Lall et al., 2006; Hausmann et al., 2007; Hidalgo et al., 2007; Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009; Cadot et al., 2011; Rodrik, 2016 Bustos et al., 2012; Lederman and Maloney, 2012). Exports that are more technology-and-skill-intensive, for example, have stronger productivity and growth effects as they facilitate faster physical and human capital accumulation and technological advancement. Endogenous growth and spillover effects are also the highest in the production of higher-skill manufactures, allowing greater scope for dynamic gains. Thus, economic growth and the catching-up process goes hand in hand with export diversification and sophistication.====What role does IMF play in this structural change? The advocates of the IMF interventions point out various developmental and growth benefits of IMF reforms including structural, institutional, fiscal, monetary and external account reforms, and economic liberalization in trade, finance, and labor markets. Exchange rate reforms, for example, can help increase competitiveness of manufacturing industries, and move resources from nontradable goods, thereby increasing the skill content of exports. These reforms can also improve the entry and survival rates of exporters. Likewise, liberalizing international trade and investment can correct price distortions, increase efficiency and productivity through competition, and thus contribute to increasing export sophistication. Financial sector reforms can help financial sector development, credit market deepening, and increase credit to private sector, all of which can facilitate the development of more skill intensive and value-added industries with higher external finance needs (Levchenko, 2007; Sheng and Yang, 2016). Similarly, limiting public sector interventions through privatization of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), streamlining government bureaucracy, and reducing budget deficits can increase efficiency and competition while preventing crowding out, all of which can encourage development of higher value-added industries. Institutional reforms can improve the rule of law and bureaucratic quality, allowing the growth of higher value-added sectors and introduction of new products (Levchenko, 2007; Sheng and Yang, 2016).====The opposite of these expectations is also true. The supposed positive effects of trade liberalization, for example, are found to be elusive, if existent at all (Rodríguez and Rodrik, 2000; Rodrik, 2016). Likewise, the assumed growth enhancing effects of flexible exchange rates are widely disputed (Demir and Razmi, 2022). The same ambiguity goes for financial liberalization and its growth effects (Prasad et al., 2007; Dreher and Walter, 2010; Bumann et al., 2013). After decades of privatization, the debate over whether it stimulates efficiency, growth, investment or technology and skills upgrading is also not settled yet (Hodge, 2018). Through undermining the developmental state capacity, IMF reforms are also argued to hurt the development probabilities of low- and middle-income countries (Grabel, 2011; Eichengreen and Woods, 2016; Kentikelenis et al., 2016).====Surprisingly, most of IMF program predictions remain theoretically ambiguous ==== empirically untested. While IMF's own review of its programs referred to growth over 300 times in a single report, it hardly discussed the effects of programs on the ==== of growth except for admitting that it frequently overestimated program-induced “productivity gains and capital investment” (IMF, 2019b). In other instances, the focus has been on the balance of payments, public debt, or central bank reserves. This is surprising given the insights from development economics, structuralist macroeconomics and the ‘new’ new trade theory, which emphasize the importance of building comparative advantage in high value-added sectors as a condition for long run growth and development (Lall, 2000, 2001; Imbs and Wacziarg, 2003; Lall et al., 2006; Hausmann et al., 2007; Cadot et al., 2011Rodrik, 2016).====In this paper we make four contributions to the literature. First, we explore the effect of IMF program participation and conditionality on the technology-and-skill intensity of exports (i.e., export sophistication). Second, we examine the importance of country heterogeneity as revealed in the composition of exports as well as the content and coverage of IMF conditions. Third, we capture policy and conditionality heterogeneity along a spectrum of areas and across country and time. Fourth, in the estimation methodology, we account for the endogeneity of selection into IMF programs, and the endogeneity of IMF conditions in a country that is selected into an IMF program.====Our empirical analysis is based on data on IMF conditions and export structure in 175 countries between 1980-2014. In the estimation, we use a joint estimation method and employ instrumental variables to tackle the endogeneity of IMF program participation and IMF conditionality requirements. The empirical results suggest that IMF programs and conditionality requirements along a spectrum of policy areas has no robust or significant effect on trade structure, economic complexity or export diversification. Overall, we find no evidence of any positive effects on the upgrading of technology-and-skill intensity of exports. These results are robust to a rich battery of robustness tests.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next section presents a discussion of the evolution of IMF conditionality requirements.

We demonstrate the presence of this trade-off in the case of a protectionist FDI policy in Indonesia. Using a yearly census of Indonesian manufacturing firms from 2000 to 2015, we link product-level changes in binding FDI regulation due to major regulatory tightening to changes in firm-level productivity. Controlling for an extensive set of fixed effects as well as potential political economy drivers of regulation, we show that a tightening of the regulatory environment was successful in reducing foreign capital reliance among regulated firms, and led to increases in FDI among non-regulated firms producing the same product. Despite compensating increases in domestic capital, regulated firms experienced relative productivity losses. This points towards either a less efficient allocation of domestic capital or a general inferiority of domestic capital as compared to foreign investments.","In the course of the last two decades, developing and emerging economies liberalized their markets substantially, dismantling trade barriers and welcoming larger inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). This global process was accompanied by numerous regulatory shifts and reversals (Harding and Javorcik, 2011, Bourlès et al., 2013). The recent global trend of tightening investment regimes has been mostly motivated by concerns for national security and the need of protecting strategic national assets (UNCTAD, 2020). When FDI regulation is used to shield strategic domestic industries, this may not only change the firms’ access to foreign capital but also the overall competitive environment (Aitken and Harrison, 1999, Helpman et al., 2004). Our study adds to the general understanding of this phenomenon in the context of developing countries by investigating the effects of a protectionist policy reform on firm productivity in Indonesia that introduced substantial product- and firm-specific limitations on FDI.====While the positive link between foreign participation and firm productivity has been widely documented in the literature (Aitken and Harrison, 1999, Arnold and Javorcik, 2009, Javorcik and Poelhekke, 2017), the direct effects of FDI regulation on firm outcomes have been less extensively explored. Existing panel studies show a negative link between more aggregate measures of policy restrictiveness and sectoral (Bourlès et al., 2013) or firm productivity (Duggan et al., 2013). Analyzing the aftermath of China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Eppinger and Ma (2019) document positive effects of FDI de-regulation on Chinese firms’ productivity. This still leaves the empirical question open, whether the effects of a regulatory tightening are symmetric to those of de-regulation. Our empirical analysis addresses this research gap by analyzing the effect of a substantial increase in restrictions on foreign ownership in 2007 on the productivity of Indonesian manufacturing firms. Based on a rich firm panel that spans 16 years, our empirical strategy explores the aftermath of five-digit product-specific==== regulatory reforms at a high level of granularity.====Foreign capital is expected to affect firm productivity through several channels. It can substitute for domestic capital and relieve liquidity constraints if access to domestic capital is limited. Foreign investors have been shown to introduce non-tangible productive assets such as technological advancements, managerial abilities, marketing skills, trading contacts and improved reputation (Aitken and Harrison, 1999, Arnold and Javorcik, 2009, Javorcik and Poelhekke, 2017). As a result, firms with foreign participation are typically more productive, more capital intensive, and pay higher wages (Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare, 2010). At the same time, the mere threat of foreign competition has been shown to increase the productivity of domestic enterprises (Bao and Chen, 2018). Similarly, FDI is usually also found to spill over along the value chain to other firms in the economy (Javorcik, 2004, Gorodnichenko et al., 2014, Genthner, 2021). Since precise data on FDI regulation is frequently unavailable, most studies rely on FDI flows to proxy for reforms in FDI regulation. But as investment flows themselves are influenced by a large number of different factors, this raises the fundamental problem of unobserved heterogeneity (Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare, 2010). Alternatively, newer studies rely on aggregated indices of FDI openness (Topalova and Khandelwal, 2011, Duggan et al., 2013), which by construction cannot be used to capture differential effects of regulation across more disaggregated sectors. The use of disaggregated regulation data should help us to trace the effects of FDI regulation at a finer grained product scale.====Indonesia offers a great case to not only study the effects of FDI on firms (e.g., Blalock and Gertler, 2008), but also to investigate the productivity effects of FDI regulation itself. As one of the largest economies in the world, with a wide variety of industries that rely on an abundance of both human and natural resources, Indonesia has emerged as an attractive FDI recipient. In order to increase transparency of the regulatory environment, the Indonesian government introduced a negative investment list (NIL) in 2000, which listed all sectors to be closed or only conditionally open to FDI (WTO, 2013, Lindblad, 2015). The FDI regime tightened regulations in 2007 with a substantial extension of the sectoral coverage of the NIL, followed by minor adjustments in 2010 and a partial deregulation in 2014.====The effects of this policy instrument have been hitherto unexplored, and offer a particularly interesting opportunity to investigate the effects of FDI regulation on firm performance at a highly disaggregated level. This paper exploits policy variation due to three revisions to this regulatory instrument that contains a list of five-digit products that will be either fully or partially closed to FDI in the future, also specifying whether all firms or only certain types of firms are to be affected. We link regulatory changes in the NIL to a 16 year firm-level panel dataset, from 2000 to 2015, derived from the Indonesian yearly census of manufacturing plants. This census includes the full universe of manufacturing firms with at least 20 employees and reports a wide range of firm-level outcomes.==== Our main outcome variables are the share of foreign ownership of each firm and three measures of firm productivity: estimated total factor productivity (TFP) as well as value added per worker and value added per capital. Our empirical strategy contrasts firms exposed to binding firm-specific regulation to firms that produce the same regulated product but have not been directly subject to FDI restrictions and are only affected due to regulatory spillovers within the same product market (Bourlès et al., 2013). The distinction between binding regulation and regulated products is possible because regulatory conditions of the NIL are firm-specific and vary by year, linking information from the NIL to the firm’s main product (at five-digit level) while also utilizing individual firm characteristics (firm size, legal status, and prior foreign investment) to identify direct exposure to regulation. To get a better understanding of what drives our main results, we focus on changes in capital composition within affected firms and product markets and contrast the effects of the initial regulatory tightening to those of later de-regulation. We also consider several forms of heterogeneity, comparing especially effects between firms differing in their dependence on external finance (Rajan and Zingales, 1998) and advanced technologies.====All our results are conditional on firm fixed effects, and hence only consider within-firm variation in the main economic outcomes over time. Additionally, our specifications include island-year and two-digit sector-year effects, which capture all common time variation due to global and national sector-specific shocks, as well as variation in average input prices or broad regional economic conditions. The panel structure of 16 yearly waves allows us to investigate the time profile of regulation in a more flexible way, by also including lags and leads of regulatory change.====The identification of causal linkages between FDI regulation and firm-level changes in foreign capital shares and productivity requires two main conditions to be fulfilled: no further interventions should be spuriously correlated with the FDI regulation, and regulation should be exogenous to all factors driving changes in firm productivity. The inclusion of two-digit sector-year effects deals with average effects of broad regulatory trends, at least to some extent. Additionally, we control for changes in output and input tariffs, as well as a combined proxy for other non-tariff measures, to make sure that our results are not driven by adjustments of tariff rates or fine-grained non-tariff trade regulations. As most of Indonesia’s trade liberalization reforms were already completed by the mid-2000s (Kis-Katos and Sparrow, 2015), we do not expect major effects from tariff changes.====The second requirement poses a larger challenge, especially since the government may have faced incentives to restrict foreign entry, particularly among the least productive industries. Such a lobbying process (in the spirit of Grossman and Helpman, 1994) would likely yield a negative correlation between regulation and productivity. Indeed, by testing a wide range of product market characteristics, we demonstrate that several political economy factors serve as good predictors of changes in regulation at the product level. Product markets were more likely to be regulated by the NIL if a larger share of the firms producing those products were either recently privatized or remained state-owned, or if existing state-owned producers were less productive, on average. Moreover, the NIL generally regulated products which were produced in larger firms, within more concentrated industries, and in firms that experienced larger capital accumulation before becoming regulated.====We address such reasons for endogenous product-specific regulation by including interactions of initial product characteristics with a full set of year effects as well as a large set of time-variant product-level traits. Finally, since the NIL does not equally affect all firms within the same five-digit product market (regulation of some products is conditional on firm size, legal status, or foreign ownership share), we also have to make sure that the coefficients on binding regulation do not simply reflect different trajectories of firm growth across selected traits. Therefore, in our preferred specifications, we also allow for differential initial firm-trait-specific trends. Conditional on our controls, we see no evidence of pre-reform trends in productivity differences across regulated and non-regulated firms, which supports a causal interpretation of our findings.====The results document a robust negative relationship between binding regulation and foreign capital shares as well as firm productivity. Foreign capital already declined in regulated firms one year before the regulation came into effect, reflecting the presence of anticipation effects. Declines in productivity in regulated firms followed with a lag and were much stronger for capital productivity as compared to labor productivity. Notably, relative as well as absolute declines in foreign capital within regulated firms were fully compensated by increases in domestic capital, suggesting either a less efficient allocation or a lower technological content of domestic capital. At the same time, regulation shifted highly productive foreign capital from directly regulated firms to other parts of the economy. Consistent with this explanation, we find weak evidence that firms that produce regulated products but that were exempt from regulation themselves (e.g., because of their size) experienced a relative productivity boost.====Our study is among the first to exploit fine grained variation in the regulatory framework of FDI in an emerging economy. While previous studies mainly focused on FDI liberalization (Girma et al., 2015, Eppinger and Ma, 2019), we identify direct firm exposure to a tightening of FDI regulation and link it to declines in firm productivity. We further show that subsequent de-regulation does not trigger an immediate productivity response by undoing earlier productivity losses. This highlights the importance of rolling out FDI policies over the long term and provides evidence of longer-lasting effects of regulatory tightening. Despite the highly specific context of Indonesia, our results have important implications for other developing countries where similar policies are in place as well. For instance, the Philippines have a similar negative list since 1991 which was latest revised in 2021 (UNCTAD, 2021).====The paper is structured as follows.

Using newly digitized data on Chinese power plants from 1912 to 1935, we examine the impact of a trade shock, which protected the domestic manufacturing sector from import competition, on the adoption of electricity. To establish a causal relationship, we exploit time variations in imported ==== caused by China's unexpected recovery of tariff autonomy in 1929 and cross-sectional variations in local access to treaty ports. We find that the reduction in manufactured imports resulted from the tariff shock led to the expansion of the local electricity sector. Further analysis suggests that the booming domestic industrial sector rather than population agglomeration was the key channel for the effect.","Technological diffusion is critical for a new technology to produce widespread social and economic impact (Hall, 2004). In reality, diffusion often takes time regardless of the potential benefits—even the general-purpose technologies (GPTs), which generate persistent growth in whole eras, encountered delay in their adoption due to constraints either in the supply or the demand side (Bresnahan, 2010).====This paper studies the impact of demand factors on the adoption of electricity, one of the GPTs that dramatically enhance productivity and improve human welfare (Kline and Moretti, 2014; Gordon, 2016). Despite the benefits, the initial adoption of electricity can be slow and expensive due to large initial investment in machinery purchase and electric grid construction. In this case, factors that increase demand, such as a booming industrial sector, may facilitate the adoption process (Murphy et al., 1989; Ryan, 2018). Yet, as the growth of the electricity and the industrial sectors usually happens simultaneously, it is difficult to empirically identify the impact of one on the other.====To address this issue, we focus on early twentieth-century China, when both the industrial and the electricity sectors were in their infancy, and collect new first-hand information to capture regional differences in the expansion of the electricity sector. Within this period, the capacity of private power plants increased from 300 kW to 260 million kW, corresponding to an increase in electricity coverage from a negligible amount to 7.8% of the population. The rapid expansion of the electricity sector coincides with China's success in increasing its tariff rates and the resulting boom in the manufacturing sector. The limited public investment in electrification programs implies that the entry of power plants is largely demand-driven, as most of them were privately owned. Therefore, when a trade policy reduces the import of manufactured products, it is likely to promote the expansion of the electricity sector by increasing domestic industrial growth and generating positive demand shock for electricity.====We start the empirical analysis with a difference-in-differences (DID) style regression, combining time variations from the port-level import values of major manufactured commodities from 1912 to 1935 and the cross-sectional variations in each county's effective distance to its nearest treaty port to measure county-level access to international trade. Because the actual port-level import values might have responded to domestic industrial growth, we construct import shocks by multiplying the national import values of major manufactured commodities and the initial trade share of each port for these commodities. To take the heterogeneous demand for electricity of different industries into account, we follow Autor et al. (2019) to augment the import shocks using the corresponding industry-level electricity intensity of the commodities to obtain the final measurement for import exposure. The baseline regression shows that a one standard deviation reduction in a county's import exposure increases the total capacity of power plants in the county by 6.46% in the following year.====As import values of different commodities can respond to local economic conditions, we use plausibly exogeneous tariff changes resulting from the recovery of China's tariff autonomy in 1929 to construct an instrument. Before 1929, China's tariff rates were restrained by the treaties that set a flat rate of 5% on most commodities. After a series of negotiations with its main trading partners since 1921, especially after the unexpected recognition of China's tariff autonomy by the U.S. due to political reasons, the Chinese government successfully regained the right to set its own tariff rates and imposed a new tariff in 1929. The resulting tariff rates on primary imports, mainly manufactured products, increased from a flat 5% to a range of 15% to over 50%. As local power plants provided non-tradable goods, this tariff shock is plausibly exogenous to the entry decisions of power plants. The results of our instrumental variables (IV) estimation are similar to those obtained from the baseline regression, suggesting that a one standard deviation decrease in import exposure induces a 3.57% increase in the total capacity of power plants. Our results become more pronounced when considering counties closer to the treaty ports and are robust to alternative definitions of trade access and electricity intensity.====To further alleviate the concern that our results only capture the simultaneous trends of the trade and the electricity sectors, we conduct a placebo test and find that future import reduction cannot predict increases in the capacity of power plants. This is consistent with the hypothesis that power plants respond to increases in demand due to trade shocks.====We next examine two potential mechanisms through which decreases in the import of manufactured products might promote the entry of power plants. Higher tariff levels on manufactured goods may facilitate the growth of industries that rely heavily on electricity. Further, a boom in local industries can lead to population agglomeration in local urban areas. Both effects can increase the demand for electricity. We collect county-level information on industrial output values in 1933 and find that the spatial distribution of these values is strongly correlated with that of power plants. In addition, the impact of trade on electricity expansion decreases after incorporating the industrial output values in the main specification. In contrast, when we analyze populations using newly digitized data in 1912, 1920, 1928 and 1933, we find that neither population agglomeration nor the population growth rate can explain the original effects of trade on power plants. Our explorations of possible mechanisms suggest that trade-induced industrial growth, instead of population agglomeration, is responsible for the entry of power plants.====This paper contributes to studies about technological adoption, specifically electrification, in the early stages of a country's economic development. Recent studies on the consequences of electrification show that electricity is essential for economic development (Dinkelman, 2011; Rud, 2012; Lipscomb et al., 2013; Kline and Moretti, 2014; Kitchens, 2014; Kitchens and Fishback, 2015; Fiszbein et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Lewis and Severnini, 2020; Kassem, 2021). However, the manner in which electrification is initiated in a country receives much less attention, although the shortage of electricity in the developing world is a well-recognized and severe problem (Fisher-Vanden et al., 2015; Allcott et al., 2016; Burgess et al., 2020). We contribute to this literature by examining how a developing country without a capable government or sufficient fiscal funding could facilitate the electrification process. Our findings show that private providers can be incentivized to enter the market in response to a growing demand from the manufacturing sector.====This paper also complements the extensive studies on the effects of trade policies on domestic industrial growth. Despite the general trend of globalization, the last decade has witnessed a considerable revival in trade policies, and it is important to empirically evaluate their effects on the economy (Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2016). This study particularly relates to others that study trade policies in historical settings, providing useful perspectives from which to understand contemporary challenges to globalization (O'Rourke, 2019). Recent studies that use historical settings include Juhász (2018), who shows that a trade blockade that reduced the French market's access to British imports increased the adoption of mechanized cotton spinning in France. Similarly, Liu (2020) examines how the sudden interruption of Eurasian trade by the First World War facilitated the entry of textile firms into early twentieth-century China. Unlike previous studies on the effects of trade shocks on tradable sectors, we find that trade policies increase the demand for domestic production capacity, thereby unintentionally promoting the growth of non-tradable sectors. Moreover, by studying an early modern economy whose trade policies were similar to those adopted by colonial economies, our conclusion echoes those of Bonfatti and Brey (2020), showing colonial trade might have prevented industrial growth and hurt the welfare of peripheral countries.","Trade shocks, industrial growth, and electrification in early 20th-century China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000166,2 March 2022,2022,Research Article,62.0

However, the effectiveness of these measures on mobility has been markedly different. Employing a difference-in-differences design, we analyse the effectiveness of movement restrictions across different countries. We disentangle the role of regulation (stringency measures) from the role of people's knowledge about the spread of COVID-19. We proxy COVID-19 knowledge by using Google Trends data on the term “Covid”. We find that lockdown measures have a higher impact on mobility the more people learn about COVID-19. This finding is driven by countries with low levels of trust in institutions and low levels of education.","According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (February, 2022), more than 396 million of COVID-19 infected cases have been reported, with more than 5.7 million deaths.==== The pandemic has had a devastating impact on population health and well-being, and on the economy of countries across the globe (====).====The World Health Organization announced the international outbreak of the COVID-19 infection on January 30, 2020, and declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (====). Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached nearly all countries around the world. However, the pandemic had largely heterogeneous effects, since countries have differed in their exposure to the virus, in the public and private response to it, and in the overall level of preparedness.====National governments have been implementing measures which restrict the movement of individuals (referred to, colloquially, as ‘lockdown’, a term we will also adopt throughout the paper) and impose social distancing on them. Interestingly, these measures display significant variation in their intensity, with some countries adopting stringency measures very early in the pandemic cycle, whereas others taking a less restrictive approach (====).====Of course, the purpose of these measures that restrict mobility and impose social distancing is to strongly reduce the spread of the virus, in order to contain the number of severe cases and deaths. From this point of view, policy makers and experts typically aim at avoiding an excessive pressure on hospitals and intensive care units, which would lead to a dramatic increase in the mortality of the disease. However, the accomplishment of this purpose not only depends on the design and timeliness of those coercive measures, but also on how citizens react to those measures, strengthening or weakening them with their individual course of action.====Interestingly, the lockdown measures have also been the subject of some controversy amongst political, legal scholars, and the public.==== Several demonstrations against lockdown have taken place in many countries in Europe====, in the US====, and elsewhere. It is unclear whether those protests are driven by impatience, a genuine knowledge that the lockdown measures are disproportionate to the pandemic threat, or simply an instance of aversion against an authoritarian turn in the actions of democratic and non-democratic governments alike.====Individual level reactions might be more compliant with government restrictions the more citizens are worried about the risks of contagion and of severe health outcomes. In turn, those perceived risks are affected by the information that citizens have about the pandemic, which they obtain by personal contacts and by being exposed to the mass media, both traditional and internet-based ones (namely, websites, and social networks). Recent literature has widely covered this topic across different domains. ==== find an effect of news media on crime perceptions: they use a difference-in-differences approach that compares individual perceptions of those with a wide range of available TV channels to those with limited choice.

In particular, we use daily observations from February 15, 2020, to December 25, 2020 (315 days), across 35 countries for which these data are available.====We exploit the staggered implementation of stringency measures adopted by countries over time, while controlling for country and daily fixed effects.

This research provides a comparative analysis of retirement timing in Germany and Great Britain. In Germany, workers in more routine jobs had between one and two percentage points higher probability leaving the labor market faster when compared to workers in less routine occupations. The relationship is robust and relatively constant over time. In Great Britain, by contrast, workers from routine and non-routine jobs appear to leave the labor market with a similar timing. I contend that institutional characteristics can explain the differences across countries.","Longevity and the growing population share of the fairly numerous post-war birth cohorts speak to the paramount importance of increasing the length of professional activity, especially in Europe, as evidenced by OECD reports and European Commission policy papers (OECD, 2006, Comission of the European Communities (EC), 2009, respectively). Longer professional activity in the labor market occurs at the time of the most profound technological revolution since the Industrial Revolution (Autor et al., 2003, Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). This massive change in the nature of jobs created both opportunities and challenges. The opportunities are related to the fact that equipped with better machines, many jobs necessitate lower physical strain, thus becoming better suited to keep older workers able to perform the tasks (Filer and Petri, 1988, Lund and Villadsen, 2005, Dal Bianco et al., 2015). Moreover, jobs involving tasks complementary to new technological developments became better paid, providing incentives for postponing retirement. The challenges arise from the labor replacing nature of automation. Once machines become less expensive than human labor, the demand for many tasks falls and workers become at risk of dismissal. Given notoriously low job-finding rates for older workers,==== some of them might permanent leave the labor market. The complementarity between a job and new technologies is given by the extent of non-routine tasks in an occupation, whereas substitution relates to the share of routine tasks (Autor et al., 2003, Goos and Manning, 2007, Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). These two forces work in opposite directions, and the net effect for older workers remains an empirical question.====In addition to being empirically ambivalent, the link between automation and early retirement is far from a one-direction relationship on theoretical grounds. Indeed, typically workers in routine-intensive occupations are modeled to have worse employment prospects (see Jaimovich and Siu, 2020, Carrillo-Tudela and Visschers, 2013). However, these assumptions reflect two highly stylized facts: (i) that technological progress increases productivity in all jobs except for routine occupations; (ii) that jobs in nominally identical occupations have a stable task content. Such assumptions stand against insights from the structural change literature. This literature suggests that productivity growth could be match specific; hence only new matches benefit from automation (e.g. Caballero and Hammour, 1996). This approach implies that non-routine jobs might disappear faster when a positive productivity shock affects the sector. The monolithic view of occupations also stands at odds with Freeman et al. (2020). They show that changes in the task content of the economy were largely driven by changes within occupations, as opposed to changes in the employment structure.====In this paper, I test whether ====. I study this question in two different institutional contexts: Germany and the United Kingdom. In comparative terms, Germany provides relatively generous early retirement schemes and unemployment benefits. The availability of such schemes allows workers to retire before the official retirement age without a substantial cut in their pension benefits (Börsch-Supan and Schnabel, 1998, Dietz and Walwei, 2011, Inderbitzin et al., 2016). Moreover, employment protection is high, and workers’ representation in firm-level decisions is recognized. In the UK, unemployment benefits offer a substantially lower replacement rate, and the only way to bridge finance early labor market exit and pensions benefit eligibility age consists of biting into private voluntary savings and private pension plans (Blundell and Johnson, 1998, Blundell et al., 2002). This low social safety net level is coupled with low employment protection and less workers’ agency in comparative terms.====My analysis builds on the task content of jobs literature (see Autor et al., 2003, Goos and Manning, 2007, Acemoglu and Autor, 2011, Jaimovich and Siu, 2020). I use panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to compare older workers’ exit decisions in these two countries. I follow the literature and deploy O*NET classification to measure routine-intensity of jobs. Having individual panel data, I can study the retirement timing decisions conditional on task content of the previous employment procedures. Given that workers could switch to routine occupations as a part of a progression towards retirement, I employ a five-year lag to measure the relation between permanent labor market exits and the task content of jobs. The main specification also controls for other occupation characteristics related to automation and retirement decisions.====I find a strong relationship in Germany: routine intensiveness of a job is related to a higher probability of retirement over the subsequent five years. The relation holds for workers at ages as low as 50 years old, suggesting that task content can help explain early retirement patterns. The relation is statistically significant and economically large: workers in routine jobs are between 5% and 10% more likely to exit the labor market within the next five years when compared to workers in jobs with low routine intensity.==== In the case of the UK, I find no significant effects: the precision of estimates is similar to SOEP data, but the estimated effects are substantially lower. These differences can be linked to the institutional settings in the two countries.====The preferred interpretation of this link between task content of jobs and labor market exits is based on changes in labor demand and frictions to mobility. Both links have been thoroughly explored in the literature. The fall in demand for occupations with more routine content has been observed throughout the developed world (see Autor et al., 2003, Goos and Manning, 2007 among others). The frictions associated with occupational switching closer to retirement have also been widely acknowledge. As formalized by Carrillo-Tudela and Visschers (2013), more tenured workers have acquired more occupation-specific human capital. In consequence, they become less likely to transition to occupations requiring a different set of skills. If these workers become unemployed, they could spend more time unemployed until an opportunity arises. Among older workers, this might translate into earlier labor market exits. The difficulties of older workers in finding new employment positions are well-documented in the empirical literature. Baert et al. (2016) conduct a correspondence study in Belgium and find that 50 years-old workers were less likely to be called back for interviews than 6 or 12 years younger workers. The effect was larger when the new job differed from the previous. Neumark et al. (2016) finds a similar result, though the authors suggest a much smaller effect once the characteristics of the correspondence study are considered. Beyond correspondence studies, Marmora and Ritter (2015) find that dismissed workers are more likely to retire following an unemployment spell (see also Dietz and Walwei, 2011). These findings suggest that workers over 50 in routine jobs might be at a disadvantage compared to non-routine workers, not only because the falling demand for tasks makes unemployment more likely  (see Jaimovich and Siu, 2020) but also because of the difficulties in obtaining a job with a different task content.====Not only do workers lack an incentive for re-skilling. Employers might also tend to favor younger workers in training decisions. Workers close to retirement age offer lower returns on investment, given the shorter work horizon of these workers. Moreover, if employers perceive older workers to be less able to learn new skills, as shown by Van Dalen et al. (2010), they might overestimate the costs of training older workers. Both arguments have received empirical confirmation. Taylor and Urwin (2001) and Lindsay et al. (2013) demonstrate that older workers are less likely to participate in training, whereas Taylor and Urwin (2001) and Lazazzara et al. (2013) provide evidence that older workers are less likely to be offered training opportunities. In principle, this channel could affect workers in either occupation. It could hamper the mobility of workers in routine occupations, and it might reduce training opportunities for workers in non-routine jobs who want to update their skills.====My study is not the first to explore the link between workers’ age and the content of jobs. Autor and Dorn (2009) show that older workforce and routine-intensity coincide across occupations. Their research, as well as Cortes et al. (2017), highlights how (the lack of) inflows into routine jobs is a driving factor behind changes in the employment structure. These findings are complementary to those presented in this article. In principle, the lack of entry can coexist with more flows out of employment, and as long as the fall in inflows outpaces the increase in exits, these occupations might still observe an increase in average age. In other words, the trends observed by previous literature are compatible with both higher and lower retirement probabilities among workers in routine occupations. By focusing on workers close to retirement age, this research provides a new look at the link between task content of jobs and permanent labor market exits.====Finally, this study complements and extends prior work by Friedberg (2003), who finds that workers who lack computer skills have a harder time finding new employment opportunities and retire younger. While Friedberg (2003) studies specific skills of workers, I focus on the task content of jobs. As shown by the routine-based technological change literature, the distinction between skills and tasks is relevant: many high-skill jobs, such as bookkeeping, were as exposed to automation as assembly-line workers (Autor et al., 2003).====This paper is structured as follows. The following section provides an overview of the databases used in the study: O*NET for the task content of jobs and the longitudinal databases for workers’ retirement decisions. Then, in Section 2.1 I provide some stylized facts on the relation between retirement, task content of jobs, and workers’ age. Section 3 presents the main specification and introduces several tests that attest to the robustness of the relation between task content and retirement decisions. Section 4 discusses potential pitfalls of the preferred interpretation, expands on the relationship between the estimated coefficients and the institutional setting, and provides conclusions.",Phasing out: Routine tasks and retirement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759672200004X,17 February 2022,2022,Research Article,64.0

The increase is more substantial when controlling shareholders own more shares, and diversion for private benefits is less complementary to tax noncompliance. Liquidity has no significant impact on tax evasion—the most aggressive and risky tax noncompliance—and at the higher ends of the tax noncompliance distribution. The positive and significant effects are observed only at lower levels of tax noncompliance. We attribute the weaker impact of liquidity on aggressive tax noncompliance to diversion being more complementary to higher-risk tax noncompliance.","A significant portion of government tax revenue comes from corporate income tax payments, which can be reduced through successful tax noncompliance—a term we use to capture tax avoidance and evasion. Tax noncompliance is a common phenomenon worldwide, especially in emerging economies such as China. The National Audit Office of the People's Republic of China uncovered RMB11.89 billion (roughly 1.6 billion dollars) in tax noncompliance in 2003, based on a nationwide investigation of 788 randomly selected companies in 17 provinces and cities (Asian Wall Street Journal, A2, September 20, 2004).====China has been enjoying rapid economic development over the past several decades. Its policymakers have undertaken several stock market reforms to help facilitate rapid economic growth. One of the most crucial stock market reforms was the Split-Share Structure Reform (the Reform hereafter) in 2005, which mandated the conversion of nontradable shares (NTS) to tradable shares (TS). Before the Reform, roughly two-thirds of all outstanding A-shares were nontradable.==== So when NTS became TS following the Reform, the number of publicly tradable shares tripled, drastically increasing the liquidity of listed shares.====Prior studies suggest stock liquidity can increase tax noncompliance by improving the stock price informativeness. Liquidity makes the stock price more informative, making firm value more responsive to after-tax earnings and thereby enhancing the incentive for managers with equity-based compensation to take actions to increase after-tax profits (Holmstrom and Tirole, 1993; Faure-Grimaud and Gromb, 2004). Higher liquidity also puts stronger downward pressure on underperforming firms’ stock prices by enabling investors more easily sell shares and thereby increasing the ex-ante incentive to improve shareholder value (Admati and Pfleiderer, 2009; Edmans et al., 2013; Bharath et al., 2013). One way to improve after-tax profits and shareholder value is to lower taxes on pre-tax earnings through successful tax noncompliance. These positive effects on tax noncompliance will be more significant when the controlling shareholder's equity ownership is higher.====However, other studies suggest the opposite effect: Higher liquidity can lower tax noncompliance by reducing diversion of corporate profits for private benefits. Liquidity reduces diversion by intensifying external monitoring from the market for corporate control. Liquidity facilitates the formation of block holders by allowing investors to acquire stocks with less price impact (Kyle and Vila, 1991; Kahn and Winton, 1998). It also encourages block holder intervention and shareholder activism by helping them purchase shares secretly to capture more of the gains from the intervention (Maug, 1998; Kahn and Winton, 1998; Norli et al., 2015).====Lower diversion, in turn, may lead to lower tax noncompliance. Desai and Dharmapala (2006) and Desai et al. (2007) argue, with supporting evidence, that diversion complements tax noncompliance. Their rationale is that “Most transactions aimed at diverting corporate value toward controlling shareholders also reduce corporate tax liabilities. Similarly, many procedures aimed at enforcing a corporate tax liability make it more difficult for controlling shareholders to divert corporate value to their own advantage” (Desai et al., 2007, p. 592). If diversion and tax noncompliance are complementary, stronger external monitoring—enabled by higher liquidity—will reduce tax noncompliance by raising diversion costs, offsetting the positive impact through the price informativeness channel. Therefore, the overall effect of liquidity on tax noncompliance will depend on which of the two opposite channels is dominant, raising a question: How did the higher liquidity following the Reform affect corporate tax noncompliance?====To help answer this question, we offer a simple agency-theoretic model and test the model's predictions using the Reform as an exogenous regulatory shock on the liquidity of shares listed in China. Controlling shareholders held most NTS before the Reform (71% at the end of 2004). Before the Reform, they suffered the very incentive problem pointed out by Faure-Grimaud and Gromb (2004): When the controlling shareholders cannot sell shares, their ability to benefit from value-enhancing actions is limited. By allowing them to sell previously nontradable shares, the Reform improved their incentive to take measures to increase shareholder value and minimize corporate income tax payment.==== The Reform also strengthened external monitoring from the market for corporate control and made diversion more costly for controlling shareholders.====Our empirical strategy is a difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The first difference is changes in tax noncompliance from pre- to post-Reform periods. The second difference is the cross-sectional variation in the Reform effect on stock liquidity, as measured by the fraction of NTS before the Reform.==== The sample includes all non-financial A-share firms traded on the Shanghai or Shenzhen Stock Exchange at any point from 2002 (three years before the Reform) through 2008 (three years after the Reform).====We employ four different measures of tax noncompliance used in the literature: the effective tax rate, the book-tax difference, and each adjusted for firm size and industry differences. The estimation results show that the increase in stock liquidity brought on by the Reform significantly increased the overall tax noncompliance regardless of which measure of tax noncompliance we use.====The baseline results are robust to (1) the 2SLS estimation with an instrumental variable to address a potential endogeneity issue in the treatment variable, (2) testing the assumption of parallel time trends, (3) permutation tests of whether some random factors drive the results, (4) accounting for possible earnings management, (5) using the percentage of NTS held by the controlling shareholder before the Reform as an alternative treatment variable, (6) accounting for loss carryovers, (7) possible confounding effects arising from the allowance of equity incentive plans beginning in 2006, the new accounting standards introduced in 2007, and the tax law changes in 2008, (8) reestimating with different sets of control variables, and (9) using alternative definitions of the effective tax rate and the book-tax difference.====According to our model, the overall increase in tax noncompliance indicates that the positive effect through the stock price informativeness channel dominates the negative impact through the diversion channel. Consistent with the hypothesized impact of the stock price informativeness, the Reform made the stock price significantly more responsive to after-tax profits. Also, tax noncompliance increases more when controlling shareholders have higher share ownership.====However, the increase in overall tax noncompliance does not imply that the diversion channel is non-existent. According to Desai and Dharmapala (2006) and Desai et al. (2007), how diversion affects tax noncompliance depends on the degree of their complementarity: the more complementary the relation, a reduction in diversion leads to a more significant decline in tax noncompliance. Diversion often requires unethical and illegal transactions that complement aggressive tax noncompliance. Thus, the complementarity is likely more substantial when firms engage in more aggressive tax noncompliance, i.e., the upper end of the tax noncompliance distribution. We use two proxies for diversion to test this conjecture: the number of parties involved in related party transactions and loans to controlling shareholders. Both variables are positively related to tax noncompliance, and more so at higher levels of tax noncompliance.====The more intense external monitoring—enabled by higher liquidity—should reduce diversion, lowering tax noncompliance. But the effect will not be uniform throughout the tax noncompliance distribution. The impact will be more negative when the complementary is more potent at higher tax noncompliance. Therefore, the overall tax noncompliance should be more positive at the lower end of the distribution and significantly lower when firms pursue more aggressive, risky tax noncompliance.====We use the quantile regression approach to test this prediction. The results show the most positive and significant impact at the lowest tax noncompliance. The positive effect decreases monotonically and becomes insignificant as tax noncompliance increases. The most aggressive and riskiest form of tax noncompliance is tax evasion, which, if detected, is observed as tax fraud. Since we observe only detected tax frauds, we estimate the bivariate probit model as in Wang et al. (2010) and Khanna et al. (2015) to mitigate the partial observation problem. We find the Reform had no significant impact on the incidence of tax fraud.====In sum, the positive effect of higher liquidity through the stock price informativeness channel, on average, dominates its negative impact through the diversion channel. However, when firms engage in a diversion that complements aggressive, risky tax noncompliance, the complementary effect negates potential increases in tax noncompliance.====Finally, we examine whether and how the Reform's impact on tax noncompliance varies across two firm characteristics: financial constraints and state ownership. Prior studies suggest that financially constrained firms have more urgent needs to conserve cash and engage in tax noncompliance (Cai and Liu, 2009; Richardson et al., 2015; Edwards et al., 2016). Unsurprisingly, the Reform increased tax noncompliance significantly more among financially constrained firms. We also compare state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to non-SOEs and observe no noticeably different impacts on tax noncompliance.====This paper provides new insights into corporate tax noncompliance by connecting two seemingly unrelated literature: stock liquidity and tax noncompliance. The literature on liquidity shows that stock liquidity enhances managerial incentives and monitoring. But prior studies on how managerial incentives and monitoring are related to tax noncompliance show mixed—and sometimes contradictory—results.==== Our contribution to the literature is two-fold: providing a comprehensive theoretical framework that enables disentangling the effects of managerial incentives and monitoring on tax noncompliance and documenting novel evidence on the different channels through which liquidity affects tax noncompliance.====The following section provides a simple model. Section 3 outlines our empirical strategy and describes sample construction. Section 4 presents results on the overall tax noncompliance and evidence on the channels suggested by the model. Sections 5 and 6 investigate heterogeneous effects across the tax noncompliance distribution and firm characteristics. Section 7 conducts robustness tests.

From the eyes of the central controllers, the rational selection rule is to mix competence and loyalty when officials are selected to fill lower-tier positions and to select from them the more loyal to fill higher-level positions. Measuring competence by an official's contribution to local economic growth and loyalty by his work experience (connection) with central leaders, our empirical analysis finds that ability strongly matters and connection weakly matters for city officials promoted to provincial positions, but only connection matters for provincial officials promoted to central positions. Moreover, ability matters more in the early years, and connection matters more in the later years.","Political selection in China has become an active research subject in recent years. This paper studies the competence-loyalty tradeoff in China's political selection and its evolution since the early 1990s. China is becoming an increasingly more important player in the world, and its governing model is also changing rapidly. Studying China's unique model of political selection and the model's evolution will not only enrich the literature on non-democracies but also help the world form a better understanding of the country.====The existing literature on China's political selection revolves around the roles of economic performance and personal connection in determining officials’ promotion and mixed results have been found. Li and Zhou (2005) find that performance matters for the promotion of provincial officials, and Yao and Zhang (2015) find similar results for senior city officials. However, Shih et al. (2012) study members of the central committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and find that personal connection is the key determinant of membership. Yet, Fisman et al. (2020) obtain the opposite result for members of the politburo—sharing a hometown or being college alumni with an incumbent member hurts a candidate's chances in becoming a new member. In between, Landry et al. (2018) find that performance is a significant contributor for promotion at the county level but not at the city or provincial level; Jia et al. (2015) find that performance and connection complement each other for provincial officials’ promotion. Wiebe (2020a) replicate several published papers and find that some of their results are not robust. In his own study of prefectural mayors in 1998–2017 Wiebe (2020b), he does not find evidence to support merit-based promotion.====The above mixed results may reflect the competence-loyalty tradeoff inherent in the Chinese system. A classical dilemma faced by autocrats is that they must select competent subordinates to carry out orders but more competent subordinates are more likely to threaten their ruling position. Egorov and Sonin (2011) theoretically show that this dilemma leads the autocrat to select mediocre lieutenants. They also provide historical evidence to validate their argument. However, in a system of hierarchy, things may become more complex. Because officials working close to him pose a much larger threat Svolik (2009), the autocrat naturally selects more loyal agents to fill the inner circle. But, for lower-tier offices, the autocrat may be willing to select competent officials because he needs them to carry out economic production and their threats are much smaller due to their political remoteness. Therefore, results may vary when officials at different levels are studied.====The mixed results in the literature may also be linked to the evolution of China's political selection over time. During the past 30 years, there have been several changes of leadership in China. The CCP's mandate has also changed substantially to reflect the leaders’ personal preferences as well as to adapt to new domestic and international conditions. Therefore, different results may be obtained when different periods are studied; a more careful and time-sensitive study is needed.====This paper improves the literature in three dimensions: (a) we analyze the tradeoff between competence and loyalty from the eyes of the central controller; (b) we study both city and provincial officials; and (c) our data cover the period 1994–2017, the longest in the literature. So far, our study is the most comprehensive and has the potential to provide more robust results than those currently found in the literature.====To frame our empirical analysis, we build a theoretical model (presented in Appendix A) to examine the competence-loyalty tradeoff faced by the central controller in a two-tier government hierarchy. The controller cares about economic output and political support. His-utility is a weighted average of those two objectives. Government officials in the two tiers carry out different tasks; those in the lower tier are responsible for growing the economy and those in the upper tier are responsible for providing political support. In this highly stylized, we obtain rich predictions that sufficiently distinguish our empirical analysis from the existing literature. In addition to the complexity involving hierarchical selection, the model tells us how selection may change over time when the controller's emphasis evolves from economic growth to loyalty, just like what has happened in China over the last three decades.====Our empirical analysis uses data from the Chinese Officials Dataset collected by the China Center for Economic Research (CCER-COD). The dataset covers virtually all Chinese officials at or above the city level from 1994 to 2017 (Yao et al., 2020). We study the competence-loyalty tradeoff for officials’ promotion at two levels: (1) city to province and (2) province to the center. Competence is defined by an official's ability to grow the economy. We follow Yao and Zhang (2015) to measure officials’ ability by their individual fixed effects in a city/provincial growth equation. Loyalty is more difficult to define. We follow Jia et al. (2015) and Landry et al. (2018) to measure loyalty by personal connections built on the colleagueship between an official and the general party secretary or the members of the standing committee of the politburo. In our baseline definitions of promotion, we find that both ability and connection matter for the promotion of city officials but only connection matters for the promotion of provincial officials. However, there are significant disparities among the three periods corresponding to the tenures of the three general party secretaries. Ability is only significant for 1994–2002 (Jiang's tenure), and connection is only significant for 2013–2017 (Xi's tenure). Neither ability nor connection matter for 2003–2012 (Hu's tenure). Those findings are broadly consistent with the nature of politics and the governing styles in those three periods.====We apply alternative measures of promotion and personal connection and find that most of our baseline results are robust. The major change happens when promotion excludes officials promoted to the legislative and consultative bodies. Here connection no longer matters for the promotion of city officials although it is still significant for the promotion of provincial officials. We also conduct a joint estimation of ability and promotion to deal with possible biases caused by the estimation errors of ability. No qualitative change is found.====Hierarchical selection may entail efficiency losses. We empirically gage that loss in China's system by comparing the group of actually promoted officials with the ideal group of city officials who possessed the best trait (ability or connection) in concern. We find that the efficiency loss of selection on ability has increased and the efficiency loss of selection on connection has declined during the periods of the three party secretaries. The results are further confirmed by the results of simulation and Monte Carlo studies.====This paper makes two sets of contributions to the literature. First, we contribute to the literature on competence-loyalty tradeoff in autocracies. Our key result is that, depending on the autocrat's objective, diversity can exist among lower-rank officials in an autocracy and mediocrity is more likely to exist in the center of power. Second, we make several significant contributions to the literature on China's political selection. Our data cover virtually all the officials at or above the city level and the longest period of time among all the studies—so our results are potentially more robust than those of other studies. While our respective results about ability and connection can be found in the existing literature, we integrate those results in a unified framework and, thus, can provide more comprehensive insights. We have also found a significant time trend in that China's political selection has moved away from competence and has tilted more toward loyalty.====We have organized the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2 provides the heuristic model of the central controller's decision about the competence-loyalty tradeoff in a two-tier bureaucratic hierarchy. Section 3 introduces the data and our measures of ability and connection. Section 4 presents the empirical results about the roles of ability and connection in promotion, and Section 5 presents the empirical, simulation, and Monte Carlo results for efficiency losses of selection and their changes over time.

We measure tariff evasion as the mis-representation of import values in response to increasing tariffs. In a dataset covering 121 countries and the whole set of HS6 product categories in 2012, 2015, and 2017, we show that simplifying border procedures, that is trade facilitation, reduces tariff evasion. Holding tariff rate constant at its mean, improving a country’s overall trade facilitation performance from the 25th percentile to the median reduces tariff evasion by almost 20%. The moderating effect is especially due to improving the pre-shipment legal certainty of customs procedures. Among the potential mechanisms, improving trade facilitation performance is effective in reducing tariff evasion due to under-reporting of import prices, as well as in countries with weaker control of ====. The results suggest that countries can gradually implement trade facilitation reforms to cost-effectively minimize tariff evasion.","Customs agencies worldwide control the cross-border movement of goods and collect taxes. They are important for revenue collection as they can regulate anywhere between 20% and 100% of an economy’s output (Michael, 2012). To protect tariff revenue customs agencies may verify consignments selectively. The delay in clearance due to physical inspections or complicated verification procedures generate extra costs, which can incentivize traders to engage in tariff evasion. The potential losses from tariff evasion are critical for low income countries which rely significantly on trade tariff revenue (Jean and Mitaritonna, 2010).==== Regulating tariff evasion can therefore be critical for public finance in developing countries.====Evidence on the effectiveness of different measures to curb tariff evasion is mixed. For instance, Yang (2008) finds that increased pre-shipping inspection (PSI) in the Philippines incentivized evasion through an alternative duty-avoidance method. Similarly, Javorcik and Narciso (2017) find that WTO accession, which mandates using exporter invoices to undermine arbitrary valuation of merchandise, leads to displacement of tariff evasion to an alternative method. These studies conclude that the overall effect of detection-improving measures on tariff evasion can be insignificant.====This paper contributes to the literature by documenting the effect of simplifying customs procedures on tariff evasion. We hypothesize that easing customs procedures reduces the incentive for traders to avoid high procedural or verification costs through mis-representing consignment value. Indeed, our analysis suggests that simplifying customs procedures moderates tariff evasion.====Our research focuses on the efficacy of provisions listed in the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). The agreement aims to reduce the cost of transaction for traders by reducing border crossing requirements, expediting release of goods, and increasing transparency (Neufeld, 2014).==== The substantive provisions of the agreement include simplifying access to information for traders; encouraging feedback from traders in designing border-related operations; improving legal certainty of border procedures; improving transparency of charges associated with clearing merchandise and penalties for breaching customs regulations; reducing formalities for customs clearance; and improving co-operation between various agencies that regulate movement of goods within and across countries.====The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has compiled eleven country-level trade facilitation indicators (TFIs), which evaluate customs-related policies and their implementation in practice, and which roughly correspond to specific TFA provisions.==== We group these eleven indicators into eight broad measures of trade facilitation: information availability; involvement of the trading community; advance rulings; appeals procedures; fees and charges; formalities; border cooperation; and governance and impartiality. We also compute a simple average of all measures, to create a country-level proxy for the average trade facilitation performance. The average trade facilitation performance measures the overall simplicity of a country’s customs procedures. OECD TFIs are not available annually. We use three waves of TFI data, covering the following years: 2012, 2015, and 2017.====We study how improving trade facilitation affects the mis-representation of import values in response to rising tariff rates. The positive link between the mis-representation of import values and tariff rates is posited as evidence for tariff evasion in the literature. We capture the mis-representation of import value using the discrepancy between the value of exports reported by all exporting countries to the importing country and the value of imports reported by the importing country from all exporting countries. The discrepancy is calculated at the six digit level of the Harmonized System (HS) classification, and is referred to as missing imports. We estimate the effect of trade facilitation measures on the sensitivity of missing imports to the tariff rate in each product category, importer, and year using a dataset that comprises of 121 countries and the entire set of HS6 product categories in three years 2012, 2015 and 2017, for which trade facilitation data have been collected.====The empirical analysis proceeds in several steps. First, we document a positive association between tariff rate and missing imports. The point estimate suggests that a one percentage point increase in tariff rate is associated with 0.2% to 0.3% increase in missing imports. This result, obtained in a large set of countries and products, highlights that tariff evasion is a global phenomenon. Further, our estimate of the tariff semi-elasticity of missing imports is consistent with recent literature, even if we only keep the importer dimension, instead of bilateral exporter–importer dimension in constructing missing imports.====We next examine if country-level trade facilitation measures weaken the positive association between tariff rate and missing imports. Fig. 1 presents preliminary evidence for the moderating effect of trade facilitation performance on tariff evasion (i.e., the positive association between tariff rate and missing imports). It plots missing imports (vertical axis) on the HS6 product tariff rate (horizontal axis). The dashed line represents the relationship for countries that are above the sample median of average trade facilitation performance; the solid line represents the relationship for countries which are below this sample median. In countries with low average trade facilitation performance, we find a positive and statistically significant effect of tariff rate on missing imports. Conversely, in countries with high trade facilitation performance, the slope of the regression line is statistically not different from zero.==== The role of trade facilitation performance in moderating the positive link between tariff rate and missing imports is also substantiated in regression analysis, where we control for unobserved country- and product-specific characteristics that can vary over time, and for unobserved product characteristics that are specific to an importing country. The point estimates imply that, holding tariff rate constant at its mean, improving average trade facilitation performance from the 25th percentile to the median reduces the tariff semi-elasticity of missing imports by almost 20%. We also document that individual trade facilitation measures differ in their effectiveness to reduce tariff evasion. The result is in line with empirical research which shows that some trade facilitation measures are more effective than others in reducing trade costs (Hillberry and Zhang, 2018, Fontagné et al., 2020), and hence should disproportionately affect tariff evasion. We find that pre-shipment legal certainty of border procedures, measured by ‘advance rulings’, is particularly effective in reducing tariff evasion.====We conduct a series of robustness checks to bolster the main findings. We account for the possibility that missing imports in an HS6 product category could affect country-level trade facilitation policy. We address the potential reverse causality by dropping the most important sectors according to their import share in each country. Missing imports in these sectors are most likely to influence trade facilitation policy, and excluding these sectors should minimize the plausible reverse causality. Results show that excluding these sectors has no impact on our baseline findings. We conclude that reverse causality is unlikely to be a factor in our estimations. We also assess our findings in an alternative specification, which is similar to Javorcik and Narciso (2008), and where the United States is used as a reference exporter. The use of a reference exporter ensures that export data are measured consistently. The results are qualitatively similar to our baseline findings and confirm that our results are not affected by how we measure missing imports.====We next examine which potential channels of tariff evasion are sensitive to improving trade facilitation performance. Existing literature identifies three main channels of tariff evasion: mis-classification of the product as a lower tax variety (Fisman and Wei, 2004); under-reporting of import prices (Javorcik and Narciso, 2008; 2017); and under-declaration of import quantities (Rotunno and Vézina, 2012). We find that improving trade facilitation performance is effective in dampening tariff evasion that occurs through under-reporting of import prices.====Finally, we assess if the relationship between trade facilitation and tariff evasion is mediated by other institutional characteristics. In particular, we examine whether the relationship between trade facilitation performance and tariff evasion is sensitive to country-level control of corruption. Importers in countries with weak control of corruption may offer customs officials side payments to avoid detection. We hypothesize that improving trade facilitation performance can reduce the discretionary power of customs officials to apply rules arbitrarily. Hence, improving trade facilitation performance can be particularly effective in reducing tariff evasion in countries with weak control of corruption. Results are in line with this conjecture and confirm that improving trade facilitation performance is more effective in moderating tariff evasion in such countries.====This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. Our main contribution is to the literature on measures to reduce tariff evasion. The literature mostly examines how improving detection can dissuade tariff evasion. For example, a number of papers study the effectiveness of pre-shipment inspections (PSI), that are carried out by private surveillance companies, and were introduced in some low income countries as a precursor to customs reforms (Anson et al., 2006, Ferreira et al., 2007, Yang, 2008, Sequeira, 2016). The literature finds mixed evidence on their efficacy, mostly due to the creation of perverse incentives for importers and customs officers, and due to poor coordination between PSI vendors and customs administrations. More recently, Javorcik and Narciso (2017) studied the mandatory use of export invoices to undermine arbitrary merchandise valuation, following a country’s accession to WTO, and concluded that the overall effect on tariff evasion is insignificant. Our study in contrast examines whether reducing the complexity of customs procedures can improve compliance. We find evidence that simplifying customs procedures can help to reduce customs evasion. The paper thus also relates to a broader public finance literature on tax complexity and compliance (Forest and Sheffrin, 2002, Ulph, 2007, Slemrod, 2007, Slemrod, 2019).====Another contribution is to the empirical literature on the impact of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (Moïsé and Sorescu, 2013, Hillberry and Zhang, 2018, Fontagné et al., 2020). The literature finds that different trade facilitation measures vary in their effectiveness to reduce trade costs. The effectiveness of trade facilitation measures can vary across countries due to the level of development (Moïsé and Sorescu, 2013), or due to the size composition of firms within sectors (Fontagné et al., 2020). We document that while trade facilitation, on average, reduces tariff evasion, not all measures contribute equally. We further show that the impact of average trade facilitation on tariff evasion varies with sector-level characteristics, such as the degree of product differentiation, and with country-level characteristics, such as control of corruption.====We finally contribute to the general literature on tariff evasion. Existing studies either identify tariff evasion among only a few countries (Fisman and Wei, 2004, Javorcik and Narciso, 2008, Rotunno and Vézina, 2012), or their data structure does not account for variation over time (Jean and Mitaritonna, 2010) or differences between product categories (Kellenberg and Levinson, 2019).==== Our work, in contrast, finds evidence for tariff evasion in a dataset that covers 121 countries and all HS6 product categories for three years in the period from 2012 and 2017. We therefore complement the literature and confirm that tariff evasion is a ubiquitous phenomenon.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We address this issue by focussing on stock exchange markets as the predominant type of new equity markets, using a Diff-in-Diff regression method. The analysis uses a panel data set from 48 Sub-Saharan countries over the time range of 1970–2018. 23 countries are part of the “treated” group – which introduced international stock exchanges – and 25 “untreated” countries serve as the control group. Our results show that when compared with the time period prior to the introduction of stock exchange markets, GDP per capita rises by the amount of 532 US$ (around 40% of the Sub-Saharan average) after the introduction of equity capital markets in the treated countries. Over the ten years post introduction, the effect is hump-shaped, with effects becoming statistically significant from the first year after implementation, with a peak in the 5th year, and it then becomes statistically insignificant from then onwards.","The correlation between economic growth and equity capital markets has been brought to evidence in different empirical studies in the past. Fuchs-Schündeln and Funke (2001), focussing on existing, but liberalised stock markets concluded that there is a temporary positive effect of such liberalisation on real GDP growth. These authors based their study on a sample of 26 countries from all over the world. The empirical evidence was confirmed for the countries from the Middle East and North Africa (henceforth MENA region, Naceur et al., 2008) where the focus of the research was centred on the pre-and post-development of those economies that introduced equity capital markets. To date, the effect of introducing stock exchange markets as a determinant of economic growth has not been researched for the case of Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper addresses this issue, and adds to the literature by focussing on stock markets as the predominant type of new equity markets.====The motivation behind our research question lies within the fact that most of the Sub-Saharan countries implemented their stock exchange markets very recently. The countries mainly belong to the developing countries group, where it is of interest to analyse whether the introduction of such financial markets has significant positive effects on economic growth. The introduction of international stock exchanges affects GDP throughout different channels. They improve accounting standards and disclosure transparency, enforce property rights, strengthen legal and judicial systems for investor protection, attract foreign and local equity capital, and increase the domestic institutional investor base.====Hence, history has proved that liberalisation of markets leads to more stability and sustainable economic growth in a single case study of Sub-Saharan Uganda (Atingi-Ego and Kasekende, 1999), but the term “market liberalisation” is very broad: For instance, it may happen over decades in the form of opening the borders for trade. Then it is an important ingredient for industrialisation, fighting unemployment and regional specialisation of production (Shafaeddin, 2010). Specifically, for Sub-Saharan countries which are used in our research sample, in recent years the decrease in trade barriers have led to an expansion of exports fostering economic growth (e.g., Babatunde, 2009). The incentive of this study however focuses on another aspect of liberalisation, the introduction of stock exchange markets on GDP per capita, and growth of GDP per capita. While this topic has been addressed using several samples of different countries (Fuchs-Schündeln and Funke, 2001), it has not been addressed for a large set of Sub-Saharan countries and using the Diff-in-Diff method.====The Diff-in-Diff approach is actually a promising empirical identification strategy for assessing these effects. The source of variation in this setting is derived from the comparison of economic growth prior to, and past the introduction of stock exchange markets, and from the comparison of a group of treated countries (that implemented stock markets) versus control countries (that did not implement stock markets). When estimating the coefficient for “treated” countries we control for variables such as the value added over time for different sectors, foreign direct investment net inflows, and domestic credit to private sector, as well as net official development assistance. This is to ensure that the common trend assumption is fulfilled. These control variables directly correlate with both GDP per capita and the introduction of international stock exchange markets and thus they are necessary to estimate unbiased coefficients.====Our results are robust and presume that the introduction of international stock exchange markets have a significant impact on the level of GDP per capita. For treated countries, the GDP per capita increases around 532 US$ post market implementation. In economic terms, this is considerable, given that it constitutes an increase greater than 40% when compared to the average GDP per capita of all Sub-Saharan countries over the period of 1970–2018. We then repeat the regression to measure the impact of an introduction of an international stock exchange on the GDP per capita growth. In this approach, we find the introduction of international capital markets on GDP per capita growth to be significant at a 5% level when including control variables. Post -implementation, treated countries display a growth rate of 0.9%. This positive relationship is coherent with the results of Fuchs-Schündeln and Funke (2001) who carried out a similar regression on market liberalisation, however they controlled for policy reforms.====Based on our results, we deepen our analysis by assessing how variable this effect is over time. To do this, we apply the empirical strategy of Fuchs-Schündeln and Funke (2001). This way we can capture whether the effect of introducing stock markets on economic growth is limited or sustainable over time. Our regression suggests that at the start, in the very year of market introduction, the effect on the GDP per capita level is statistically non-significant, with a coefficient of around 407 US$. It then follows a hump-shape, by starting to be statistically and economically significant from Year 1, after the introduction onwards, and then reaches a peak in Year 5. This result is coherent with the work of Fuchs-Schündeln and Funke (2001), who found that the effect of liberalisation on GDP per capita growth reaches its peak in Year 4. However, the effect seems to be limited to the first five years after introduction. From Year 6 onwards, the effect is no longer statistically significant and the coefficient decreases, which implies that the long-term effect of the introduction of international stock exchange markets on GDP per capita is limited to the results achieved within the first five years.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 summarises the relevant literature; Section 3 provides a brief overview of stock exchange markets and the economic status of Sub-Saharan countries in general; Section 4 describes the empirical methodology and is followed by the results in Section 5; Finally, Section 6 concludes.",Does the introduction of stock exchange markets boost economic growth in African countries?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000051,25 January 2022,2022,Research Article,69.0

This paper examines fiscal adjustment to debt and deficits for a panel of 17 countries over 1870–2016 using the Jordà–Schularick–Taylor Macrohistory Database. This long span panel is informative since it contains many examples of large fiscal shocks similar to those recently experienced. The results from reduced-form models suggest that large deficits or surpluses tend to prompt stabilising feedbacks, mainly through changes in revenue, and there is greater pressure to adjust on countries running a deficit versus those running a surplus. However, the debt–GDP ratio prompts much less stabilising feedback by expenditure or revenue.","The financial crisis from 2007 and, even more so, the Covid-19 pandemic increased ==== and reduced revenue by large amounts in many countries. This rapid growth in public sector deficits and debts prompted concern about the sustainability of public finances, the solvency of national governments and the likely fiscal adjustments.====Solvency conditions have been analysed by performing unit root and cointegration tests on fiscal and external deficit time series (====, ====, ====). These papers use tests for stationarity and cointegration to check whether the intertemporal budget constraint (IBC), which guarantees that the debt is backed by the expected present value of future primary surpluses, is satisfied. The issue however, is that the intertemporal budget constraint is a weak condition as it can be satisfied for series of any order of integration (====, ====). Hence, Bohn argues that the standard time series tests are fairly useless for analysing fiscal sustainability, because since higher order of integration can never be completely ruled out, these tests can never credibly reject the consistency of data with the IBC (i.e. sustainability).==== (====, ==== concluded that from the empirical side, the most credible evidence in favour of fiscal sustainability is the robust positive response of primary surpluses to increase in debt–GDP ratio. He explained that if the fiscal policy is sufficiently “responsive” to accumulation of debt, meaning the government takes corrective actions by increasing surplus to meet increasing interest payments, then it can be concluded that the primary surplus has an error-correction representation (====). This paper uses an error-correction model to examine not only how surpluses (deficits) adjust to debt, but how they respond to their own lagged values.====The analysis uses data for 17 countries for 1870–2016, from the Jordà–Schularick–Taylor, JST, Macrohistory Database, to examine the adjustment of surplus, revenue and expenditure to changes in the lagged surplus and lagged debt. The patterns of adjustment are estimated for the whole period and then for three shorter sub-periods: 1870–1914, 1915–1950 and 1951–2016.====Overall, it appears that large deficits do tend to adjust to shocks in a stabilising way, mainly through revenue, not expenditure. However, there does not seem to be a significant feedback to debt, suggesting that there might not be an equilibrium level of debt–GDP. This is not surprising, since different countries do maintain very different debt–GDP ratios. It is also consistent with the idea emphasised by ==== (====, ====While the true solvency condition might be of an economic nature, depending on expectations, the statistical analysis of fiscal adjustment is still of some interest, particularly in the light of the effects of the 2020 pandemic.

By unbundling the mechanisms of risk sharing, we find that ==== risk sharing matters only for state-owned enterprises. This result remains robust to instrument variable estimation and controlling for other determinants of industrial specialization. Finally, we show that interregional labor migration (special fiscal transfers) plays an important role in promoting interregional ==== (====) risk sharing. The study implies that much more risk sharing and efficiency gains from industrial specialization would be achieved if capital markets and credit markets are better developed.","The importance of production risk insurance in gaining benefits from industrial specialization is widely recognized (Brainard and Cooper, 1968; Ruffin, 1974; Helpman and Razin, 1978). Specialization helps achieve higher economic growth but incur a greater variance of output (Saint-Paul, 1992). In the absence of insurance of production risks, the welfare losses due to the latter would outweigh the benefits brought by industrial specialization. If regions and countries can insure their idiosyncratic production risks, they are able to better explore comparative advantage by specializing in their productions (Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990; Saint-Paul, 1992; Obstfeld, 1994; Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 1997). Consistently, Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2003) provide evidence that more insurance is associated with higher specialization. Yet, the economic mechanism is yet to be well understood.====Theoretically, there are two ways to smooth regional output fluctuations in a market economy (Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2003). First, residents in a region can geographically diversify their revenue sources among regions, primarily through capital markets, thereby insuring their income and smoothing their consumption (====). Second, in response to income fluctuations (temporary shocks), residents in a region can mainly borrow or lend through credit markets to smooth their consumption (====) (Asdrubali et al., 1996). No effort has been made to unbundle these two mechanisms of risk sharing. Our main task is to demonstrate empirically the relative importance of ==== vs ==== risk sharing in promoting industrial specialization.====This issue is particularly relevant for emerging market economies and developing countries. In advanced economies, the well-developed capital markets and credit markets serve as the primary instruments of ==== and ==== risk sharing, respectively. They are both market-based mechanisms so that the government plays a minor role in achieving risk sharing. In contrast, emerging market economies and developing countries are typically characterized with financial repression where financial system is under excessive government control and intervention and highly underdeveloped. Government ownership or control of domestic banks is prevalent. Interest rates are subject to explicit or indirect capping so that banks can provide cheap loans to privileged large companies and governments. Equity markets and bond markets either do not exist or remain small. Excessive government control of and intervention in securities markets are prevalent. Under these circumstances, capital markets and credit markets can hardly benefit non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs), especially those small and medium-sized ones and large swathes of urban and rural households. They are thus hardly capable of shouldering heavy responsibilities of achieving ==== and ==== risk sharing and supporting industrial specialization. Alternatively, labor migration, especially rural-urban migration, and the resultant remittances play a significant part in diversifying income sources and become an important means of ==== risk sharing (Du et al., 2011; Balli and Rana, 2015). Special fiscal transfers and government aid become a primary means of ==== risk sharing in maintaining consumption in the wake of negative shocks. This pattern demonstrates that ==== risk sharing relies primarily on the market-based mechanism, while ==== risk sharing on the government-orchestrated mechanism in emerging market economies and developing countries. Thus, the prevalent state-owned or state-controlled companies in these economies may benefit disproportionately from the government-administered ==== risk sharing mechanism, whereas their non-state counterparts from the market-based ==== mechanism. Consequently, the geographic concentration of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and that of non-SOEs could be significantly shaped by the ==== and ==== risk sharing mechanism, respectively.====Using a large data set of China's manufacturing firms for the period 2003−2015, we empirically investigate the impacts of both ==== and ==== risk sharing on geographic concentration of manufacturing activities. The case of China provides a unique opportunity among emerging market economies to gage which risk sharing (==== vs ==== is more closely related to production specialization. For instance, under repressive financial policies, China's state-dominated banking system channels formal credit to SOEs, while small and median-sized enterprises (SMEs) find it difficult to obtain bank credits (He et al., 2017), which is also typical for developing economies. China still has a dual-economy structure in which rural-urban migration plays an essential part in relieving rural poverty, a feature common to underdeveloped economies. Understanding China could have valuable policy implications for other emerging market economies.====In addition, China is a large country that includes all manufacturing industries====. Industrial agglomeration across China's cities differs substantially (Lu and Tao, 2009; He et al., 2017). A large prefecture-level city sample and differentiated industrial patterns facilitate our empirical analysis, and such investigation is carried out by using consistent measures of risk sharing and industrial classification without a concern over measurement errors and estimation biases which are typically encountered in a cross-country analysis. Finally, the variation in the extent of risk sharing among provinces within China is similar to that across countries (Du et al., 2011), and the barrier to risk sharing across provinces is comparable to that across countries====, making a study in the context of China valuable for both regional and international studies.====Following Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2003), we define a risk sharing group as a country (China) consisting of numerous regions (Cities), and calculate the income-based and consumption-based measures to proxy the degree of the ==== and ==== risk sharing among cities within China. We then calculate an index of industrial specialization for each city within China, and check whether a city's degree of risk sharing with the other cities in China is positively associated with the city's degree of industrial production concentration. The results show that a better risk sharing entails a higher degree of industrial specialization. This effect is more pronounced in regions with a greater extent of income-based risk sharing (==== risk sharing). In contrast, the role of consumption-based risk sharing (==== risk sharing) is more limited, and exerts no salient effects on the overall industrial specialization. In addition, we find that ==== risk sharing has significant positive effects on regional specialization in cities with economic development zones, and the positive effect is more pronounced in cyclical industries.====Taking advantage of our detailed data, we further examine the industrial specialization of SOEs and non-SOEs, and find that ==== and ==== risk sharing enhance the industrial specialization of non-SOEs and SOEs, respectively. This is consistent with our observation that the ==== risk sharing channel is primarily market-based while the ==== one is mainly government-administered in China's emerging market economy.====Our results remain robust after controlling for a variety of traditional determinants of industrial specialization. Similar results are obtained by using alternative measures for industrial specialization as well as adopting various regression specifications. To guard the potential endogeneity problems, we search for instrumental variables (IVs) that are likely to be exogenous to industrial specialization. Specifically, we use the number of genealogies in each city and the distance between local dialect and Beijing Mandarin as two alternative instrumental variables for risk sharing. We also control for other traditional determinants of regional specialization. The positive relations between ==== risk sharing as well as the total risk sharing and industrial specialization still survive.====Finally, we show that the interregional labor migration and special fiscal transfers play an important role in promoting inter-city ==== and ==== risk sharing, respectively, which verifies that the ==== and ==== risk sharing channels are primarily market-based and government-controlled ones, respectively, in China.====Our study makes several contributions to the literature on risk sharing and industrial specialization. First, this study is the first one to explicitly examine the effects of ==== and ==== risk sharing on industrial specialization separately. Previous studies on risk sharing typically focus on examining the effects of risk sharing on economic activities or identifying the effects via different channels of risk sharing separately. For instance, several studies show that a full risk sharing leads to significant welfare gains (Backus et al., 1992; Obstfeld, 1994; Asdrubali et al., 1996; Lewis, 1996; Crucini, 1999). Kalemli-ozcan et al. (2003) find that the extent of risk sharing is positively related to industrial specialization. Hevia and Servén (2018) relates the degree of risk sharing to macro variables, and finds that higher risk sharing improves the gain from globalization. Asdrubali et al. (1996) identify the channels through capital market, federal government and credit market, and further estimate the components effect of risk sharing in achieving their current degree of risk sharing. Du et al. (2011) and Du et al. (2010) have documented different channels of risk sharing in China and the role of financial markets in achieving risk sharing. Asdrubali et al. (2018) investigate how government consumption smooths out macroeconomic shocks.====Our study complements and extends the literature by unbundling how ==== and ==== risk sharing help shape the patterns of industrial specialization. Kalemli-ozcan et al. (2003) has suggested the effects of ==== and ==== risk sharing on industrial specialization. However, they use a measure of income insurance (====) and, alternatively, a measure of overall consumption insurance (the whole risk sharing) in the empirical analysis. The difference in the impacts between ==== and ==== risk sharing on industrial specialization remains unexplored.====Second, this study further links ==== risk sharing and ==== risk sharing to both market-based risk sharing channels and the government-administered risk sharing channels. The market force and government intervention interact solidly throughout the reform of China, providing an excellent setting for examining how ==== and ==== risk sharing affect economic activities.====In China's emerging market economy, the conventional primary market-based risk sharing mechanisms, namely, capital markets and credit markets, do not play a significant role in attaining risk sharing. This mainly reflects the underdevelopment of capital markets in China, and the SOE-oriented banking system that has not benefited much non-SOE businesses and households. It is mainly migrant labor's remittances and intergovernmental special transfers constitute the primary channels of ==== and ==== risk sharing, respectively. In general, they are relatively primitive forms of risk sharing. Consequently, the ==== risk sharing hinges on market forces, while the ==== risk sharing relies on the government's actions. Consequently, the extent of both ==== and ==== risk sharing achieved is still limited, which deters industrial specialization and economic growth and results in substantial efficiency losses. This demonstrates an additional negative effect of an underdeveloped financial system which is often ignored in the literature.====Third, a large body of literature has examined the determinants of industrial specialization (Harrigan, 1999; Davis and Weinstein, 1999; Harrigan and Zakrajsek, 2000; van Riet et al., 2004). Besides the traditional determinants, such as production factor endowment, technology and knowledge, economic development, researchers have turned their attention to other determinants. New economic geography (Krugman, 1991) points out the role of economic liberalization in sharpening specialization, and a number of studies investigate the relationship between (financial and trade) openness and specialization (Imbs, 2004; Masten et al., 2008). Brülhart and Trionfetti (2001) focus on how the discriminatory public procurement affects the location of industries. Recently, various studies sought to explore the policy and institutional factors in the distribution of the industrial firms (Duranton and Puga, 2004; Johansson and Olaberría, 2014; Chor, 2010; Nunn and Trefler, 2014; He et al., 2017; Fan et al., 2021). Our study contributes to the literature by focusing on the mechanism of how risk sharing affects industrial specialization, and how risk sharing functions along with government intervention. We show that the market-based ==== risk sharing contributes to the industrial specialization of non-SOEs, while the government-administered ==== risk sharing shapes the industrial specialization of SOEs. China's experience has general implications for other economies, especially emerging market economies and developing countries.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops our hypotheses. We describe the dataset, variable measures and summary statistics for key variables in Section 3. Section 4 investigates the impact of risk sharing as well as other factors on city-level industrial specialization. Robustness and sensitivity analyzes are carried out in Section 5.

Using disaster frequency as an instrument for Protestant distribution, we find stronger IV results. We further find that although improvements in education and health care account for a sizable portion of the total effects, other channels such as transformed social values may also matter. Our findings acknowledge the pioneering effects of missionary work in China's modernization, and imply that China's recent growth may benefit from of human capital and social values acquired in history.","One of the most contentious issues with respect to the effects of religion on economic growth is the role of Protestantism. Much of the debate has focused on whether the rise of Protestantism has had any causal effect on long-term economic growth in predominantly Christian nations. In ====, Max Weber (2001) suggested that Reformed Protestantism, by promoting stronger societal preferences for hard work and thrift, has led to greater economic prosperity in Western societies. Some recent studies echo Weber's and suggest that religious beliefs may have fostered certain moral codes or social values that are conducive to economic growth (Stulz and Williamson, 2003; Barro and McCleary, 2003; McCleary and Barro, 2006a, 2006b; Arruñada, 2010). But some other studies either find no significant causal effects between Protestantism and economic growth (Cantoni, 2015), or show that the causal effects are driven by the by-products of Protestantism (e.g., the accumulation of human capital that may result from reading the Bible) instead of the religion per se (Glaeser and Sacerdote, 2008; Becker and Woessmann, 2009).====An equally interesting question revolves around how the expansion of Protestantism has affected economic growth in peripheral nations and, more specifically, in non-Christian societies. Throughout their history, Christian missionaries have attempted to transplant Protestantism—together with Western science, technology, culture, and institutions—into peripheral nations, many of which have had long-established indigenous religions, cultures, and institutions of their own. Despite countless clashes and compromises, Protestantism has deeply transformed some of these societies and generated persistent, significant impacts to their economic growth.====Yet the prospect of conducting an empirical examination of the effects of Protestantism on long-term economic growth in peripheral nations can be daunting because of the scarcity of within-country data on nations that are suitable for such study. Even when within-country data are available, establishing causality between Protestantism and long-term economic growth is difficult because of the issue of endogeneity. It is possible, for example, that more developed regions attracted more Protestant activity in the past, and that they continue to perform better in the present.====In this study, we examine whether the spread of Protestantism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had a persistent impact on China's recent economic growth and, if it did, what mechanisms were involved. Studying the long-term effects of Protestantism in China is valuable for two reasons. First, China provides an ideal setting for studying within-country variations in religious activities and socioeconomic development. Throughout its history, China has been a large country with a relatively homogeneous culture and a uniform political system, yet its socioeconomic development has been quite heterogeneous. The Chinese setting thus provides variations large enough to conduct clean empirical tests and thereby examine the role of religion on long-term socioeconomic development. Second, the transplantation of Protestantism to a vast peripheral nation such as China has been, to some extent, a quasi-natural experiment. Chinese culture was dominated by Confucianism for thousands of years. Christianity was prohibited until late in the nineteenth century, when China was defeated by Western powers and forced to open its doors to foreign trade and influences. Thereafter, foreign missionaries self-selected to go to different Chinese counties and evangelize Chinese people. Yet missionary activities turn out to have constituted a largely external and exogenous intervention, both in China's economy and in its society. This feature allows us to examine the long-lasting effects of a sudden and exogenous historical event on socioeconomic development today. In this regard, our research contributes to a large body of literature on the effects of historical events on current economic developments that includes the works of Acemoglu et al. (2001, 2005), Nunn (2008), Dell (2010), and Jia (2014).====In this paper, we marshal county-level data on Protestant presence in 1920 from original historical survey materials, and then match these data with recent data on developments in the economy, education, and health care in 2000. Our OLS results show strong positive correlation between the historical Protestant presence and current economic outcome. By themselves, however, these correlations do not prove that Protestantism caused China's subsequent socioeconomic development; they may simply reflect it. It might be possible that more developed counties attracted more Protestant activities in the past, and that they continue to perform better at present. We tackle the endogeneity issue in three ways. First, we investigate the historical record, which suggests missionaries were usually more inclined to go to less developed areas. Second, we proxy historical economic prosperity by population density and land tax revenues of Chinese counties, and we find no positive correlation between historical economic prosperity and Protestant presence. Third, in light of the fact that missionaries purposefully undertook disaster relief work to gain the trust of Chinese people, we use the frequency of severe droughts and floods in the early twentieth century as the instrument for the intensity of Protestant presence across counties. Our IV coefficients are positive and significant, suggesting that more Protestant activities in 1920 produced better economic, educational, and health care outcomes in 2000.====We then investigate the precise channels through which the impacts of Protestant activities in 1920 have survived China's political turbulence and managed to persist into the present. Our investigations of historical facts and our empirical tests suggest that a greater Protestant presence results in better education and health care outcomes in 1920, and that these effects might have persisted into the present and contributed to economic growth in 2000. While proselytizing in remote inland counties, missionaries also worked to help local people build modern educational and health systems and to diffuse Western science and technologies. Such efforts accelerated modernization in many Chinese counties, contributed to the accumulation of human capital, and reshaped the social values of local people.==== Although missionary work was suppressed during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, the human capital and social values that had been transformed by Protestant activities might continue to contribute to local economic development, especially after the Reform and Open-up in the late 1970s. Such economic development made it possible for higher education and health inputs, leading to a self-strengthening interaction between these socioeconomic factors. Our further empirical tests corroborate that while education and health care outcomes have accounted for a significant part of the effects of Protestantism on economic development in 2000, missionaries’ undertakings have also affected economic outcomes through other complex channels. Many of those effects are difficult to quantify, but they might have played an indispensable role in enhancing long-term economic growth.====If we are correct, our conclusions have important implications for understanding China's spurt of economic growth since 1978. This growth, the so-called Chinese miracle, is usually attributed entirely to the Reform and Open-up, a series of radical institutional changes that began in the late 1970s. Our findings imply that (1) China's Reform and Open-up was to a large extent a continuation of a modernization movement that started in the mid-nineteenth century but was disrupted by wars and political turbulence, and (2) Protestant missionaries pioneered that modernization movement by introducing Western-style education, health care, science, technology, and social values to China. Missionaries disseminated Western science, technology, and social values to even the most remote parts of China, and they fostered the accumulation of certain types of human capital that have been conducive to modern economic growth. The historical legacies of human capital and social values that were acquired from missionaries’ undertakings almost a century ago continue to promote economic growth at the present time. Therefore, we concur with Brandt et al. (2014) when they attribute “China's recent economic success to a combination of beneficial historic legacies, recent accumulations of capital, skill, and policy expertise, and important economic and political changes that facilitated the realization of old and new potentials.”====To our knowledge, the closest study to our paper is Bai and Kung (2015), which studies how the diffusion of Protestantism has contributed economic prosperity in the early 20th century. There are three features that differentiate our research from Bai and Kung (2015). Firstly, the identification strategy we use are different. Bai and Kung (2015) leverage the predicted fled path of missionaries after the Boxer Uprising (1900) as an exogenous factor in determining the geographical distribution of Christian activities later on. By contrast, we explore missionaries’ emphasis on disaster relieve and use historical natural disaster to generate exogenous variations in Christian activities across locations. Secondly, the time horizon of our studies are different. Bai and Kung (2015) documents missionaries’ endeavors in introducing western education and medicine to China and focus on their short-term effects on urbanization and number of modern industrial firms in the first two decades of the 20th century. We extend their study by looking at the historical legacy of the missionaries’ efforts in the long run economic development measured by GDP per capita in the year 2000. Thirdly, Bai and Kung (2015) finds that almost all short run economic gains can be explained by knowledge diffusion thanks to missionaries’ activities. Our results suggest that, when we study the long-run economic outcome impacts of diffusion of Christianity, there exists more complicated channels beyond the introduction of modern education and medical science.====In the next section, we provide historical background on the spread of Protestantism during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 establishes the causal relationship between historical Protestantism and contemporary economic development. Section 5 explores the effects of Protestantism on educational development. Section 6 explores the effects of Protestantism on medical development. Section 7 examines other channels through which historical Protestantism has contributed to contemporary economic growth.

The New Two-Child Policies gradually allowed all couples to have two children. This paper investigates the impact of the New Two-Child Policies on individual behavior related to birth and maternal labor supply. We find number of children significantly increased after the implementation of the New Two-Child Policies. Using the New Two-Child Policies as an exogenous variation in fertility, we find negative effect of number of children on maternal labor supply in both extensive and intensive margin. Our results have important implications for the further relaxation of birth-control policies.","The improvement of women's socioeconomic status is important for poverty reduction, children's development and gender equality in developing countries. Female labor force participation is associated with welfare not only for females themselves but also for the next generation. The family planning policies started in the last century contribute a lot to the reduction of fertility and improvement of women's economic status. However, the working-age population shrinks fast due to low birthrate in most developing and developed countries. The relaxation of birth-control policies and the encouragement of birth become the new trend in population policy-making.====In China, the relaxation of the One-Child Policy in urban areas started in 2014. Before 2014, only couples that both partners are the only child can have two children.==== The policy that couples with only one partner being the only child can have a second birth was proposed in December of 2013 and implemented in 2014. The universal two-child policy that all couples can have two children was declared at the end of 2015 and became effective in 2016. These relaxation policies are called the New Two-Child Policies and tend to have big influences on individual and household economic behavior. This paper investigates the impact of the New Two-Child Policies on birth and maternal labor supply.====In the studies that examine the relaxation of the birth-control policy, Qin and Wang (2017) finds limited impacts of the two-child experiment in the 1980s in a county in Shanxi Province on birth rate, Cao (2019) find the one-and-a-half-child policy reduces maternal labor supply in rural China,==== Wang et al. (2017) simulates the change in working-age population under the universal Two-Child Policy, Agarwal et al. (2020) uses an employer-employee matched data from a major city in China and finds employers hire fewer female employees after the relaxation of the One-Child Policy in 2013. This paper differs from these studies and uses nation-wide survey data to examine how fertility and maternal labor supply in urban China respond to the New Two-Child Policies in 2010s.====Related theoretical models predict a negative relationship between fertility and labor supply (Borjas, 2000). Empirical studies generally find that having more children lowers females’ labor supply in developed countries (Angrist and Evans, 1998; Killingsworth and Heckman, 1986; Lundborg et al., 2017). However, mixed evidence is found in developing countries. Caceres-Delpiano (2012) finds that having children has a negative effect on female employment, while Aguero and Marks (2011) finds that the presence of children does not affect female labor supply. Heath (2017) finds that fertility decreases labor supply on the extensive margin but increases working hours for women in urban Ghana. In China, Margaret et al. (2011) and Cao (2019) find negative effects of having young children on women's labor supply, while He and Zhu, (2016) and Guo et al. (2018) do not find significant effects. Family structure is often used to explain the insignificant impact of fertility on female labor supply. The extended family members, such as grandparents, play an important role in raising children. The New Two-Child Policies in 2010s tend to increases the number of children one couple has and consequently increase the burden of raising children. Many mothers who gave birth to a second child after the New Two-Child Policies are usually in their late 30s. Their parents may be too old to provide help in caring of one additional child. How maternal labor supply responds to birth would be different than before.====The major problem in the identification of the impact of fertility on labor supply is the endogeniety of number of children. On one hand, the woman who has a higher level of labor supply tend to have a higher opportunity cost of bearing children and be less likely to have a second child. On the other hand, the income effect of a working mother may increase the demand of children. Literature uses gender composition of children, twin data, IVF treatment and population policies to identify the causal relationship between fertility and labor supply (Angrist and Evans, 1998; Guo et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 1999; Lundborg et al., 2017). In this paper, we exploit the implementation of the New Two-Child Policies in 2010s to construct instruments for number of children. These policies are exogenous to labor supply and are enforced gradually across different groups. Couples are allowed to have a second child earlier if one of partners is the only child. The interaction term between the eligibility of having a second child and the years after being eligible would be considered as the instrumental variable.====In this paper, we begin with the analysis of the effect of the New Two-Child Policies on the number of children one woman has. The heterogeneity effect of the New Two-Child Polices on fertility across different birth order, age, education, income and Hukou status are examined. Then, we use the New Two-Child Policies to construct an instrumental variable for number of children and examine its impact on maternal labor supply. We find negative effects of fertility on maternal labor supply in both extensive and intensive margin. By contrast, paternal labor force participation is not affected and fathers’ length of working is positively affected by number of children. The New Two-Child Policies may have a direct effect on labor supply other than the effect through fertility. We examine other possible channels such as the discrimination against females in labor market and the direct effect of being the one-child generation on labor supply. We do not find evidence that supports these channels. Subsequently, we examine the heterogeneous impacts of fertility on labor supply for different birth order and child gender. Finally, we discuss the reasons for the reduction of maternal labor supply under the New Two-Child Policies. The lack of pre-school childcare by formal institutions, the aging of grandparents who used to play an important role in raising children, and the rising cost of baby-sitters might explain the negative impact of birth on maternal labor supply.====This paper contributes to three strands of literature. First, our paper is related to the identification of the causal relationship between fertility and female labor supply. Gender composition, twin data, IVF treatment and population policies are often used to identify the effect of fertility on labor supply (Angrist and Evans, 1998; Guo et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 1999; Li and Zhang, 2006; Lundborg et al., 2017). Comparing with the studies that use family planning policies to identify the causal effect of fertility on female labor supply, we focus on the New Two-Child Policies in China and exploit the variation in the timing of implementation. Second, our paper is related to the impact of population policy on household economic behavior. Related studies generally focus on the impact of the birth-control policies (such as the One-Child Policy) on fertility, child quality, sex-ratio, labor supply, and household investment behavior (Ebenstein, 2010; Li et al., 2011; McElroy and Yang, 2000; Wu and Zhao, 2020; Zhang, 2017). This paper studies how the relaxation of the birth-control policy affects fertility and labor supply. Third, our paper contributes to the understanding of the declines in female labor force participation. Since 1990, female labor force participation in China has been declining. Factors such as childcare, gender of children, housing price, and social norms are important determinants for the reduction of female labor supply (Chen and Ge, 2018; Du and Dong, 2010; Fu et al., 2016; Wang, 2019). We add the role of the new population policies in 2010s to this literature.====The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the background. Section 3 presents the data and empirical strategy. Section 4 discusses the effect of the New Two-Child Policies on fertility. Section 5 presents the results of the effect on labor supply. Section 6 briefly concludes.",Fertility and maternal labor supply: Evidence from the new two-child policies in urban China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596722000026,10 January 2022,2022,Research Article,73.0

Using panel data from 80 countries over the period of 1990–2016, we uncover the electoral cycles in macroprudential policy. We show that a loosening in macroprudential policy becomes more likely in the pre-election year, especially in countries with lower institutional quality. There is no evidence for the reversal of such actions in the post-election year. We also find that capital account openness, the history of macroprudential policy actions and ","Whether incumbent governments engage in pre-election manipulation of economic policies in an effort to get re-elected is a popular empirical question of electoral politics. In this paper, we tackle this question for a specific type of economic policy tool whose main goal is to contain the systemic risk in the financial system, namely macroprudential policy. Using a large panel dataset, we show evidence on the presence of electoral cycles in macroprudential policy, especially when institutions are weak. We also shed light on various other determinants of the strength of electoral cycles in macroprudential policy, such as past policy actions, macroeconomic factors and political environment. The evidence we provide suggests that political pressures can create a challenge in designing and implementing the macroprudential toolkit.====The concept of an electoral cycle arises from the notion that governments can try to use various policy tools available to them to boost the economic activity before elections, if they believe that this will help them get re-elected. This can in turn create a cycle in economic policies characterized by expansionary patterns right before elections. However, this kind of policy manipulation works only under some circumstances: e.g. when voters are short-sighted, have short memory, cannot directly observe the competence of elected officials etc.==== If such conditions are not satisfied, thus if incumbent governments are unlikely to reap any short-term political dividend from such policies, then they may not be willing to engage in this type of policy manipulation in the first place. Hence, whether this phenomenon – where political interference leads to changes in economic policies based on the timing of elections, thereby causing an electoral cycle in these policies – actually exists or not is ultimately an empirical question.====This question is indeed a very popular one and there is a huge literature on electoral cycles in economic policy. However, the extant literature almost exclusively investigates electoral cycles in fiscal and monetary policies. We contribute to this literature by focusing on electoral cycles in macroprudential policy, where macroprudential policy is defined as the set of tools that aim to mitigate the risk to the financial system as a whole (systemic risk). We believe this is an important issue, because even though there is widespread agreement (particularly after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis) that setting macroprudential policy tight enough is crucial in reducing the accumulation of systemic risk and in turn avoiding financial crises,==== macroprudential tightening may generate short-run costs (in the form of lower economic output), which can be perceived by incumbent governments as reducing their chances of re-election. Hence, incumbent governments may choose to loosen macroprudential policy before elections to raise economic output in the short run, even when the potential long-run cost of loosening macroprudential policy (in the form of increased likelihood of financial crises) is much larger.====What makes this issue even more interesting is that macroprudential policy can be an “ideal” policy tool by incumbent governments to manipulate before elections for several reasons. For instance, compared to a monetary policy rate cut, changes in macroprudential policy are less visible to voters. Moreover, as opposed to an expansion in fiscal policy, changes in macroprudential policy have no direct/immediate effect on the government budget deficit.==== Given these potential benefits to the incumbent, the investigation of macroprudential policy manipulation before elections is potentially just as important as the investigation of fiscal and monetary policy manipulation. We therefore conclude that the empirical question we investigate in this paper – whether incumbent governments actually use macroprudential policy as a tool to win elections – is an open and important one.====The first of our main empirical findings in this paper is that the probability of a loosening in macroprudential policy increases one year before the election,==== with this pre-election year effect being particularly pronounced in countries with lower institutional quality. This result is not likely to be driven by omitted variables or reverse causality, and remains the same across a large battery of robustness checks.==== The size of the impact is economically large, where the pre-election year probability of a loosening in macroprudential policy can more than double the overall loosening probability across the sample, especially in cases of low institutional quality. More specifically, our estimates suggest that the probability of a loosening in macroprudential policy increases in the pre-election year by up to 10.6 percentage points in countries with low institutional quality. It is above the overall probability of a loosening in the sample, which is 7.6%. This effect weakens and finally disappears as institutional quality increases.====Our reasoning on this result is that the existence of electoral cycles in macroprudential policy may crucially depend on the extent to which the executive branch (who is trying to get re-elected) is able to pressure the authorities that set macroprudential policy. The ability of the executive branch to pressure these authorities is potentially higher in countries with lower institutional quality and fewer constraints on the executive. As a result, we are more likely to observe stronger electoral cycles of macroprudential policy in such countries. This finding points out that macroprudential policy is not immune to political influence, particularly when institutional quality is not high enough, and that strong institutions can shield it from political pressures.====We also investigate what happens to macroprudential policy after the election. We do not find evidence of a further loosening in macroprudential policy in the post-election year, indicating that our finding on the pre-election loosening is indeed driven by the pressure of upcoming elections on the executive. We also do not find evidence of a reversal (a tightening) in macroprudential policy in the post-election year.====Our second main empirical result is that financially less open countries experience a stronger effect of elections on the probability of loosening in macroprudential policy. This is consistent with the recent literature finding evidence that financially more open economies are more subject to global conditions, undermining the role of domestic policy actions in the case of monetary and financial policies.==== The existing evidence in the literature specific to macroprudential policies also points to a similar fact. In financially more integrated economies, macroprudential policy is subject to cross-border effects (Caruana, 2010, IMF, 2013), such as leakages and potentially undesirable spillovers of policy actions from other countries, which can undermine the role of domestic action in the domestic financial and economic performance. As a result, macroprudential policy actions appear to be less effective in economies with relatively more open financial systems (Cerutti et al., 2017).==== Therefore, anticipating that macroprudential policy changes would be less effective in spurring the economic or financial performance anyway, the executive branch in financially more open countries may not bother to pressure the macroprudential authorities to change policy before elections. Hence, it can be expected that electoral cycles in macroprudential policy would be stronger in financially less open economies. With our second result, we document that this is indeed the case in the data.====Our third main empirical finding is that the electoral cycle in macroprudential policy – characterized by a higher probability of loosening before the election – is stronger in countries which loosened macroprudential policy fewer times in the past. This suggests that past policy actions in macroprudential policy (i.e. the total number of macroprudential loosening episodes in the country to date) play a role in generating the electoral cycle in macroprudential policy. If macroprudential policies are already loose to begin with, there may be less space to loosen them further. Indeed, as documented by Alam et al. (2019), effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth may be nonlinear, suggesting that the marginal benefit of loosening macroprudential policy may be decreasing as policy is loosened further. This might in turn influence the decision of whether to loosen or not before the election, where governments may decide to loosen policy only when the marginal benefit of loosening is high. Our third main finding is in line with this kind of phenomenon.====We also uncover the effect of macroeconomic variables on the strength of the electoral cycle in macroprudential policy. Since macroprudential policies affect macroeconomic variables such as output, credit and inflation,==== the existing levels of these macroeconomic indicators can affect the decision of whether to loosen or not before the election. For instance, if inflation is already high, e.g. due to high demand, loosening macroprudential policy to further boost aggregate demand is more likely to deteriorate inflation than to increase output. Therefore, governments may be reluctant to loosen policies when inflation is high in the first place. Our fourth main empirical finding is consistent with this hypothesis: We find that macroprudential loosening is more likely before an election, if the country is experiencing lower inflation. On the other side, we do not find much evidence on the effect of economic growth or credit on the strength of the electoral cycle in macroprudential policy.====Finally, we explore the role of other variables regarding the political environment on electoral cycles in macroprudential policy. We do not find evidence that political variables affect the electoral cycle in macroprudential policy. Particularly, the strength of the electoral cycle does not seem to depend on the system of government (parliamentary vs. presidential) or the political orientation of the governing party/executive (left, center or right).====In broad terms, our paper contributes to the long and extant literature on opportunistic political business cycles (PBCs). This literature on PBCs, which dates back to the seminal paper of Nordhaus (1975), is huge.==== Earlier studies that investigate the impact of elections on macroeconomic outcome variables such as GDP, inflation, unemployment and credit find mixed results.==== As these macroeconomic outcome variables are not within direct control of the government, literature evolved in time to look for PBCs in economic policy variables rather than these macroeconomic outcome variables.==== Among these, literature mostly focused on fiscal policy variables such as government spending and taxes,==== with some interest in monetary policy as well.====In this paper, we investigate instead the effect of elections on macroprudential policy, which is scarce as opposed to the well-studied effects on fiscal policy and monetary policy.==== In fact, we are aware of only one study thus far that investigates this issue, which is the working paper by Müller (2019). Using data from 58 countries from 2000 to 2014, he finds that macroprudential tools targeting mortgages and consumer credit are less likely to be tightened before elections, with this effect being smaller in countries with higher central bank independence. Key differences between his paper and ours are as follows: First, we have a longer time span (1990–2016 vs. 2000–2014) and a broader set of countries (80 vs. 58) including emerging market, developing and advanced economies, which allows for a higher amount of variation in institutional quality, our key focus in the empirical analysis. Second, our main result suggests that governments actively change policy (increased probability of loosening) before elections, as opposed to the emphasis on the policy inaction (reduced probability of tightening) by Müller (2019). Third, in terms of the factors affecting the strength of the electoral cycle, we are the first exploring the roles of past policy actions, capital account regime, inflation rate, system of government and the political orientation of the incumbent government.====To sum up, we contribute to the existing literature in political business cycles by using a recent and comprehensive dataset to investigate the impact of elections on a policy variable that was overlooked by almost all of the previous literature, yet is so important for the health of the financial system and the economy, namely macroprudential policy. Our findings suggest that macroprudential policy is not immune to political interference. We also contribute to the literature by identifying the institutional and other factors that affect the strength of this electoral cycle in macroprudential policy.====Several analogies exist between our empirical findings on macroprudential policy and the findings of the previous literature on electoral cycles in fiscal and monetary policies. Similar to much of the earlier empirical evidence on fiscal and monetary policies before elections (e.g. Alesina et al., 1992, Clark and Hallerberg, 2000, Kneebone and McKenzie, 2001, Gonzalez, 2002, Block, 2002, Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya, 2004, Brender and Drazen, 2005) we find that political pressure of the upcoming elections creates expansionary pre-electoral patterns in macroprudential policy. These parallel results are consistent with the idea that incumbent governments attempt to boost the economy before elections to increase their probability of reelection. Moreover, our result on the role of institutional quality in determining electoral cycles in macroprudential policy resembles the findings of Clark and Hallerberg (2000) that pre-electoral loosening in monetary policy is more likely in countries where central bank independence is low, and of Brender and Drazen (2005) that pre-electoral loosening in fiscal policy is more likely in new democracies rather than established democracies. Last but not least, our result on the role of financial openness is consistent with the idea that international pressures matter in determining the strength of electoral cycles in policy variables, as found for monetary policy by Clark and Hallerberg (2000).====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 goes over in detail what macroprudential policy is and what it does.

It is common that enrollees are eligible for greater reimbursement when they received services at selected local facilities. We investigate the impact of this portability constraint on residents' choice of job location. Using a unique, nationwide survey data set in China, we find that provision of health insurance decreases the probability of working in non-local regions for the rural residents by 2.4%. The results are mainly driven by the residence lock-in effect. That is, the insurance program discourages rural residents from working outside their registered areas of residence and, especially, in other provinces. The pullback effect, that is, the effect of the health insurance program attracting migrant workers who had worked outside back to regions close to their hometowns, is not found to be significant.","Economists and policymakers have long noted the impact of welfare programs on migration and job choice. Following the seminal work by Borjas (1999), there is one strand of the literature showing that people are more likely to move to regions with generous welfare benefits in the United States and European countries, also known as the “welfare magnet effect” (Enchautegui, 1997; McKinnish, 2007; De Giorgi and Pellizzari, 2009; Giulietti and Wahba, 2013). Another strand of the literature focused on the impact of health insurance on job mobility. Quite a few studies have shown that employer-provided health insurance reduced job mobility, namely “job lock” (Cooper and Monheit, 1993; Madrian, 1994; Buchmueller and Valletta, 1996; Stroupe et al., 2001; Gruber and Madrian, 2004). However, these studies mainly focus on issues in developed countries, while the evidence in developing countries remains limited.====In the past few decades, many developing economies, including China, have experienced both a large wave of rural-to-urban migration and the expansion of health insurance. The rural-to-urban migrant working becomes one of the major factors contributing to the economic development, while it also leads to loss of working-age population and downfall of the rural regions (Whalley and Zhang, 2007; Lucas, 2016; Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2016). There are 285.6 million migrant workers in China in 2020 (National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China, 2021). It becomes common that mostly just the elderly and children are left in the rural regions, with the majority of the working-age population migrated to the urban areas, leading to further urban-rural inequality and tension in society (Zhu and Luo, 2010; Howell, 2017; Chen et al., 2018). Providing welfare programs in the rural areas, including public-subsidized health insurance, is a way to reduce inequality. Therefore, scrutinizing its impact on the labor supply decisions of rural residents in the developing country is policy-relevant in terms of increasing equality and fulfilling the long-term development goals of these regions.====This study fills the gap by exploring the impact of the major social health insurance program in rural China, namely, the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), on rural residents' choice of job location.==== On the one hand, this insurance program has a tiered network and is designed to encourage the population to receive healthcare services at local medical facilities; therefore, rural workers may be “locked” at local areas by the portability constraint, weakening their motivation to search for jobs in other regions. On the other hand, getting access to health insurance may improve the health status of the insured, enabling healthier workers to migrate for higher labor income. The extent of the program's impacts on labor supply and how they are channeled calls for rigorous empirical analysis.====Using a unique, nationwide representative sample, we first investigate the overall impact of NRCMS on rural residents and then explore the heterogeneous impacts across different groups. The results suggest that the provision of NRCMS has discouraged rural residents from working outside their residence area. Participation in NRCMS decreases the probability of working outside the village of residence by 2.4%.====We further explore the channels of the impacts. The behavioral change of working outside the village of residence could be induced by two mechanisms, namely the resident lock-in effect and the pullback effect. The former refers to the effect of the program discouraging rural workers from moving to other regions for work. The latter refers to the effect of the program attracting rural residents who had worked outside back to regions close to their hometowns. According to our analyses, no statistically significant results are found for the pullback effect. The overall effect is mainly driven by the residence lock-in effect, which shows that the probability of working outside the village of residence decreases by 3.8%. These findings support the assumption that the limited portability of health insurance benefits discourages rural residents from working far from their villages of residence.====We also explore other possible channels that health insurance affects job location, including (i) the health improvement effect, i.e., NRCMS improves health status, leading to more labor supply and higher probability of working outside one's residence area; (ii) income effect, i.e., NRCMS may reduce out-of-pocket medical expenditures and increase non-medical consumptions; and (iii) risk attitude effect, i.e., NRCMS lowers the degree of risk-averse and might increase the likelihood of working outside. We run various analyses to test the above channels but none of them yield significant results as regards NRCMS enrollment, therefore, it is unlikely that those could perform as valid channels to further impact the job choice.====Our work contributes to the literature on two aspects. First, the study provides new evidence on the impact of health insurance on job location in a developing country. It has been widely discussed that the main determinants for people's choices of work locations include housing price, wage, and ease of commute (So et al., 2001; Moss et al., 2004; Timmins, 2006; Ebertz, 2009). Only a few studies examine the impact of health insurance on job mobility in developed countries (Gruber, 2000; Cutler 2002; Gruber and Madrian, 2004). Our work contributes by showing how insurance, especially the portability of health insurance, also affects residents' work location choices in developing countries.====Second, the study is among the first to scrutinize and evaluate the impact of NRCMS on migration. The existing studies looking into NRCMS in China focus on its direct impacts on health care utilization and cost, as well as indirect impacts on consumption and saving (Qiu et al., 2011; Qin et al., 2014; Bai and Wu, 2014; Cheung and Padieu, 2015). Here we provide new evidence on another important aspect of the indirect impact, namely, how NRCMS changes the job location choices of residents in rural China, and we further separated and discussed the mechanism of pullback effect and residence lock-in effect. The most relevant studies are conducted by Qin and Zheng (2012), and Jiang et al. (2012). Our analysis differs from their work on three aspects. First, in terms of residence lock-in effect, we focus on the sample of residents who were not migrant working right before the implementation of NRCMS and explore how insurance affects their decisions on the job location. This effect is not explicitly investigated in the previous studies. Second, in terms of the pullback effect, we control for individual fixed effects using panel data to better address the endogeneity concern. Third, we conduct a variety of heterogeneity analyses and mechanism investigations to enhance the understanding of migration behavior.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

For the period from 2009 to 2013, we combine firm-level data covering more than 40,000 firms from the Vietnam Enterprise Survey with province-level data from the Vietnam Provincial Competitiveness Indicators. Our estimation strategy builds upon a novel copula-based estimator that accounts for potential endogeneity biases without requiring external instruments. Our results show that financial development and a favourable business environment generally promote firm growth, but some components of the business environment, such as low entry costs, access to land and business service support, foster firm growth more strongly than financial development. Most importantly, financial development and the business environment interact positively in their effects on firm growth. The impact of local financial development on firm growth is higher in provinces with a competitive business environment. Conversely, improvements in provincial competitiveness have a greater impact on firm growth in provinces with a more developed financial sector. The results clearly show that policies to promote local financial development need to be coordinated with measures to improve the broader business environment.","Micro and small enterprises (MSEs) are widely regarded as an important contributor to job creation and a significant source of revenue in many developing and emerging economies. They also account for a sizeable share of aggregate economic output and play a vital role in poverty reduction (Mead and Liedholm, 1998, Beck and Demirguc-Kunt, 2006, Coad and Tamvada, 2012, Mano et al., 2012). Yet, despite the existence of a narrow class of high performing firms, the vast majority of these firms never grow beyond a few employees (Mead and Liedholm, 1998, Coad and Tamvada, 2012, Nichter and Goldmark, 2009). Against this background, considerable empirical efforts have been made over the past two decades to investigate the factors behind this poor performance of MSEs. Besides individual entrepreneurial and firm-specific characteristics, the literature has so far identified several aspects of the business environment as determinants of firm growth in these economies.====Among the various aspects of the business environment, a developed financial sector has been consistently singled out in the literature as a crucial determinant of firm growth in developing countries (e.g., Ayyagari et al., 2008, Beck and Demirguc-Kunt, 2006, Aterido et al., 2011, Clarke et al., 2012). Indeed, earlier studies, such as [12], treat access to finance not just as an aspect of the business environment, but as a distinct, and often more important, determinant of firm growth than the business environment. A number of studies have also highlighted the role that other aspects of the business environment, such as low corruption, secure property rights, adequate infrastructure, bureaucratic quality and effective contract enforcement, play in facilitating firm growth (e.g., Brown et al., 2005, Ayyagari et al., 2008, Reyes et al., 2017). However, while there have been a few attempts to quantify the relative significance for firm growth of the various aspects of the business environment (e.g., Ayyagari et al., 2008), the literature on their complementarity is surprisingly scant. More generally, little is known about how far the overall business environment should be developed for individual factors to induce significant impact on firm performance.====In this paper, we concentrate on firms’ access to finance and seek to answer the following questions: Is local financial development more beneficial to firm growth when the overall business environment is favourable or, on the contrary, is finance even more important in a poor business environment, because it may help firms offset the negative repercussions of other (poor or missing) components of the business environment? For our empirical analysis, we focus on Vietnam, not least because of the availability of a rich nationally representative firm-level survey and novel province-level data on economic governance. Vietnam also offers an ideal setup to study the complementarity between financial sector development and the broader business environment, as it is home to a large number of vibrant MSEs, whose performance has often been significantly constrained by an unfavourable business environment, including widespread corruption, various bureaucratic bottlenecks, and financial constraints (e.g., Malesky et al., 2019).====Our main data for the empirical analysis come from the Vietnam Enterprise Survey (VES) and cover more than 40,000 firms for the period 2009–2013. Local financial development and the business environment are measured at the province level. To describe the business environment in its full dimensionality, we rely on data collected for the Vietnam Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI). Launched in 2005, the PCI has summarized survey-based information from a total of ten sub-indices that quantify how aspects of economic governance in Vietnam (e.g. low entry-costs, access to land, business support services) impact on the development of the private sector.====As an empirical strategy, we augment related empirical models of firm growth with an eight-dimensional space of business environment characteristics and also allow for the likely important interactions with established growth factors such as financial development. When it comes to model augmentation with potential interaction effects, however, an overly flexible empirical strategy might come at the cost of violating important principles of model parsimony. Prior to formalizing interaction patterns for our eight-dimensional space of business environment characteristics, we therefore apply principal component techniques to summarize the available sample information on the business environment in terms of (two) principal components. The focus on principal components interacting with financial development conveniently resolves the trade-off between model flexibility and parsimony, in particular, in light of the fact that empirical models such as ours have to cope with potential endogeneity biases. Our modelling strategy therefore allows us to examine complementarities between financial development and a rich variety of features of the business environment, such as corruption, access to land, business support services and legal institutions, in affecting firm growth.====The use of single equation (panel) models to condition firm growth on stylized features of the business environment in general, and financial development and corruption in particular, is likely to entail risks of endogeneity biases. Such biases could arise from various sources, such as reverse causality or unspecified correlation between covariate information and model residuals. Given the plethora of potentially endogenous right hand side variables in our empirical model, we consider the search for sufficient and independent instrumental variable information as infeasible. Instead, we employ the copula-based identification strategy of Park and Gupta (2012) as an empirical strategy to robustly identify the causal impacts of financial development and various dimensions of the business environment on firm growth.====Our results show that local financial development—measured by the number of financial suppliers per capita—and the business environment interact positively in their effects on firm growth in terms of sales per worker, sales and investment. In particular, the impact of local financial development on firm growth is stronger in provinces with a competitive business environment. Conversely, improvements in provincial competitiveness exert stronger effects on firm growth in provinces with a more developed financial sector. Subject to certain qualifications, our results are in general robust to controlling for the interaction between financial development and corruption, as well as to using the volume of private credit relative to total output or the number of financial suppliers per square kilometre as alternative indicators of local financial development. Our results, which are based on a novel identification strategy, also confirm earlier evidence that province-level financial development significantly promotes firm growth. Moreover, a competitive business environment affects firm growth positively. In terms of effect magnitude, certain characteristics of the business environment, in particular low entry cost, access to land, and business support services, impact on firm growth more strongly than does local financial development.====Our contribution to the empirical literature on the determinants of firm growth is three-fold. First, our paper adds to the debate on the (joint) effects of financial development and the business environment by putting the latter into a broad perspective that allows for simultaneous interactions of financial development with several distinct and heterogeneous facets of the business environment such as corruption, entry costs and bureaucratic quality.==== Second, while a vast literature examines potential determinants of firm growth, it generally suffers from endogeneity concerns as the growth of firms often also affects the growth factor under consideration. By addressing endogeneity concerns with a novel identification strategy that does not require the use of instrumental variables, we are able to document results that bolster our confidence in the existing evidence on the generally positive effects of financial development and the business environment on firm performance. Third, since firm growth is one of the most important and reliable indicators of firm performance, the literature on the determinants of MSE performance largely relies on the use of firm growth as the sole indicator of firm performance (e.g., Beck et al., 2005, Ayyagari et al., 2008). In this regard, our use of three different measures of firm growth (sales growth, productivity growth, and investment growth) allows us to view our results as evidence of the important role that local financial development and the business environment play not only in firm growth, but also in the overall performance of MSEs in Vietnam.====In Section 2, we discuss potential channels through which financial development and the business environment could interact in affecting the growth of firms. We document summary statistics of the data and describe the estimation methodology in Sections 3 Data, 4 Identification strategy , respectively. In Section 5, we provide detailed discussions of empirical results. Section 6 concludes.

Instability seems, in particular, to lead to a reshuffling from investment expenditures to increased food consumption, implying lower growth prospects in the future. With respect to economic growth, the sizable education and health effects seem to be particularly worrisome.","Political instability and latent social conflict are widespread in many low- and middle-income countries. Households are exposed to economic uncertainty, endemic violence, civil protests, military coups, and terrorism. The last decade has seen an increase of such incidents engendering political instability in many countries (SIPRI, 2016; 2017). For instance, the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt, the ten-year long political crisis in Côte d'Ivoire, the military coup and terrorism in Mali, and the 2014 popular insurrection and terrorism in Burkina Faso are all cases of political turmoil that occasioned many deaths and affected the living conditions of households even if they did not lead to a lasting civil war.====There is a large and still growing literature that shows that political instability and social conflict are associated with poor economic outcomes including lower investment and reduced economic growth (see e.g. Acemoglu and Robinson, 2001; Ades and Chua, 1997; Aisen and Veiga, 2013; Alesina and Perotti, 1996; Alesina et al., 1996; Campos and Nugent, 2002; Fang et al., 2020; Gupta, 1990; Gyimah-Brempong and Traynor, 1999; Jong-A-Pin, 2009; Rodrik, 1991, Rodrik, 1999; Roe and Siegel, 2011; Stewart and Venieris, 1985; Svensson, 1998; Venieris and Gupta, 1986). Most of this literature focuses on cross-country data. There is also some emerging research on firms (Chong and Gradstein, 2009), but there is very little research on households’ saving and investment behavior; notable exceptions are Aaberge et al. (2017), Giesing and Musić (2019) and González and Lopez, (2007). Dupas and Robinson (2010; 2012) focus on the incomes, expenditures and consumption of small-scale business owners, shopkeepers and women who supply transactional sex exposed to the 2007/2008 post-election violence in Kenya. Yet, most of the literature on households tends to focus on the consequences of interstate and civil wars (see e.g. Akresh et al., 2011; 2012; Brück et al., 2019; Calvo et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2016; Justino and Verwimp, 2013; León, 2012; Mercier et al., 2020) and not on instability and latent social conflict.====We address this gap and analyze, following some of the macroeconomic literature, the effects of political instability and latent social conflict on households’ saving and investment behavior. We do this for the case of Burkina Faso, a very poor country that has increasingly experienced political instability stemming from both internal and external sources, and that is quite typical for many countries in the Sub-Saharan African region. We predict that political instability creates economic shocks household must cope with and that therefore the reallocate their resources towards assets that are easy to divest and to divide. For our empirical analysis, we merge six rounds of household survey data with a geo-referenced time series of politically motivated events and fatalities from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Base (ACLED). We analyze households’ decisions relative to asset and investment portfolios, i.e. financial savings, investments in durable goods, housing improvements and livestock, and investments in human capital, especially health and education. For identification, we exploit variation in the intensity of political instability across time and space while controlling for time- and municipality-fixed effects, rainfall and nighttime light intensity, and many other potential confounders. We complement this by tests for selection on unobservables.====We find a negative association of political instability and financial savings, the accumulation of durables, investment in house improvements, and investment in education and health. Instability seems in particular to lead to a reshuffling from investment expenditures to increased food consumption. Overall, the pattern found in the data suggests that the exposure to instability comes with higher income risks in agricultural and non-agricultural activities that force households to engage in consumption smoothing. Our results are robust to a whole range of checks, yet a few concerns remain. Despite municipality- and time-fixed effects and many controls, we cannot fully rule out a potential bias due to reverse causality. Moreover, given the absence of detailed migration data, we can also not adequately address a potential bias due to selective migration.====The findings of this paper add to the extensive, rather macroeconomic, literature cited above by highlighting an important channel of how political instability impairs economic growth. This channel might be hidden in much of the cross-country panel data analyses that is the basis of this literature and focuses typically on corporate and public investment. Increased household consumption at the cost of reduced accumulation reduces the growth prospects of an economy. Lower investment in human capital in particular will come with high long-term costs and slow down the progress of achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and hold back structural change. Our study also complements the more microeconomic literature on the consequences of conflict and war, also cited above, as it shows that even the risk of conflict and war, and not just the actual occurrence, affects households’ savings and investment decisions. Finally, this paper adds to the literature on shocks and risk-coping in developing countries (see e.g. Dercon, 2004a; Fafchamps, 2003; Townsend, 1994). This literature has largely focused on the short-run implications, whereas our paper emphasizes the longer-term implications for growth and development. The literature has also limited itself to the analysis of weather and health shocks, but not sufficiently to the risks related to poorly functioning political institutions, which are probably even more important in at least some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (Dercon, 2008).====The roadmap of the paper is as follows.

We collaborated with the main Islamic authority in Mozambique, which sponsored two randomized interventions to prevent violence related to youth radicalization: a religious campaign against extremist views of Islam, targeting change in beliefs; and a training module on entrepreneurship and employment, aiming to increase the opportunity cost of conflict. Our measurement focuses on anti-social behavior in a Joy-of-destruction lab game. We find that only the religious treatment decreased the propensity to destroy the payoffs of others. Consistently, surveys show increased trust in the state and decreased support for extremism. We conclude that religious sensitization is likely to be cost-effective in preventing Islamic radicalization and anti-social behavior.","Islamic societies have long been associated with lower economic development (Kuran, 1997). Still, recent studies have found a complex picture, often emphasizing the role of institutions (Kuran, 2004) and of politics (Platteau, 2008, Platteau, 2011) in mediating negative economic consequences.==== At the same time, political Islam and Islamist political movements associated with Islamic radicalization are a likely product of particular internal conditions such as the presence of an educated middle class and minimal infrastructure (Brooke and Ketchley, 2018). Binzel and Carvalho (2017) as well as Fourati (2018) underline the role of inequality and decreased social mobility in recent Islamic revivals.==== These revivals are often linked to social tensions and violence. Social tensions within Muslim communities include the withdrawal from mainstream society into subgroups with specific rituals and symbols, as well as social norms. Often these norms entail extreme levels of gender segregation as well as the shutdown of commerce. We devote our attention in this paper to ways of avoiding the (broadly-construed) violent implications of Islamic radicalization.====Indeed, in recent years, most of the major violent conflicts in the world have happened in Muslim-majority countries. Of these conflicts, a substantial and increasing share has been related to Islamist insurgents.==== We can thus safely assert that Islamic radicalization is one of the main correlates of violent conflict in the world today. Although the world awoke to Islamic radicalization with the 9/11 Al-Qaeda attacks in the US and the subsequent war in Afghanistan, this phenomenon has become clear in many different Muslim-majority countries. These include Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has been particularly active, Nigeria, where Boko Haram was initiated, and Somalia, home of Al-Shaabab, as well as many other countries across the Middle East and the Caucasus, North and Central Africa, and South Asia, where ramifications of Islamist groups have become prominent.====Conflict prevention in the context of Islamic radicalization is thus a complex problem that requires attention. Different potential solutions have been tried. The obvious one is military, i.e., targeting terrorist organizations and specific (potential) aggressors within these. However, as it became clear from the very beginning of the Afghanistan war in 2001, the repression of terrorists cannot be enacted alone due to the risk of losing widespread local support.==== Consistently, the US has focused on winning the ‘hearts and minds’ of the local populations in Afghanistan and Iraq through development interventions. This type of strategy became a focal point of practitioners since the work of Collier and Hoeffler (2004) and of Miguel et al. (2004), which both emphasize the idea that increasing the opportunity cost of engaging in conflict is a way to prevent it.====However, the counterinsurgency strategy based on material benefits sidelines the specificity of religious motivations behind Islamist violence. Radicalized Muslims have strong religious beliefs that may trump any material payoff. An alternative is to work with regular, non-extremist Muslims to prevent the spread of radical Islam. The setting of our study, the province of Cabo Delgado in Northern Mozambique, faced the emergence of conflict linked to Islamic radicalization==== shortly after the local discovery of substantial natural resources. In 2010, there was a large discovery of natural gas in Cabo Delgado, with the potential to turn the country into one of the largest exporters of liquefied natural gas in the world (World Bank, 2014). Although production will not begin until the mid-2020s, foreign investment has already started, with major extractive multinationals embarking on the construction of refinery plants and other logistics investments. These investments stand in contrast with the nature of Cabo Delgado province: a remote and primarily rural area of the country, home to a majority Muslim population, with high poverty and child mortality rates compared to national standards.====It is in this context that several attacks have been reported in the province of Cabo Delgado, starting at the end of 2017. Although doubts persist about the motivation for these attacks, some facts are undisputed. First, although the attacks were initially made against state institutions like the police, they rapidly became widespread in rural areas, targeting civilians on roads or the destruction of entire villages, as well as foreign convoys linked to the natural gas operations. Since then, we can account for more than 2500 people killed, many of whom were decapitated. Second, there are many associations of these episodes with radicalized Muslims.==== There are many reports of infiltration of local mosques by individuals with links to the Al-Shabaab movement. Although the police were able to identify some foreigners connected to the violence, there is no doubt that most perpetrators of violence are Mozambican.==== Still, longstanding Muslim authorities in the region have a tradition of peaceful positions, namely in the mediation of conflict-prone Mozambican politics. This is a setting where religious sensitization by Muslim authorities against a radical version of Islam makes particular sense as a way to prevent further violence.====In this paper, we report on the results of a randomized field experiment we conducted in the capital of Cabo Delgado. We collaborated with the main Muslim authority in Mozambique, which sponsored two conflict-prevention interventions, targeting young men from local mosques. The first intervention was a religious sensitization campaign conducted by religious leaders, who provided information about the lack of theological foundation of a number of typical claims by Islamic fundamentalists. Some of these claims had a direct connection to violent behavior. The main motivation of this campaign was to change the religious beliefs of subjects, directing them toward non-extremist Islam. The second intervention was a training module on entrepreneurship and employment in the local labor market. It made specific reference to the new jobs expected in the region connected to the extraction of natural resources. The main idea of this module was to improve the economic prospects of subjects, i.e., as a way to increase the opportunity cost of engaging in conflict. Hence, we study two main conflict-prevention strategies: one, less standard, aiming to change religious beliefs and informed by the literature on political Islam; the other, more standard in both policy and research, informed by the literature on Islam and development, which aims to change the economic prospects of potential perpetrators of violence.====In addition to studying conflict-prevention through changes in religious beliefs, we innovate through the measurement of outcomes: we focus our attention on measuring anti-social behavior by employing a Joy-of-destruction lab game (Abbink and Herrmann, 2011, Abbink and Sadrieh, 2009). To the best of our knowledge, only Scacco and Warren (2018) have employed a version of this game in conflict-prone Nigeria to assess the impact of a conflict-prevention intervention. Specifically, they studied an intervention aimed at increasing social contact between Christian and Muslim young men. Generally, we know that behavior in the Joy-of-destruction game is associated with known determinants of conflict: Caldara et al. (2017) show that anti-social behavior in the game is associated with triggers of conflict, i.e., fear, monetary incentives, and uncertainty about an opponent's desire to cause harm; Prediger et al. (2014) show a correlation between anti-social behavior in the game and long-run resource scarcity among pastoralists in Namibia.==== The Joy-of-destruction game is played in pairs. Each subject has a unique decision to make, i.e., whether to destroy the endowment of the other player at a cost. Subjects play simultaneously. In our implementation of the lab game, the main Muslim sample we follow plays against four types of opponents: local Muslims, local Christians, local public officials, and foreigners. We measure beliefs about the behavior of counterparts as well. In our study, we are able to track 1520 experimental decisions about destruction in the Joy-of-destruction game. We complement our behavioral measurements with standard survey-based attitudes, namely on measuring extreme religious views that may lead to violence.====Our results show that the religious sensitization reduced anti-social behavior in the Joy-of-destruction game: the magnitude of the effect is 8–9 percentage points on the probability that subjects in our main Muslim sample destroy the payoffs of their opponents. Differently, we observe no effects of the training module related to entrepreneurship and employment, which aimed to raise opportunity costs of violent behavior, on the same outcome. In fact, this intervention significantly increases the belief that others will behave in an anti-social manner in the Joy-of-destruction game. We interpret this finding in light of the resource discovery in the region, which was explicitly mentioned during the training. Theory and evidence on the resource curse emphasize an increase in rent-seeking (Baland and Francois, 2000; Tornell and Lane, 1999; Torvik, 2002) and a deterioration of political behavior (Armand et al., 2020; Brollo et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2006; Vicente, 2010) following the discovery of natural resources. We also report on suggestive evidence that our main Muslim sample targets more anti-social behavior towards public officials and foreigners, consistent with the violent attacks that have taken place in the region. Finally, we observe effects of the religious campaign on survey attitudes, namely on increased optimism regarding peace in the region, increased trust in the state, and lower support for mixing religion with politics. These findings underline the importance of religious sensitization by Islamic authorities to reduce radicalization and the politization of Islam.====This paper contributes to four additional strands of literature. First, the vast literature on civil wars and the mechanisms behind the emergence of conflict (Berman et al., 2017; Blattman and Annan, 2016; Blattman and Miguel, 2010; Dube and Vargas, 2013). Second, the recent literature on US counterinsurgency strategies based on aid programs that target the livelihoods of the local communities (Beath et al., 2017; Berman et al., 2011a; Crost et al., 2014; Hirose et al., 2017; Lyall et al., 2020). Third, going beyond conflict prevention based on material benefits, we contribute to the literature emphasizing the importance of the attitudes of potential insurgents (Abadie, 2006; Atran 2003; Berman et al., 2011b; Bursztyn et al., 2020; Dell and Querubin, 2018; Krueger and Malečková, 2003; Lyall, 2010; Lyall et al., 2013). Finally, we add to the literature on community-driven reconstruction, which emphasizes that promoting collective action and social cohesion can be an enduring conflict-prevention strategy (Collier and Vicente, 2014; Fafchamps and Vicente, 2013; Fearon et al., 2009, 2015).",Preventing Islamic radicalization: Experimental evidence on anti-social behavior,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759672100072X,1 December 2021,2021,Research Article,78.0

The V-Dem indicator is coded for almost all contemporary and historical polities since the year 1900 and, for some countries, since the French Revolution. This global dataset allows us to exploit long-run, slow-moving variation within countries for identification, circumventing many of the difficulties faced by previous studies based on cross-section data or short panels. We present robust evidence of a negative effect of corruption on steady-state growth. Yet, we find that corruption interacts with political regime type, giving rise to heterogeneous effects. In particular, corruption is found to be significantly more deleterious for growth in democracies than in autocracies. Since corruption tends to be decentralised in democracies and centralised in autocracies, these findings are in line with theories of the ‘industrial organisation’ of corruption. We find little to no evidence that institutional weaknesses along other dimensions (state capacity, regulatory quality, property rights protection) make corruption any less harmful for growth, casting doubt on the thesis that corruption may ‘grease the wheels’ of dysfunctional institutions. Our findings provide a rationale to target anti-corruption efforts to young democracies.","Since the early 1990s, corruption – the abuse of public office for private or sectional gain – has been regarded as one of the main obstacles to economic growth and development. Accordingly, national governments and international agencies have devoted an increasing share of their budgets to fighting graft, both at home and abroad (Marquette, 2003). But does corruption actually harm economic performance? If so, under what circumstances is corruption most harmful? Can corruption ever be compatible with (or even conducive to) economic dynamism?====The available evidence is suggestive of a negative effect of corruption on economic growth (see Ugur, 2013 for a meta-analysis). Yet, existing analyses are based primarily on cross-country regressions. Meanwhile, the few recent studies based on panel data rely on a very limited amount of over-time variation for identification. Due to these data limitations, all existing empirical studies face a number of critical threats to causal inference, leading Aidt (2009: 288) to conclude that ‘the search for a negative effect of corruption on the average growth rate of GDP per capita has failed to produce convincing and robust evidence’.====Here, we analyse a newly assembled indicator of corruption from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset (Coppedge et al., 2020a). This data provides reliable, expert-coded information on the prevalence of corruption at the country-year level, covering almost all contemporary and historical polities since the year 1900 and, for some countries, since the French Revolution (1789). As such, V-Dem offers by far the most comprehensive data source on corruption available to date, improving dramatically upon all existing indicators, including Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (1997–2019) and the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) index (1982–2019). Although now at its 10th edition, the V-Dem indicator of corruption has not been used to shed light on the relationship between corruption and economic growth. By combining V-Dem data with long-run historical information on GDP and population from Fariss et al. (2017), this paper fills this gap, overcoming the severe data limitation problems that plagued previous studies.====The identification of the causal impact of corruption on economic growth faces a number of critical challenges, which we address in the present study. ====, cross-sectional regression estimates, as those in Mauro (1995), Mo (2001) and Pellegrini and Gerlagh (2004), are likely biased by the omission of country-level unobservables. Cultural characteristics and historical legacies, which are idiosyncratic and difficult to measure, may exert a joint influence on corruption and economic performance. A related problem is that the earliest indicators of corruption were coded in the mid-1980s, which means that corruption is typically measured in the middle or even at the end of the growth period examined (typically, 1970–2000). Thus, cross-sectional estimates are only valid under the assumption that the relative prevalence of corruption across countries is stable over time. While plausible in the very short run, this assumption becomes much stronger when growth periods of 20–30 years are considered. Here, we address these two problems by using panel-data estimates with country fixed effects.==== existing panel-data estimates, such as those in D'Agostino et al. (2016a) and Cieślik and Goczek (2018), assume that corruption indicators track the ‘true’ level of corruption precisely enough to permit a meaningful identification of causal effects from short-run variation. Unfortunately, the nature of existing corruption indices complicates ‘any meaningful analysis of their variation over time, at least until longer time series are available’ (Méon and Sekkat, 2005: 80). For one thing, existing indices are prone to small ‘jumps’ resulting from random measurement error (Treisman, 2007; Standaert, 2015). For another, the structural trend around which they fluctuate is subject to strong inertia, leading to low variation over time. To circumvent these problems, we turn to the unprecedented time coverage provided by the V-Dem dataset, exploiting long-run, slow-moving variation in corruption levels within countries for identification. This variation is unlikely to result primarily from white noise, mitigating concerns of attenuation bias and increasing the precision of standard estimators.====, the ‘dynamics of the relationship between corruption, governance, and economic performance […] are not yet fully understood’ (Méon and Weill, 2010: 254). For one thing, the true effects of corruption on economic performance may be confounded by other features of the institutional environment that are associated with corruption. For another, the institutional environment may exacerbate or attenuate the economic consequences of corruption, giving rise to interaction effects. To make progress on these fronts, we first condition our fixed-effects estimates on four time-varying measures of institutional quality – state capacity, regulatory quality, property rights protection and the quality of democracy. Next, we add multiplicative terms to explore in a panel-date framework how corruption interacts with these characteristics. In contrast to previous studies, which typically focus on one or two institutional dimensions as potential effect-modifiers, we examine several possible interactions in a systematic framework.==== our analysis tackles other potential threats to identification. For starters, we control for a number of observable determinants of economic growth that vary over time. Since the ‘true’ effect of corruption may be confounded by the influence of time-varying unobservables, we present alternative specifications in which we model explicitly the dynamic adjustment of GDP, as in recent work by Acemoglu et al. (2020). In robustness tests, we employ two strategies to further mitigate concerns of simultaneity and omitted variable bias. First, we use instrumental variables to isolate an exogenous component of variation in the level of corruption over time. Second, we consider estimates that net out the influence of country- and region-specific time trends.====We find robust evidence of a negative causal impact of corruption on economic growth. This effect holds on average and, being identified from long-run time-series variation, it can be interpreted as an equilibrium effect. Yet, we find that its absolute magnitude varies substantially depending on the quality of democratic institutions. Across a variety of model specifications, corruption is significantly less detrimental for economic performance in more autocratic regimes. An explanation for this finding, for which we find suggestive evidence in the data, is that the type of corruption that typically prevails in autocracies (centralised corruption) is less harmful for growth than the form of (decentralised) corruption that is commonly found in democracies (Shleifer and Vishny, 1993; Ehrlich and Lui, 1999).====We find little to no evidence that other features of the institutional environment – state capacity, regulatory quality, property rights protection – exert a moderating influence on the corruption-growth relationship. This finding runs counter to the so-called ‘grease the wheels’ hypothesis, which claims that corruption may help firms and households circumvent pre-existing institutional dysfunctions, thereby promoting (or at least not harming) economic performance in environments with weak institutions.====These findings contribute to a large empirical literature on corruption and growth, which is reviewed systematically in Appendix A. Virtually all the studies reviewed share the limitations identified earlier, and the validity of their results is questionable. The closest paper to ours is Gründler and Potrafke (2019), which examines the ‘grease the wheels’ hypothesis in a panel-data framework. Yet, their data cover as few as seven years, and they use ==== of real GDP per capita to populate the most recent years of the dataset (2019: 4n).====The paper proceeds as follows. To guide the empirical analysis, we first present a theoretical framework. We then discuss our data, focusing specifically on the V-Dem index of Political Corruption (Section 3). After examining the ‘average’ effect of corruption on economic growth (Section 4), we explore whether these effects are heterogeneous across different institutional environments (Section 5). In Section 6, we investigate the mechanisms and present additional results. Section 7 concludes.","Corruption and growth: Historical evidence, 1790–2010",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596721000640,2 November 2021,2021,Research Article,79.0

This paper analyses the role of sorting between and bargaining within firms for gender wage gap using the methodology of Card, Cardoso and Kline (2016) and employing linked employer-employee data from Estonia, a country with the highest gender wage gap in EU. We find that firm-level factors explain 40% of the gender wage gap and that the within-firm bargaining plays important role. This latter effect can reflect institutions like low minimum wages and union power. The role of firm-level factors has increased over time and is especially important at the top of the wage distribution and amongst workers that are more skilled. We also find, in contrast to some recent evidence from other countries, that parenthood is not activating the effects of firm-level wage premiums on the gender wage gap. This is likely related to work-family institutions in our sample country, such as job protection of mothers after childbirth and generous availability of formal childcare. The results point to the importance of institutions in the manifestation of firm level factors in the gender wage gap.","The gender convergence in employment and education in developed economies in later part of the 20th century has largely exhausted the explanatory power of the conventional key factors of the gender wage gap such as differences in human capital (Blau and Kahn 2017; Gallen et al., 2019). This is especially the case at the top of the wage distribution (Fortin et al., 2017). Together with institutional variables (Bruns 2019; Bargain et al., 2019), the firm-level factors (Card et al., 2016) have been raised as a promising avenue for understanding the remaining gender wage gap.====This study investigates the role of firm-level wage premiums in the gender wage gap using linked employer-employee data from Estonia. We disentangle the role of the sorting of employees into high-wage or high-productivity firms (the sorting channel) and the within-firm gender wage gap (the bargaining channel) using the decomposition methodology of Card et al. (2016). We ask two questions. First, whether the role of firm-level wage premiums varies in respect to the distribution of wages, the level of education or occupation categories. We seek to understand whether the firm-specific wage premiums can explain the increasing gender wage gap at the top of the wage distribution. Second, we investigate whether the child penalty in wages materialises through firm-level wage premiums. We study whether the motherhood penalty in wages comes from women sorting to lower-wage firms or earning lower wages within the same firms after childbirth. Lastly, we put these results to the context of labour-market institutions.====The paper estimates gendered wage regressions of the type proposed by Abowd et al. (1999) with individual and firm fixed effects. The methodology of Card et al. (2016) is used to normalise firm fixed effects using labour productivity and the role of firms in the gender wage gap is derived as gender differences in firm fixed effects. The sorting and bargaining effect is disentangled using decomposition where firm effects perform as coefficients in standard Oaxaca-Blinder type of decomposition. We use the whole population-based panel of linked employer-employee data from 2006 to 2018. This is a significant value of our paper, as papers so far have had to exclude a substantial share of firms due to imperfect matching of employee and employer level data or to impute a substantial part of trimmed employee level data (see e.g. Card et al., 2016, Card et al., 2013). Our data are less prone to limited mobility bias, which can originate from small subsamples of the population (Card et al., 2018).====Our analysis is based on data from Estonia, which is an excellent case to study the drivers of the gender wage gap. It has the largest unconditional and conditional gender wage gap in the European Union (EU) and the 2nd highest in the OECD, and stands out with a high share of the gap unexplained, two-thirds of the gap remains unexplained by the standard often-used determinants (see e.g. Christofides et al., 2013, Anspal 2015). There is high wage inequality and labour market institutions are characterised by low minimum wages, low union density and low collective bargaining coverage, while work-family institutions are the most generous amongst the OECD countries. It has been shown that lenient labour market institutions enlarge the gender wage gap (Bruns 2019; Bargain et al., 2019), while the generous work-family policies have double-edged sword effect, availability of formal child-care reduces the gap and generous maternity leave enlarges the gap (Christofides et al., 2013). We aim to relate the effect of these institutions to the role of firms in the gender wage gap.====Our findings suggest a larger gender wage gap in high-performance firms. The firm-level wage premiums explain 40% of the gender gap in wages, of which from half to two thirds originate from men sorting to high-performance high-wage firms and the remaining from women bargaining lower premiums within a firm. The large role of within-firm bargaining in the gender wage gap can be related to institutions such as low minimum wages and low union power. The role of firm-level wage premiums has been increasing over time and it is much more important for the top wage earners and for high-skilled white collars. Our findings support the idea that segregation between firms (Cardoso et al., 2016) and increase in the productivity dispersion of firms==== (Bruns 2019) are behind the persistently high gender wage gap amongst top earners.====However, we do not find that parenthood is activating the effects of firm-level wage premiums on the gender wage gap. This is significantly different from the findings of Coudin et al. (2018) using French data and Bruns (2019) using German data. Our results point to potential importance of labour market and family-work policies in the realisation of firm-level factors in the gender wage gap. The strict protection of jobs of mothers and availability of formal childcare mitigate the materialisation of firm-level factors directly in periods after childbirth.====The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we contribute to recent literature on the role of firm-level factors in the gender wage gap, disentangling the role of sorting and bargaining in an institutional environment characterised by low unionisation, relatively low minimum wages and very high wage inequality and gender wage gap (see e.g. Masso et al., 2018). There are only a few papers that have applied this approach (Card et al., 2016; Coudin et al., 2018; Bruns 2019; Casarico and Lattenzio 2019; et al., 2020), and highlight the importance of the institutional environment in the findings. For example, Card et al. (2016) and Casarico and Lattenzio (2019), using Portuguese and Italian data, show that the role of bargaining accounts for one-third of the effect of firm-level wage premiums on the gender wage gap and et al., 2020 that bargaining accounts for even half of it in Canada, while Coudin et al. (2018) and Bruns (2019), using French and German data, find that bargaining plays almost no role. Coudin et al. (2018) and Bruns (2019) link their findings to very high minimum wages in France and the strong role of unions and collective bargaining in Germany. Minimum wages and unions affect the lower part of the wage distribution, contributing to the gender wage gap within firms in the lower part of the wage distribution.====Some studies have applied the approach from Card et al. (2016) without disentangling the bargaining effect and just test the role of sorting between firms in the gender wage gap (Sorkin 2017 for the US, Jewell et al., 2019 for UK, Gallen et al., 2019 for Denmark). The limitation of these studies has been that they cannot link their firm-level fixed effects to firm-level data on productivity. This does not allow them to normalise the firm fixed effects. Finally, there are studies that analyse the role of the employer simply by controlling for the mean establishment earnings (Goldin et al., 2017). All these studies conclude that firm-level factors and sorting between firms are important in explaining the gender gap in wages, especially at the top of the wage distribution (Cardoso et al., 2016; Jewell et al., 2019).====There are many channels that show how the more high-performance and knowledge intensive work environments affect the gender wage gap. Some of the effects may work through Becker's (1957) taste-based discrimination channel, with the ability of firms to discriminate depending on the performance of the firm. At the same time, the adoption of more knowledge intensive technologies, such as IT technologies and other non-physical skill-intensive technologies has been shown in some past studies to act to complement female labour and thus likely contribute to lowering the gender pay gap (Weinberg 2000; Beaudry and Lewis 2014; Black and Spitz-Oener 2010).====Other types of effects may work in exactly the opposite direction. Recent studies by Goldin (2014) emphasize the role of lesser temporal flexibility for job purposes and more work interruptions in lowering women's wages relative to men, clearly showing the importance of this mechanism in the US. Goldin (2014) studies the impact of temporal flexibility or the lack of this in shaping the gender pay gap within different occupations. The channel of the effects that she outlines is the disproportionate size of rewards in some occupations and organisations for working longer hours, continuous hours or particular hours. This linked with the average higher ability or willingness of men to provide this temporal flexibility (or the perception of the firm that this is the case), can lead to a higher gender wage gap in organisations and occupations where temporal flexibility (24/7 availability for job purposes) of workforce matters a lot and where substitutability between individual employees is limited. There is evidence that inflexibility of working hours of women is one potential mechanism behind women earning lower premiums from firm export activity (Bøler et al., 2018) and foreign ownership (Vahter and Masso 2019). The net effect of investments in knowledge capital or the productivity of firms on gender wage gap depends on which type of effects dominate.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the role of parenthood in the gender wage gap. Event studies show that the motherhood penalty in wages is around the size of 7–10 log points (Kleven et al., 2019). There is usually a very small gender gap in wages when young people enter the labour market, while by the age of 40 it is already 15–20 log points (Goldin 2014; Card et al., 2016; Coudin et al., 2018; Bruns 2019; Jewell et al., 2019). There are only a few studies on the role of firm-level factors in the motherhood penalty. Coudin et al. (2018) find based on data from France that the sorting of women into lower-wage lower-performance firms is activated especially after the birth of a child. Further, they find that women are more likely to sort to work at firms closer to home after childbirth. Bruns (2019) shows evidence from Germany that firm-level wage premiums explain 20–30% of the increase in the gender wage gap after childbirth (Bruns 2019). A natural way to explain these findings is the lesser ability to offer temporal flexibility for job purposes in the case of mothers with young children. This reasoning builds on works by Goldin (2014) on the sources of the remaining gender wage gap in advanced countries and on experimental evidence on women's preferences concerning job flexibility such as Wiswall and Zafar (2018). The motherhood penalty may be higher at high-performance and high-wage firms, as these more rapidly developing firms may especially value the employee's temporal flexibility for job purposes and penalize the shortage of it.====We argue in this paper that the specifics of family-work policies matter for the link between firm level wage premiums and motherhood gender wage gap. The jobs of mothers are well protected in Estonia: mothers can temporarily leave their current job for up to three years in order to take care of the child and there are strong monetary incentives to use this maternity leave as 18 months of the leave are remunerated with 100% of the pre-child wage. Given this institutional background, we do not expect the role of firm level factors in gender wage gap to necessarily increase specifically at the time of childbirth, in contrast to the evidence from prior studies on this topic from other countries (in Bruns 2019 and Coudin et al., 2018).====The paper is organised as follows: the next section reviews the institutional background of our sample country Estonia, the third section discusses data and methodology, the fourth section evaluates the key assumptions of the two-way fixed effects estimation and presents the results, and the last section summarises.",The role of firms in the gender wage gap,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596721000639,1 November 2021,2021,Research Article,80.0

We find that new provincial leaders attract investment in industrial land from the provinces of their previous positions. The leaders’ impacts are greater when their freedom to deploy their business connections in the land market is greater. More importantly, we find evidence of positive impacts of land transactions on economic growth, which should bode well for the careers of the local leaders, albeit there is some evidence of rent seeking among officials especially when they are too old for further ====.","Whether leadership matters for economic growth has been an important topic for economists as well as political scientists. Previous research based on cross-country data, such as Jones and Olken (2005) and Besley et al. (2011), shows that national leadership has a causal effect on growth, although these studies suffer from the difficulty of controlling for country-specific characteristics. Yao and Zhang (2015) circumvent this problem by focusing on subnational leaders within a single country. Utilizing the unique setting of rotation of subnational leaders in China, they find that leadership matters, in the sense that subnational leaders have different levels of ability to promote economic growth. Despite the rich literature on ==== leadership matters, how local leadership utilize its political influence is still unclear. This paper aims to enrich the research on leadership by showing how leaders use their political influence and business connections to achieve short-term and long-term interests. Using data on China’s land transactions from 2007 to 2015, we find that newly appointed provincial leaders in China attract investment from the provinces of their previous positions in the primary industrial land market, and that their motivations include long-term career concerns and short-term rent seeking.====When local leaders in China are newly appointed through rotation, they are often far away from the regions of their previous positions, and thus they are “outsiders” with limited resources in their new positions. Facing competition for the next promotion, how do the newly appointed leaders boost the local economy? Scant research has been done to understand their strategies. Some anecdotal evidence shows that an important strategy for new provincial leaders is to seek resources and assistance from the provinces of their previous positions. For example, Li Xi was transferred from the position of deputy party secretary of Shanghai to party secretary of Liaoning in May 2015. Shortly after his transfer, in July 2015, a group of officials and entrepreneurs from Shanghai paid an official visit to Liaoning to discuss business cooperation.==== To reveal new provincial leaders’ strategies empirically, this study uses data on inter-provincial land transactions to examine whether newly appointed leaders attract investment from the provinces of their previous positions.====We focus on land transactions because land plays an essential role in economic development in China. Tao et al. (2010) argue that many local government officials have promoted local economic growth by pursuing industrialization and urbanization, which are based on land development. Local leaders can influence the land market because the primary land market is controlled by the government.==== Moreover, revenue from selling land has become an important source of public financing.==== Land revenue also has a positive effect on the promotion of officials, according to Chen and Kung’s 2016 study on land revenue windfalls of Chinese local governments. As a result, land is a crucial resource for political leaders in China and local leaders have incentives to utilize the land market for economic growth, which boosts their chances for promotion and possibly for immediate personal gains.====The reshuffles of local leaders across regions in China provide a unique setting to study how local leadership affects economic activities. In most countries, local leaders are elected by local voters based on local economic conditions, and thus the associated self-selection issue makes it difficult to identify the causal effect of local leadership on economic growth. In contrast, Chinese provincial leaders are assigned by the central government and often transferred from one region to another.==== The transfers of leaders are highly unpredictable. Even the newly assigned local leaders themselves have few clues where they will be assigned. For example, President Xi Jinping said during an interview that his transfer from Fujian to Zhejiang to serve as the party secretary was “completely unexpected.”==== The randomness in the transfers of local leaders facilitates a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis and enables us to identify the causal impact of local leaders on the land market.====Utilizing hand-collected data on transfers of provincial-level leaders and the Chinese land transaction data set, we find that after a new party secretary takes office in a province, a larger share of industrial land is purchased by companies from the province of his/her previous position.==== In other words, local leaders attract investment in the land market from the provinces of their previous positions. Our results survive a battery of robustness checks, such as different control specifications, placebo tests with random transfers of leaders, and zero-inflated Poisson regression. We also verify that leaders’ transfers are random in the sense that they cannot be predicted by potential determinants and confirm that our results are not driven by the overall opening up of the local land market for investors from all the other provinces; however, we find that transactions from leaders’ previous province may crowd out other cross-province transactions. Lastly, we show that our results remain robust when we use different definitions of land buyers, use different time lags in leaders’ transfers, aggregate to a higher level, and exclude special provinces and municipalities.====In addition, we find that leaders’ attraction of investment is subject to their ability to influence the land market. On the one hand, the impacts of leaders on the land market are weaker when they have smaller room and less freedom for maneuver. For example, leaders’ impacts are weaker for land granted by English auction than other methods, in provinces of higher levels of marketization, in the secondary market than primary market, for residential and commercial land than industrial land, after leaders leave office, and for provincial governors. On the other hand, the impacts are weaker when the utilizability of leaders’ business connections is lower. For example, party secretaries attract less investment when they are transferred from poorer provinces to richer provinces, and they attract less investment from the provinces of their second last positions, third last positions, or birthplaces. Further, the impacts of leaders’ transfers on the land market do not exist in the opposite direction, meaning that a new leader of a province is not found to help attract investment from the current province in land transactions in the province of his/her previous position. This is because the new leader has not yet cultivated business connections in the new province.====We show that an important motivation for leaders’ is to attract investment due to career concerns. We show that the leaders’ impacts on land transactions are stronger when the leaders have greater potential for promotion, and that the changes in the land market caused by leaders’ transfers is associated with economic growth. Short-term rent seeking may be another motivation. We find that the leaders’ impacts on the land market were weaker after the anti-corruption crackdowns that started in 2012. Further, companies from the provinces of leaders’ previous positions enjoy land price discounts especially when the leaders do not have potential for promotion.====Our paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, our study is related to the research on the effects of leadership on economic growth. Pioneer works, such as Jones and Olken (2005), Besley et al. (2011), and Yao and Zhang (2015), document the effects of national and subnational leadership on the economy. In comparison, our paper focuses on how local leadership matters, by investigating what newly assigned local leaders do and finding that they attract industrial land investment from the provinces of their previous positions, which boosts economic growth.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the effects of political rotation in China and how it could curb local protectionism. Political rotation is largely intended for honing officials’ skills (Zeng, 2016, Jiang and Mei, 2020). Prior research finds that the Chinese political tournament system helps boost the local economy when subnational leaders compete for promotion (Li and Zhou, 2005, Xu, 2011, Jia et al., 2015, Xi et al., 2018). We show that an important strategy of local leaders is to attract investment from the provinces of their previous positions after they are transferred. In addition, political rotation may mitigate the problem of local protectionism. Bai et al. (2004) find that local protectionism is prevalent in China, and Lu and Tao (2009) find that local protectionism obstructs the process of geographic concentration of manufacturing industries. Wang (2016) argues that rotation of local officials brings uncertainty to local business-government ties. Our results suggest that local leaders utilize their business connection from their previous positions when the leaders transfer to new places.====Third, our study is related to the literature on the impact of leaders’ transfers on inter-regional economic activities. Jiang and Mei (2020) examine the impact of the rotation of leaders on inter-provincial trade. Shi et al. (2020) finds that investment flows follow prefecture-level leaders’ transfers from their previous localities to their current localities. Our research focus on a specific type of investment, land transactions, which enables us to utilize the specific characteristics of land transactions (auction type, primary market/secondary market, etc.) to explore the mechanisms how leaders influence the land market.====The paper proceeds as follows.

To decrease these payments, we design an incentive scheme for business tax inspectors that rewards them according to the anonymous evaluation submitted by inspected firms. We show theoretically that incentives decrease the bribe amount, but make firms facing a more inelastic demand more attractive for inspectors. Attaching higher weights to the evaluation of smaller firms limits the scope for targeting. We evaluate both schemes in a field experiment in the Kyrgyz Republic. Our intervention reduces average business costs and prices, and increases tax revenues.","Firms in poor countries are routinely asked for bribes. According to the latest available World Bank Enterprise Survey data, 64.7% of firms in Cambodia have experienced at least one bribe payment request, as opposed to 1.9% in Sweden (World Bank 2017). These informal payment or gift requests often come from tax officials. However, bribes are not necessarily coercive: firms may be willing to pay bribes to avoid paying taxes. Yet, when regulatory transparency is low, court enforcement is poor, and the bureaucracy is inefficient, tax officials enjoy high bargaining power in their relationship with private firms, especially micro and small enterprises. This results in high bribe payments that increase the cost of doing business and negatively affect firm entry, exit, and growth.====In the environment described above, there is scope for policy interventions that reduce bribe payments by increasing the bargaining power of firms in their relationship with tax officials. Designing these interventions is challenging for several reasons. First, tax authorities in low-income countries often lack detailed information on the activity of tax officials and inspectors. This restricts the set of tools that can be used to increase their accountability. The rebalancing of bargaining power needs therefore to come at least partly from a mechanism that relies on the information provided by firms. Second, the mechanism needs to take into account firm heterogeneity. Firms are not all equally willing to engage in bribing relationships, and tax officials internalize this when choosing the target of their actions (Svensson, 2003, Olken and Barron, 2009). Third, and most importantly, any intervention that manages to lower bribe payments also makes bribery more attractive for those firms at the margin between paying the bribe or complying with the regulation and paying taxes. Bribery could therefore increase on the extensive margin, and tax revenues could decrease (Khan et al. 2016).====In this paper, we address these challenges and shed light on these trade-offs by designing and implementing an incentive scheme for business tax inspectors that rewards them based on the anonymous evaluation submitted by inspected firms. Our objective is to decrease bribe payments by increasing the bargaining power of firms in their relationship with tax officials. We test two variants of the incentive scheme in a field experiment that we ran in collaboration with The World Bank Group and the State Tax Service (STS) of the Kyrgyz Republic. In practice, we survey firms and ask them whether they were inspected by tax officials, and the inspected ones to evaluate the interaction occurred with the inspector on a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 indicates a perfect score. We preventively inform all tax inspectors in treatment areas of the exact scheme, and then pay tax inspectors in each local office a bonus that is linked to the average score submitted by inspected firms.====To inform our intervention design, we present a simple model that describes the interaction between firms and inspectors. Firms choose whether to pay taxes or to engage in informal relationships with tax inspectors and pay bribes. Inspectors decide which firms to inspect, and the amount of informal payment requested. Importantly, taxes take the form of a fixed-amount license fee, a common feature of taxation of micro and small enterprises around the world (Engelschalk and Loeprick 2015). In this environment, firm heterogeneity shapes the equilibrium bribery outcome. Under feedback incentives, inspectors face a trade-off between extracting bribes and getting high evaluations on behalf of inspected firms. They solve it by targeting more for inspections and bribes those firms for which bribery is less detrimental to profits and thus evaluation: those that can pass through more of the cost of bribes to consumers.====These considerations inform our intervention, which involves two treatments. In the first one, the bonus paid to inspectors is a piece rate that increases with the average evaluation submitted by inspected firms. Specifically, it rewards inspectors for the improvement in evaluation relative to the pre-intervention average at the local office level. The other treatment is also a piece rate that increases with the improvement in average evaluation, but this average is now weighted, with higher weights attached to the evaluation submitted by smaller firms. The objective of this tilted scheme is to disincentivize inspectors from targeting bigger firms with larger passthrough.====We randomly assigned 50 local tax offices and 356 inspectors in the Kyrgyz Republic – covering the entire country – to either one of these two treatment groups, or to a control group. Results show that, first, firms in both treatment arms are inspected less frequently and report lower bribes. The magnitudes are similar across treatments, but the negative effect on inspections is significant only under the tilted piece rate (PRT) incentive scheme while the negative impact on bribes is significant only under the unweighted piece rate (PR) scheme. Second, inspected firms in both treatment arms report lower average cost and charge lower prices. These effects are significant only under PR incentives, which is where bribes decrease significantly. We interpret the joint decrease in bribes, business cost, and prices as direct evidence of passthrough of bribes to consumers. Finally, tax revenues increase in both treatment arms, and significantly so under PRT incentives, where inspection rates decrease significantly. This is consistent with the hypothesis that officials allow firms to substitute bribes for taxes during inspections.====We provide a number of additional pieces of evidence that are consistent with the theoretical model and its predictions. In particular, the average inspected firm under the PR scheme faces a demand curve that is significantly more inelastic: an indication of larger passthrough. In contrast, we find no evidence of such targeting under the PRT scheme, which discourages the targeting of large firms. The model also predicts a larger decrease in the bribe amount under the PR scheme, consistent with the significant decrease in bribes and prices that we find in the experiment.====Our paper contributes to the literature on corruption, firms, and development.==== Countries with high levels of corruption have low fiscal capacity and low GDP level and growth (Mauro, 1995, Tanzi, 1998, Svensson, 2005, Besley and Persson, 2014). Although substantial progress has been made in measurement, it is still unclear how large the inefficiencies brought by corruption are.==== For private firms, bribes can be more or less distortionary than taxes depending on whether the resulting effective marginal tax rate is higher or lower. Using survey data from Uganda, Fisman and Svensson (2007) show that a percentage point increase in the bribery rate is associated with a reduction in firm growth that is about three times greater than the one associated with the same increase in tax rate. Sequeira and Djankov (2014) use data on South African firms and show how they adapt to different types of corruption by adjusting their transport strategies. Evidence from survey data indicates that firms are willing to incur in higher transport costs to avoid the uncertainty associated with illicit payments. Svensson (2003) investigates the determinants of bribery among firms. He finds that variation in policies and regulations across industries correlates significantly with the incidence of bribes. He also finds that, within sectors, current and expected future profitability and estimated alternative return on capital can explain a large part of the variation in bribes across firms. Olken and Barron (2009) use originally collected data on illegal payments made by Indonesian truck drivers to show how the market structure of the bureaucracy affects the amount of bribes charged. They also find that corrupt officials adopt complex pricing schemes. Our results are consistent with these studies in showing how firm heterogeneity shapes the informal relationships between firms and tax officials. We focus on a novel and specific margin: the elasticity of the demand firms face and, accordingly, the extent of passthrough of bribes to consumers using prices.====The results in Olken and Barron (2009) also suggest that changing the organization of the bureaucracy and increasing its efficiency is key in order to address corruption. One possible approach is to reward inspectors according to the amount of tax revenues they generate (“tax farming”). Khan et al. (2016) design and evaluate such incentive scheme for property tax inspectors. By linking their salary to the amount of taxes they collect, the scheme increases the bargaining power of tax inspectors, which leads to the disruption of some informal agreements between taxpayers and inspectors. As a result, tax revenues increase. However, most taxpayers report no change in tax paid, and higher and more frequent bribes. Khan et al. (2016) also experiment with a scheme that rewards inspectors according to both the amount of tax revenues they generate and reported taxpayer satisfaction and accuracy of tax assessments. They find the positive impact on tax revenues to be lower in this case, while customer satisfaction and quality perceptions increase slightly.====There are several important differences between our paper and Khan et al. (2016), which make the two studies complementary. First, we focus on business rather than property taxation, and on how firm heterogeneity and market structure shape the equilibrium response to incentives. Second, our primary objective is to decrease bribes, which can increase the cost of doing business, limit firm entry, dampen firm growth, and hurt consumers through higher prices. The feedback incentive scheme we propose achieves this goal by increasing the bargaining power of firms, with no negative impact on tax revenues.====More generally, our study contributes to a growing literature in development economics that studies the organization of the bureaucracy, incentives and selection of public sector workers in low-income countries (Dal Bó et al., 2013, Ashraf et al., 2014, Finan et al., 2017, Rasul and Rogger, 2018, Best et al., 2017, Deserranno, 2019, Deserranno et al., 2021, Caria et al., 2021).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

How does the dominance of an ethnic group affect discrimination under various political regimes? We build a theory to analyse such questions. In our model, political leaders (democratically elected or not) decide on the allocation of spending on different types of public goods: a general public good and an ethnically-targetable public good which benefits the majority ethnic group while imposing a cost on the other minorities. We show that, under democracy, lower ethnic dominance leads to greater provision of the general public good while higher dominance implies higher provision of the ethnically-targetable good. Interestingly, the opposite relation obtains under dictatorship. This implies that political regime changes can favour or disfavour minorities based on the ambient level of ethnic dominance. Several historical events involving regime changes can be analysed within our framework and are consistent with our results.","Discrimination against minorities – ethnic, religious, linguistic, etc. – is a serious concern worldwide. Sometimes such discrimination takes an overt form via directed violence, forcible segregation (residential and or occupational).==== In many contexts this is more covert, working through discrimination in the labour market (manifest in hiring decisions, glass ceilings, etc.) or even through the public offices by provision of lower/inferior public goods (roads, infrastructure, health facilities, educational institutions, etc.). Such systematic exclusion of segments of the population is damaging not only from a normative perspective — there are potential economic inefficiencies arising out of this. The role of political institutions in determining various economic outcomes has received much attention in the recent years.==== Typically, democracies are perceived to be superior to non-democracies on many dimensions; particularly, on the allocation of public spending (see e.g., Tavares and Wacziarg (2001), Deacon (2009), Acemoglu et al. (2014)). So can the issue of discrimination against minorities be mitigated by superior institutional structures like democracy? In other words, is discrimination necessarily lower under democracies as opposed to dictatorships? Recent events suggest otherwise. Consider the recent surge in violence against the Muslim Rohingya community in Myanmar — this is ==== a democratically elected government assumed power.==== Therefore, can one pin down which factors might condition the degree of discrimination under different political regimes? In particular, how does the presence of a dominant ethnic group affect discrimination under various political regimes? Here, we put forward a tractable theory to answer such questions.====Our theory considers two alternative political regimes: democracy and dictatorship. In our model, the society is composed of a dominant ethnic group and an amalgamation of many other (minority) groups. Irrespective of the political regime, one of the main tasks of the government is to allocate public spending. Such spending has an important role to play in the economy, particularly in boosting output and economic growth.==== Political parties within a democracy would understandably take this spending seriously, as their terms in office would depend quite critically on this. For dictators, who are not elected through popular mandate, there is an alternative incentive to direct public spending in a certain way: they would typically embezzle a portion for themselves, while also ensuring that they minimise the chances of a popular uprising.====We introduce the notion of discrimination in this setting in the following manner: two kinds of public spending are possible in this society. The first type is on a “general” public good which benefits everyone irrespective of their ethnic background, while the other, an “ethnic” public good, benefits only the dominant ethnic group.==== Moreover, this latter good apart from being exclusionary imposes a ==== cost (psychological, material, etc.) on the members of the non-dominant ethnic groups. Instances of such targetting are not difficult to come by — e.g., a formal proclamation of ethnic identities, in particular delineating the national identity in terms of that of the dominant ethnic group (via the funding of ethnic or cultural-specific goods, festivals, etc.), which would reduce the stature of the minorities to “second class citizens”. Hence, whenever there is a positive amount spent on the ethnic good, it is classified as discrimination in our setup — ==== Given that this “ethnic good” is actually publicly provided, the theory we develop is pertinent to overt forms of discrimination — specifically, where the state has the potential to favour certain segments of society at the cost of others. There is, however, heterogeneity in the preferences for this “ethnic” good within the dominant ethnic group — some value it more than others.====We first study a democratic setting with two parties which compete for the citizens’ votes by each proposing tax rates on incomes and thereby promising budgetary allocations on the two public goods. Like in Acemoglu and Robinson (2006), we assume that citizens of any ethnic group can either be poor or rich. Here, we show that the equilibrium allocation of public spending depends heavily upon the extent of ethnic dominance. Below a certain threshold level of ethnic dominance, the entire budget is spent on the general public good; above this threshold, the spending is entirely on the ethnic public good. This is intuitive, as in the absence of a “large” dominant group, political parties will strive to compete for votes from all sections of the population (and hence invest in the general public good), while in the presence of such a group, the parties would spend all of their energies in catering to that group (thereby investing in the ethnic good) even at the cost of antagonising the minorities. The fact that parties can adjust the tax rate suitably to garner support among the different income groups does not interfere with this core logic.====In the case of a dictatorial regime, there is no explicit role for political parties. The dictator decides on the tax rate and the allocation of public spending with largely two considerations in mind: appropriation of the public funds (“rents”) and surviving any potential uprising by the citizens. In the eventuality of a successful revolt, there is a return to the two-party democratic regime and the dictator is disallowed from appropriating any amount of the public budget. Thus, the dictator has to factor in how the different income earners ==== the ethnic groups will react – i.e., support a rebellion or not – when he makes his public spending allocation. Clearly, the decision by any citizen would depend upon what she thinks the alternative scenario (in this case, democracy) will deliver to her. Since, whatever democracy delivers depends upon how large the dominant ethnic group the society is, the dictator effectively operates in this “shadow of democracy”. Therefore, the dictator’s actions also depend upon the level of ethnic dominance.====We show that when ethnic dominance is lower than a certain threshold, the dictator tilts spending (if any) entirely towards the dominant ethnic group.==== When ethnic dominance is sufficiently high, the dictator may invest only in the general public good; in fact, the spending on the ethnic good (if any) is strictly lower than that under democracy. In other words, in society with little ethnic dominance the dictator will actually only cater to the dominant ethnicity while neglecting the minorities. It is precisely a society with a large dominant ethnic group which will witness little or no discrimination. Observe that this is completely ==== to the equilibrium policy under democracy.====The intuition for this result is the following: with low ethnic dominance, the minority group has a strong incentive to rebel since they know that they will benefit from the general public spending in case the dictator is ousted and elections take place. So dissuading them is too costly for the dictator. In order to prevent members of the dominant group from joining the rebellion, targetted ethnic spending has to be offered to that group by the dictator. Alternatively, the dictator may simply cater to the rich citizens by lowering tax rates and not providing any public spending.====Conversely, with high ethnic dominance, the dominant group has an incentive to rebel since under democracy the entire spending will be directed towards them (maximum possible discrimination). In this situation, the minority group will typically not rebel since democracy will not bring them any enjoyment of the public spending. Therefore, in order to dissuade some members of the majority from rebelling, a positive amount of only the general public good may be offered by the dictator. Discrimination need not be optimal from the dictator’s perspective since under democracy the ==== spending would be in favour of the dominant ethnic group. Hence the dictator tries to dissuade rebellion by committing to little or no discrimination. As a result, the pattern of discrimination – particularly, how it varies with the size of dominant ethnic majority – is strikingly different in a democracy as opposed to a dictatorship.====In our setup, the extent of appropriation is an endogenous choice variable for the dictator. This allows us to document the relationship between ethnic dominance and this level of appropriation by the dictator. Our results provide a rationale – based on the size of the dominant ethnic group – for why one observes a different ==== of discrimination and not just a different ==== of public spending in dictatorships as opposed to democracies.====Our theory can be used to interpret certain historical events like the changing nature of Hutu-Tutsi relations in Rwanda, the treatment of Chinese Indonesians during and after the Suharto regime and more recently the issue of persecution of the Rohingya community in Myanmar and that of Muslim citizens in India. Each of these scenarios when viewed through the lens of our model appear to be consistent with the model’s predictions. We offer a more detailed treatment of each of these cases later.====The remainder of the paper is organised in the following way: Section 2 provides a discussion of the related literature. Section 3 develops the theory and presents the analytical results. Section 4 discusses a possible extension, Section 5 contains some discussion regarding certain historical events in light of our theory and Section 6 concludes.

Counterfactual simulations suggest that the benefits of FDI outweigh the costs for these countries. On average, a 1% increase in the share of foreign firms is associated with a 0.17% increase in welfare. However, incentivising foreign firms to reinvest more of their profits domestically is, ====, welfare-improving. A 10-percentage-point increase in the profit ==== rate is associated with a 1.06% welfare gain on average.","Transition economies tend to attract more capital from abroad, especially foreign direct investment (FDI), as they gradually become more integrated in the world economy (Brenton et al., 1999, Buch et al., 2003). The Visegrád 4 group (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) have particularly excelled at this over the past couple of decades (Bevan and Estrin, 2004). As a result, these four countries have accumulated a relatively large amount of FDI — so much so that the important presence of foreign firms has become a topic of policy discussion in these economies. Many other current or former transition economies have not been as successful at attracting large amounts of FDI (Carstensen and Toubal, 2004), so the question arises as to whether they should actively seek to follow the V4 in doing so.====Foreign direct investment is often considered to be a positive contributor to a country’s welfare. One of the key reasons for this is that foreign-owned firms facilitate the transfer of technology across borders (Yao and Wei, 2007), which can raise productivity and growth rates (Ford et al., 2008, Grossman and Helpman, 1991). However, an almost mechanical counterpart of FDI is profit outflows. As foreign companies invest in an economy, they often repatriate a substantial share of their profits (Akkermans, 2017, Graham et al., 2011, Seabra and Flach, 2005).====In terms of national accounting, these profit outflows are recorded on the primary income account, which is part of the current account. Net profit outflows from a country result in primary income deficits, which, when sizeable, can significantly affect the current account balance (CAB) as CAB = TB + PIB + SIB, where TB is the trade balance, PIB is the primary income balance, and SIB is the secondary income balance (e.g. remittances, foreign aid).====It has been well-documented that the primary income balance has gradually become a more important component in the current account (Adler and Garcia-Macia, 2018, Akkermans, 2017, Forbes et al., 2017, Langhammer, 2012, Strauss, 2016). This is seen as a result of the globalisation of financial markets (Forbes et al., 2017) and the expansion of FDI (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2018). While the primary income account includes flows from other sources such as portfolio investment as well, Joyce (2021) documents that for emerging markets the key contributor to PIB deficits are FDI-related profit outflows.====Traditionally, analyses of current account balances have focused on the trade balance, which has historically been its most important component. But the trends described above suggest this may no longer be the case. Both Joyce (2021) and Forbes et al. (2017) point out that PIB deficits are so large in some countries that they are rivalling the trade balance, thereby significantly affecting the current account balance. This is especially true for emerging markets.====The profit outflows induced by FDI can be problematic. Reis (2001) highlights how in an endogenous growth model: when foreign-owned firms enter an economy, they take a chunk of aggregate profits that used to accrue to domestic firms. While the size of the pie (aggregate profits) is likely larger as a result of more FDI, the size of the slice (amount of profits) going to foreign-owned firms will also be higher. If foreign-owned firms repatriate a significant fraction of their profits, then the overall amount of profits staying in the country may actually be lower as a result of FDI.====Theory thus suggests that the welfare effects of FDI are ambiguous. On the one hand, more productive foreign-owned firms should mechanically increase a country’s productivity, and they may also lead to technological transfers and spillovers. This can push wages up, prices down, and create more product variety — all contributing to higher welfare. On the other hand, with more FDI a higher share of profits accrues to foreign-owned firms. Given that foreign-owned firms tend to repatriate a significant chunk of their profits, FDI may lead to a lower amount of profits retained in the economy, which can shift households’ budget constraints inward leading to a loss of welfare.====This paper quantitatively investigates which of these forces prevail. The focus is on four emerging economies in East-Central Europe, the so-called Visegrád 4 (V4). The paper employs a general equilibrium model featuring the trade-off outlined above.====The V4 countries are composed of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. The paper focuses on these four countries because the net effect of FDI has been subject to considerable debate in the context of the V4 (Piketty, 2018, Bershidsky, 2018, Darvas, 2018). The V4 have actively focused on attracting FDI (Narula and Bellak, 2009), and are among the biggest recipients of FDI per capita when compared to other emerging markets (Medve-Bálint, 2014). Reasons for this include the accession of these countries to the European Union in 2004, which makes them an attractive FDI destination for EU firms (Medve-Bálint, 2014, Baldwin et al., 1997, Breuss, 2002), especially given their relatively low labour costs and a well-trained labour force (Bevan and Estrin, 2004, Galego et al., 2004, Gauselmann et al., 2011, Nölke and Vliegenthart, 2009).====The impact of high FDI in the V4 is well-illustrated by the high market share of foreign-controlled firms in these economies. Fig. 1(a) shows that this is hovering around 40%–50% in the V4 countries as opposed to 25%–30% in other EU economies.====As expected, the flip side of high FDI and an important foreign firm presence is high profit outflows. Fig. 1(b) shows that outgoing primary income payments (PI debit) overall make up a significantly higher fraction of GDP in V4 countries (6%–14%) than in Germany or the entire EU (4%–5%). To a large extent, this difference is driven by the repatriated and reinvested profits of foreign-owned corporations, which comprise a much larger fraction of outgoing primary income payments in the V4 than in the rest of the EU. While reinvested profits are accompanied by an identical inflow on the financial account, repatriated profits are not. And indeed, repatriated profits are large enough to rival the size of the trade balance in V4 countries – a pattern that is less prevalent in other EU countries. By plotting the inverse primary income balance (PIB debit less PIB credit), Fig. 1(b) also shows that incoming primary income payments are not large enough to offset the relatively high outgoing payments in V4 countries. This is illustrated by the fact that the primary income account is in a 1.8–5.4% deficit in V4 countries compared to a 0–2.5% surplus in Germany and the EU as a whole. This underscores the fact that FDI activity and the resultant profit flows have a relatively important impact on the balance-of-payments accounts of V4 countries. It is for these reasons, in addition to the fact that this topic has received considerable attention in the media and in policy circles in these countries, that the paper focuses on the V4.====Methodologically, a general equilibrium model is built featuring both the positive effect of foreign-owned firms on productivity, and their negative effect on profits retained domestically. Firms are heterogeneous and can be either domestic or foreign-owned. On the one hand, foreign-owned firms are more productive and tend to be larger. This has positive macroeconomic effects by decreasing prices, and increasing wages and aggregate profits. On the other hand, foreign-owned firms repatriate a fraction of their profits, while all of domestic firms’ profits are paid out as dividends to households. This means that the presence of foreign firms may shift households budget constraint inward creating an adverse macroeconomic effect.====The coexistence of a cost and a benefit to having foreign-owned firms in the economy implies that this model can generate a positive, a negative, or a non-linear relationship between the share of foreign-owned firms and aggregate welfare. To discipline the model and to connect it to the data, it is calibrated to the case of the V4 economies to match the firm revenue distribution, the relative productivity of foreign and domestic firms, and the market share of foreign firms. The calibrated model is then used to carry out counterfactual simulations to estimate the welfare effects of foreign firm presence.====There are three key findings. First, further increasing the number of foreign-owned firms in the V4 economies would on net be beneficial for welfare. This result holds for all four countries. On average, increasing the number of foreign-owned firms by 1% would lead to a 0.21% gain in welfare. The country-specific estimates are 0.05% for Poland, 0.19% for Hungary, 0.23% for the Czech Republic, and 0.37% for Slovakia. The effect is not symmetric: on average, reducing the number of foreign-owned firms by 1% would lead to a 0.13% loss of welfare.==== The country-specific estimates are a 0.02% loss in the Czech Republic, 0.11% in Slovakia, 0.18% in Hungary, and 0.20% in Poland. Due to the large productivity advantage of foreign-owned firms and the relatively low share of profits in total income, the benefit of FDI easily outweighs the cost in the V4 countries.====The second key finding is that, as expected, increasing the share of profits that are reinvested by foreign-owned firms would increase welfare in all countries. On average, increasing the reinvestment rate by 10 percentage points would lead to a 1.06% improvement in welfare. Hungary and the Czech Republic would both experience a 0.93% gain, Poland’s gain would be 1.09%, and Slovakia’s 1.29%. The combination of the paper’s two key results gives rise to a policy trade-off: incentivising the domestic reinvestment of profits can improve welfare, but could potentially reduce the number of foreign-owned firms present offsetting some of the welfare gains. Simulations suggest that if reinvestment rates were raised by 1%, then net welfare gains would be positive as long as the share of foreign firms does not decline too much in response. The Czech Republic can withstand a 1.05% decline in the share of foreign firms, Hungary around 0.76%, Poland around 0.40%, and Slovakia only 0.07%.====Finally, the third finding is that the current account impact of foreign firms is negative: having more foreign firms lowers the current account balance. Perhaps contrary to expectations, however, the culprit for this is not profit repatriation. In fact, as it is indicated in the discussion of Fig. 1(b) above, both repatriated and reinvested profits are recorded as primary income outflows, so how these two are split does not matter from the perspective of the primary income account. It does matter from the perspective of the trade balance, however. The model suggests that repatriated profits improve the trade balance by lowering domestic income and thus boosting the fraction of output that needs to be exported — thereby offsetting the negative primary income effect of repatriated profits. Reinvested profits, on the other hand, have the opposite effect: they reduce exports by increasing domestic income and hence have a negative effect on the current account. It must be noted though that reinvested profits are automatically accompanied by an identical inflow on the financial account, so current account deficits arising from them should not be problematic from the perspective of external finance.====The limitations of the paper are two-fold. First, productivity spillovers from foreign to domestic firms are ignored. However, empirical estimates of these spillovers vary considerably, and meta-analyses find negative to non-existent spillovers (Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare, 2010, Wooster and Diebel, 2010, Mebratie and van Bergeijk, 2013, Herzer, 2012), especially in more developed emerging markets such as the V4 (Nicolini and Resmini, 2010). Second, the paper ignores some additional costs of FDI that have been proposed in the literature. These include, for instance, the ability of foreign firms to access international capital markets more easily (Reis, 2001) or their higher reliance on imported inputs (Rodríguez-Clare, 1996). Addressing these issues in a quantitative framework is difficult due to a lack of data availability.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.

We combine daily information on conflict events and government policy responses to limit the spread of SARS CoV-2 to study how demonstrations and violent events vary following shutdown policies. We use the staggered implementation of restriction policies across countries to identify the dynamic effects in an ==== framework. Our results show that imposing a nation-wide shutdown is associated with a reduction in the number of demonstrations, which suggests that public demonstrations are hampered by the rising cost of participation. However, the reduction is short-lived, as the number of demonstrations are back to their pre-restriction levels in two months. In contrast, we observe that the purported increase in mobilization or coordination costs, following the imposition of restrictions, is not followed by a drop of violent events that involve organized armed groups. Instead, we find that the number of events, on average, increases slightly following the implementation of the restriction policies. The rise in violent events is most prominent in poorer countries, with higher levels of polarization, and in authoritarian countries. We discuss the potential channels underlying this heterogeneity.","On March 31, 2020 the U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, cautioned that the SARS CoV-2 epidemic could lead to “enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict”. The SARS CoV-2 epidemic can exacerbate conflict by upending social and political protections. The effect could be severe for the vulnerable populations: those caught up in war and persecution, or those living in densely populated areas with dismal state capacity.==== Critically, countries have responded with varying degree of restrictions to limit the spread of SARS CoV-2. The policy response to the pandemic can itself have a bearing on conflict situations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that mobility restrictions to flatten the epidemic curve, that increase the mobilization and coordination costs, have a direct and negative effect on conflict. For instance, anti-corruption protests in Iraq and Lebanon came to a screeching halt following the announcement of the pandemic,==== while India’s lockdown terminated nationwide protests against the mistreatment of Muslims.==== The flipside is rising scapegoating of minorities or vulnerable groups, especially when states are preoccupied with combating the pandemic.==== Moreover, authoritarian regimes could also use the global preoccupation with SARS CoV-2 as an opportunity to crush armed opposition. For example, the Myanmar military stepped up its offensive against ethnic armed rebel groups in Rakhine, Chin, Karen and northern Shan state,==== while the United Nations appealed for a global ceasefire to countervail the escalation in violence.==== Some regimes may also use the global epidemic as an opportunity to stifle democratic opposition. In Azerbaijan, members of the opposition parties were locked up for allegedly violating a lockdown.====The policies imposed to contain the pandemic have also hampered economic activity. The World Bank estimates a 4.6% decline in world GDP per capita in 2020, which earmarks the worst recession since the Second World War.====, ====, ====), and by hampering the capacity of the state to fight opponents or buy off opposition (====; ====). On the other hand, states with more limited resources are less attractive “prizes” to be seized, which may lead to a decrease in conflict intensity (====, ====).====In this paper, we provide evidence on how enforcing restrictions to limit the spread of SARS CoV-2 affects conflicts globally and how conflict dynamics vary across types of events, and depend intrinsically on country-specific socio-economic or institutional contexts. We take advantage of the joint release of daily information on conflict events by the ==== dataset, on the one hand, and on government policy responses by the Oxford ====-19 Government Response Tracker, on the other hand, to estimate how shutdown policies are correlated to the dynamic of conflict outcomes. We use a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits the cross-country variation in the timing of restriction policies. Studying how restriction policies shape conflict behavior is subject to its own methodological challenges. First, estimates are likely to be biased because the SARS CoV-2 pandemic dynamics, and how people responded to it, can be systematically different between countries that implemented restriction measures and the non-implementing countries (====). Second, countries have implemented a host of measures to contain the pandemic spread, which makes comparison in terms of the policy treatment difficult (====).====). We further include country-specific time trends to account for trends in initial country characteristics, such as income levels or population density, that can jointly determine the pandemic and the conflict dynamics. We also estimate the conflict dynamics around specific restriction policies to address whether countries are comparable in terms of the restrictions they implemented. In the sensitivity analysis we compare the evolution of conflict events around eight types of restrictions – which include policies like shelter-in-place, closure of schools, restriction on internal move, etc. – separately.====We uncover a compelling pattern of conflict dynamics around restriction policies depending on the nature of the conflict. We find three striking results for demonstrations, which include spontaneous acts of rioting or protesting. First, we observe a sharp decline in demonstrations following the imposition of restriction policies. The magnitude of the effect is sizeable: our estimates imply a decline by 0.8 demonstration events per day during the first month, which is substantial compared to the sample average of 1.5 events. Our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, and especially, to the inclusion a full set of interactions between restriction indicators and a measure of country-specific media freedom, which alleviates concern that the decline in demonstrations can be driven by short-term constraints on media reporting. Overall, the evidence is in line with the literature on political demonstrations which suggests that public rallies are hampered by factors that raise the opportunity cost of participation (====, ====). Second, the reduction is short-lived, as the number of demonstrations are back to their pre-restriction levels in the second month, and remain there in the subsequent periods. Third, this U-shaped dynamic is similar across regions, when we consider specific restriction measures, and across countries with different socio-economic or institutional contexts. We further explore whether a return to pre-pandemic behavior, due to countries relaxing the mobility or social distancing constraints, can explain the resurgence in demonstrations. Restricting the sample to countries that imposed the restriction policies for at least three months, we observe a similar resurgence in demonstration activity, which suggests that the easing of mobility constraints is not the first-order determinant of the resurgence.====Our results suggest that the short-lived decline in demonstrations can be due to two non-exclusive explanations: the negative economic consequences of the restriction policies could have fueled public resentment or individuals may have overtime discounted the potential health risk from the pandemic. While there is substantial anecdotal evidence for economic deprivation having contributed to rising demonstrations across countries,==== we use different empirical exercises to assess if the information-based mechanism can be an important determinant. We find that the timing of a country having implemented restriction policies compared to rest of the region, the scale of SARS CoV-2 related fatalities in the neighborhood, or access to information technology has no bearing on demonstration activity across countries. We therefore consider the rise in public resentment to be a more likely explanation for the resurgence in demonstrations. Alternatively, we estimate whether the observed drop in demonstrations can be due to a temporary substitution between online and offline protests, using monthly data on the number of petitions and signatures from ====. We fail to detect any substitution towards online protests in the immediate aftermath of the restrictions. This non-result should however be interpreted with caution because of data limitation in measuring online protests (shorter time-period and absence of daily dimension).====In contrast, we observe that the purported increase in mobilization or coordination costs, following the imposition of restrictions, is not associated with a decline in violent events involving organized armed groups. If anything, the number of events, on average, increases slightly in the aftermath of the policies’ implementation. This lack of correlation between restriction policies and violent events however masks a significant heterogeneity. First, we observe negligible link between restriction policies and violent events in Latin America, while we uncover a positive association in Asia and Africa. We also consider specific restriction policies and find that the surge in violent events is mostly associated with the imposition of shelter-in-place and restrictions to internal movements policies. Second, we assess whether countries where the roots of conflict are present – such as countries with high poverty, ethno-religious strife or non-democratic institutions – are particularly susceptible to rise in violent events following the policy responses to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. We find a rise in violent events in poorer countries, which could be due either to the lower opportunity cost of fighting (====, ====, ====) or the lower state capacity to fight armed opposition (====; ====). The escalation in violent events is also more conspicuous in countries with higher ethno-religious polarization or fractionalization, which is in line with evidence that pandemics provide a pretext for the scapegoating of minorities (====, ====). Finally, we find that authoritarian countries are more amenable to violent conflicts in the aftermath of restrictions. This result is consistent with evidence that authoritarian leaders are incentivized to repress their challengers, especially when the “world is not watching” (====).====, ====, ====), the role of climate, or mass media in spreading SARS CoV-2 (====, ====). Notably, ==== study the effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the virus. Closest to our study, our exercise complements the analysis in ====, who investigate the links between SARS CoV-2 and conflict using a number of country-specific case studies. Our approach pools many countries together, and by doing so ignores a number of potentially important sources of heterogeneity; on the other hand, we hope to uncover regularities that can help to understand and anticipate some of the main threats associated with the current restrictions. Next, we contribute to the literature on infectious diseases and civil conflicts, which shows that health shocks from infectious diseases can potentially cause civil conflicts (====). We highlight that policy response to an epidemic can significantly impact civil conflicts in contexts where the roots of conflicts are already present. We finally contribute to the literature that distinguishes between conflict events based on the actors involved or on the choice of tactics (====, ====, ====, ====). We complement this literature by highlighting a significant heterogeneity in the drivers of conflict that involve general public versus those which involve organized armed groups. The next section discusses the theoretical channels and anecdotal evidence to motivate the relationship between SARS CoV-2 restrictions and conflict outcomes. Section ==== presents the data and our baseline research design. Section ==== discusses the results and their robustness, and Section ==== concludes.====The following is the Supplementary material related to this article. ====

"Kailthya Subham,Kambhampati Uma","University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK,University of Reading, Whiteknights, RG6 6AH, UK","Received 28 February 2019, Revised 20 August 2021, Accepted 24 August 2021, Available online 24 September 2021, Version of Record 21 February 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jce.2021.08.001,Cited by (3),A denser ,"Transportation plays a vital role in stimulating economic growth. But, in many emerging economies including India and China, inadequate transportation infrastructure is a common problem that hinders manufacturing growth (Jedwab and Moradi, 2016, Ghani et al., 2016a). A recent World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) reports that 19 per cent of manufacturing firms globally, 21 per cent of firms in South Asia, and about 10 per cent of firms in India find inadequate transportation infrastructure as a major obstacle (World Bank, 2014). Not surprisingly, this has spurred governments in many emerging economies to invest in large-scale transportation projects to stimulate economic activity.==== Yet, our understanding of how closing the transportation infrastructure gap affects manufacturing productivity is far from complete. The knowledge gap is particularly acute for emerging economies where poor connectivity inhibits economic growth. In this paper, we provide causal estimates of the effect of roads on manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP) within a developing country context and show how the effect varies by plant-specific characteristics and road type.====The literature on the economic impact of transportation infrastructure can be organized into three distinct strands. The first focuses on the economic returns from highways connecting nodal cities. Prominent examples of this approach include the study of the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) highway in India and the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) in China (Ghani et al., 2016a, Ghani et al., 2016b, Datta, 2012, Asturias et al., 2018, Faber, 2014). The second concentrates on the impact of rural roads on village economies (Aggarwal, 2018, Bohlken, 2019, Asher and Novosad, 2020), while the third creates a synthetic index of infrastructure to examine how the overall infrastructure index affects manufacturing activity (Mitra et al., 2002, Mitra et al., 2012). Although these studies provide useful insight, knowledge gaps remain. For instance, while studies that examine the impact of GQ highways are internally valid they may not be generalizable given that GQ highways cover less than 0.1 per cent of India’s road network. Moreover, these studies examine the impact of roads on local economic activity at the extensive margin i.e. the additional benefit of new or improved highways, but pays little attention to the impact at the intensive margin i.e. the effect of a denser transportation network which might be illuminating.====In this paper, we provide causal estimates of the impact of roads on manufacturing TFP. To do this, we combine plant-level panel data on Indian manufacturing with sub-national data on road transportation network, disaggregated by type, from 1998 to 2012. An important challenge in estimating the impact of roads on economic activity is that roads are not randomly placed (Banerjee et al., 2020, Shatz et al., 2011 etc.). For example, roads might be more prevalent in places that trade more i.e. when roads are built to support trade or, if they trade less i.e. when roads are built to encourage trade (Duranton et al., 2014). We address the endogeneity of road placement by exploiting cross-state variation in the strength of centre-state partisan alignment or, ==== for short, that asymmetrically stimulates road building in aligned states. Here, we consider a state to be aligned with the centre if its ruling party is the same as that governing the centre or if it is a member of the ruling central coalition. The premise is that aligned states face fewer economic and non-economic hurdles in implementing public projects such as roads. Obstacles in the form of delays in land acquisition, obtaining planning permission, vetting of tenders etc. might stall projects entirely. Aligned states, however, face fewer such obstacles and are much more likely to see road projects being implemented in comparison to non-aligned states.====We believe that this is a credible identification strategy for several reasons: First, plant-level productivity is not directly influenced by political-market bargaining that determines alignment strength. Secondly, as far as possible, our electoral outcomes pre-date road building data. In our analysis, the average lag between these variables is two years which attenuates potential concerns around reverse feedback from road building onto electoral outcomes. In addition, elections in India are staggered across groups of states which further reduces the possibility of simultaneity bias. Third, we control for a range of potential confounders in our regression to ensure that omitted variables are not affecting our results. We discuss this further in Section 4.2. However, these approaches cannot rule out endogeneity completely. Hence, we conduct sensitivity checks to ensure that our estimates are robust to potential imperfections in the instrument. To this end, we generate bounds on the treatment effect that relaxes the assumption of strict exogeneity of the instrument with sign restrictions using the approach developed by Nevo and Rosen (2012). Further, we test the sensitivity of our result to plausible violations of the exclusion restriction based on the method by van Kippersluis and Rietveld (2018). We discuss these identification tests in Section 5.2.====To preview our main results, we find that after controlling for endogeneity, a 1% increase in road density raises value-added TFP by about 0.25%, on average. Thus, moving a state from the 10th percentile of the road density distribution to the 50th percentile will raise TFP by about 13%. Furthermore, we show that these gains are due to a reallocation of inputs in favour of higher productivity firms within an industry (see Appendix D). However, a closer examination reveals that the effect of roads on TFP varies by plant-specific characteristics and road type. Younger establishments are more likely to gain from a denser road network with highways playing a prominent role. These results are robust to using alternative measures of TFP, employing the percentage change in road density as the main covariate, estimating the model on alternative sub-samples, guarding against outliers and accounting for spatial spillovers. In addition, to alleviate concerns regarding measurement error arising from using a state-level aggregate measure of road density, we examine the robustness of our results to using district-level road density for a smaller sub-sample for which detailed data was available and find qualitatively similar results.==== The existing literature proposes two broad mechanisms by which an improvement in transportation infrastructure stimulates economic activity. First, it reduces trade barriers by lowering transportation cost which leads to greater market integration. The arterial network of roads and railways have played a fundamental role in increasing trade volumes by expanding market access. Donaldson (2015) reviews theoretical and empirical research on the gains from market integration as a result of reduced trade barriers, while Redding and Turner (2015) review the role of transportation costs on the spatial distribution of economic activity. In the context of developing countries, using global oil prices to provide exogenous variation in transport costs, Storeygard (2016) finds that the economic activity of African cities that are further away from roads suffers more than cities that are nearer during high oil price years. In India, Ghani et al. (2016a) utilize the time-variation in GQ highway construction/ upgrading and find that industries located nearer to highways produce more output and do so with higher efficiency.====Secondly, a reliable transportation network lowers uncertainty at both the procurement and supply stages thereby reducing the need to hold on to costly inventory (Shirley and Winston, 2004, Li and Li, 2013, Datta, 2012). This is particularly relevant for developing countries where inventory levels are two to five times higher than in the United States (Guasch and Joseph, 2001). In India, Gulyani (2001) finds that the ‘total logistics cost’ of inadequate transportation infrastructure in the automotive sector is very high, while Datta (2012) estimates that being on the GQ highway reduces inventory holdings by at least six days’ worth of production. The combined effect of lower transportation costs and reduced inventory pile-up has a first order impact on manufacturing productivity. Asturias et al. (2018) document large welfare gains from GQ access due to higher allocative efficiency, labour income and average markups that affect state’s terms of trade.====Recent contributions have studied the effect of transportation infrastructure on long-term GDP (Banerjee et al., 2020), economic activity (Chandra and Thompson, 2000, Ghani et al., 2016a, Ghani et al., 2016a), bilateral trade between cities (Duranton et al., 2014, Faber, 2014), productivity and allocative efficiency (Fernald, 1999, Holl, 2016, Lall et al., 2004, Ghani et al., 2016a, Asturias et al., 2018), skill demand in local labour markets (Michaels, 2008), and urban form (Baum-Snow et al., 2017), among others. Our paper is closest to Ghani et al. (2016a) and Asturias et al. (2018) in that we study the effect of roads on manufacturing TFP in India. But, while these studies consider exclusively the economic effect of GQ highways that constitute less than 0.1% of India’s road network at the extensive margin, we focus on the intensive margin impact of India’s entire road transportation network. Furthermore, we document the importance of plant-level micro-structure and road type in affecting the relationship.====The gains from lower transportation costs are not evenly distributed across firms within industries. In fact, the recent literature points out the importance of firm micro-structure in determining how policy distortions affect aggregate productivity (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008, Bernard et al., 2012, Melitz, 2003). This means that a fall in transportation costs might result in higher productivity firms to thrive while lower productivity firms shrink or exit altogether. Moreover, when the dispersion of productivity across firms within industries is large, the effect of micro-heterogeneity in affecting aggregate productivity becomes even more salient. Syverson (2011) and Bartelsman et al. (2013), for instance, find enormous and persistent difference in productivity across firms even within narrowly defined industries. Yet, the role of plant-specific heterogeneity in affecting the relationship between falling transportation costs and productivity has received little attention. In contrast to the existing literature, we investigate how plant-specific heterogeneity in terms of size, age and location, affects the relationship between roads and TFP.====When trade barriers fall as a result of improvements in road transportation infrastructure, it reallocates inputs in favour of higher productivity firms. And, this within-industry reallocation affects aggregate productivity. Hsieh and Klenow (2009) notes that eliminating resource misallocation will significantly raise TFP in manufacturing by 86–115 per cent in China, 100–128 per cent in India and 30–43 per cent in the US. To assess the degree of misallocation, Bartelsman et al. (2013) points out that the within-industry covariance between firm size and productivity is a robust measure to examine the impact of misallocation. We therefore construct within-industry covariance between logged TFP and firm size and assess how road transportation infrastructure affects reallocation of resources across plants within the same industry.====Empirical identification of the economic effect of transportation infrastructure is challenging because of endogeneity. In the literature, identification often comes from instrumenting the existing transportation network with historical roads/ railway routes (Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2016, Donaldson, 2018, Duranton et al., 2014, Agrawal et al., 2017), the distance to straight lines connecting historical cities or terminal nodes (Banerjee et al., 2020, Ghani et al., 2016a, Asturias et al., 2018), or the construction of least cost path spanning tree network between bilateral pair of nodes (Faber, 2014). Others have used exogenous variation in oil prices interacted with city-pair distance directly in the regression (Storeygard, 2016), the duration of exposure of an administrative area to rural roads (Aggarwal, 2018) or, utilized the population threshold in targeting rural road building for identification (Asher and Novosad, 2020).==== In this paper, our instrumentation strategy relies on the political-economics of road building in a federal democracy. Specifically, we instrument sub-national road density with the strength of centre-state partisan alignment that asymmetrically stimulates road building in aligned states. Moreover, the fact that election cycles in India are staggered across groups of states helps our identification.====There are three main contributions of this study. First, we provide a political-economic basis for understanding the heterogeneity in the sub-national distribution of manufacturing productivity. The mechanism is quite simple: centre-state partisan politics encourages strategic road building in aligned states which, in turn, affects manufacturing productivity. The impact is sequential and we utilize this in our estimation by considering the impact of electoral outcomes that are lagged by about two years, on average, on road building and then estimate the impact of these roads on manufacturing TFP. The observed evidence validates the above mentioned mechanism in the context of India. This is important because the resulting distribution in economic activity is likely to be sub-optimal whenever the observed distribution deviates from an equilibrium based on economic efficiency alone.====Secondly, on the empirical side, we estimate TFP using plant-level panel data that enables us to control for fixed unobservable plant-specific heterogeneity. Previous studies examining the relationship between roads and TFP in India rely on repeated cross-section data that do not control for plant-specific heterogeneity and hence may be biased (see, for example, Ghani et al., 2016a). In contrast, we control for such heterogeneity and obtain estimates that are closer to the ‘true’ effect.====Finally, we provide causal estimates of the impact of roads on TFP at the intensive margin. This might be particularly relevant in the case of roads because of its interdependent structure. Furthermore, we highlight the role of plant-level heterogeneity and road type in affecting the relationship.====We organize this paper as follows: Section 2 provides essential background relating to the financing and management of road infrastructure in India. Section 3 introduces the dataset and discusses how we estimate TFP. Section 4 specifies a simple model that outlines the relationship between roads and TFP and presents our identification strategy. Section 5 presents the main regression results and its extensions, while Section 6 reports robustness checks.

To address it, we examine a recently promulgated transparency policy in China that mandates public access to ","In the internet age, authoritarian regimes have taken significant steps to increase the access that ordinary people have to government information.==== A growing body of research suggests these regimes resort to an open sharing of government information with their citizens to address the principal-agent problem in the bureaucracy (Liu, 2010; Tan, 2014; Stromseth et al., 2017). Transparency and the disclosure of government information improve public governance by enabling citizens participation and monitoring, reducing corruption (Shleifer and Vishny, 1993; Adserà et al., 2003; Stromseth et al., 2017), and increasing public trust and regime legitimacy (Stiglitz, 2002; Lorentzen, 2014).====However, it is also widely believed that authoritarian regimes are reluctant to fully commit to transparency because the disclosure of information could destabilize autocratic power. The costs of information disclosure are high when transparency reveals autocrats’ incompetence and incurs mass mobilization to challenge their rule (Hollyer et al., 2015). Moreover, while some autocrats or top leaders are willing to improve transparency, the bureaucrats that work under them have every reason to obscure information to avoid scrutiny and tend to manipulate information to increase their chance of promotion (e.g., Wallace, 2006 Tsai, 2008; Kung and Chen, 2011). Reforms intended to develop transparency are usually unlikely to materialize.====This article exploits a recent transparency initiative of the Chinese government, namely, the mandatory disclosure of judicial opinions, to examine whether the government's disclosure decisions are broadly consistent with improving public governance or are mere window dressing. We use court cases involving publicly listed firms for the purpose of our analysis because this makes it possible to identify the undisclosed cases by using a benchmark sample for all cases, gathered from the firms’ own public disclosures, as required and enforced by China's securities regulations. Identifying undisclosed court cases enables us to estimate the completeness of court disclosure; it also makes it possible to investigate judicial favoritism in the disclosure process and estimate the economic impact that the release of judicial decisions can bring to the firms. By studying how courts disclose or suppress judicial opinions, we seek to understand the underlying motives that an authoritarian government may have for improving transparency.====Since January 1, 2014, courts in China have been required to post their opinions online. This requirement granted public access to over 40 million judicial decisions by the end of 2017, with the earliest cases going back to 2008. We match this sample with a comprehensive set (==== = 5370 from 2008 to 2016) of the court cases of publicly listed firms that we collected from firms’ disclosures, which are published as mandated by securities regulations. We find that courts disclosed only 37.14% of all cases in our set. This indicates that the majority of cases are suppressed, despite the judicial disclosure requirement.====We find that courts’ decisions to disclose or suppress cases are influenced by local and political incentives. Suppression of judicial opinions is stronger for cases involving state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and for firms that were defendants in their home courts (i.e., courts located in the same province as the firm headquarters). This is consistent with a strategy of local governments to work to protect SOEs and home firms (Firth et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2015), who are important for local economic growth and social stability and thereby for local politicians’ career advancement (Li and Zhou, 2005; Piotroski and Zhang, 2014; Piotroski et al., 2015). The public disclosure of judicial opinions may draw unfavorable attention to these firms and prevent government leaders from treating them favorably.====Second, disclosure bias is associated with local political actors’ promotion incentives. We find that courts are less likely to disclose cases involving SOEs and home firms in the year prior to the promotion of a provincial party secretary than in other years. The underlying logic is similar to the findings in past literature that feature a relationship between local politicians’ incentives and their manipulation of local information. For example, in the year prior to the promotion of provincial political leaders, publicly listed firms tend to suppress the release of negative information to the market to avoid risking local politicians’ chances of advancing in the government (Piotroski et al., 2015). During the famine associated with the Great Leap Forward, provincial leaders with stronger incentives for career advancement were more likely to fabricate agricultural procurement data, leading to higher rates of mortality in their provinces (Kung and Chen, 2011).====Third, because transparency reform enables the central government to exercise control over local courts, the courts are also subject to opposing political forces, which act in favor of greater disclosure and transparency. Some presidents of provincial high courts have had work experience with the Supreme People's Court (SPC) and are the beneficiaries of direct appointments to local positions. We find that courts whose presidents have SPC work experience implement the centralized transparency policy more effectively; specifically, the bias in disclosure is less severe in their provinces.====Our evidence also indicates the economic consequences of disclosure for the firms. We find statistically significant and negative 10-day cumulative abnormal returns at 0.64% on the day of and days subsequent to the posting of judicial opinions and at 2.01% when we track the cumulative abnormal returns over a 30-day period. In addition, we find that even after controlling for firms’ financial characteristics, firms whose cases are disclosed experience a significant drop in debt and equity financing relative to those whose litigation is not disclosed in the court opinions.====Disclosure decisions and the negative economic consequences to firms after court disclosures together suggest that local courts making judicial opinion disclosure decisions based on private and political incentives. Our results suggest not only that many Chinese firms receive unfair treatment in the judicial process (Firth et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2015) but that the disclosure of courts’ opinions ==== entails judicial biases, which is the opposite of what the government sought in its transparency initiative. Notably, from our fieldwork, we recognize that the SPC already has all local judicial decisions stored in its internal database. Thus, the central government should be able to detect disclosure bias if it chose. Our results suggest that the central government did not pressure local courts to fully comply with disclosure policy, probably because pressuring local governments to comply might lead to conflicts with local politicians or limit the government's ability to influence SOEs, which would incur political and economic costs that outweigh the benefits of enhancing judicial fairness. These findings are consistent with past studies suggesting that local courts can be an arena for both symbiotic cooperation and power struggles between the central and local governments (He, 2013; Ng and He, 2017). In practice, the SPC does not command unquestioned allegiance from its lower courts. The extent of its actual control varies socio-politically.====Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. Taking China's attempt to employ transparency to improve public governance as a case study, our article extends the economics literature on the quality of governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1993;La Porta et al., 1999;Treisman, 2000; Adserà et al., 2003). Against the conventional wisdom, authoritarian regimes do tend to adopt a variety of democratic institutions in their governance: many permit public protests and online complaints, and some allow media freedom and free speech. As assessed by a growing body of political science research, these institutions are designed to strengthen a regime's ability to monitor and control the actions of lower-tier officials by bringing public scrutiny on them (Egorov et al., 2009; King et al., 2013; Lorentzen, 2013, Lorentzen, 2014; Chen and Xu, 2017; Anderson et al., 2019). Extending this line of research, we provide evidence that transparency in authoritarian regimes is likely to be incomplete; more importantly, it can be highly selective and distorted, driven by potentially conflicting political incentives of different government agencies. In fact, information distortion and manipulation plague autocracies (Tsai, 2008; Wallace, 2016; Jiang and Wallace, 2017; Pan and Chen, 2018), making transparency unlikely to succeed as a tool to improve accountability.====Previous study of government transparency has encountered difficulty in obtaining sufficient disclosure information to conduct large-sample studies. Even if data on disclosure are available, finding the right benchmark for measuring disclosure quality can be challenging, because if information that should be disclosed is suppressed, the suppression is not usually visible to the public. Another challenge is the difficulty in differentiating nondisclosure caused by a regime's capacity constraints in generating data from the intentional suppression of information (Hollyer et al., 2015). We overcome these challenges with the use of a unique setting: disparity in disclosure by the courts and firm disclosure enforced through securities regulations.====It is also worth mentioning that past studies have centered on the ways in which information manipulation occurs but have paid scant attention to its consequences. Our study, by contrast, estimates the impact of information manipulation. Our findings suggest that the disclosure or suppression of government information itself carries meaningful signals regarding government attitudes and can impose costs on market actors. These results complement existing work on censorship and information manipulation in authoritarian regimes.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In this paper, we answer the following questions: do current expenditures and public investment react differently to the business cycle? If so, why? In a sample of more than 100 developing countries and 30 developed countries observed between 1980 and 2014, a new empirical regularity specific to developing countries is identified: upswings are associated with increases in current primary expenditures only, while public investment falls and current spending remains acyclical during downturns. Evidence is also presented that this asymmetrical response is more pronounced in countries where incumbent politicians face shorter time horizons and weak institutions. Other types of determinants traditionally discussed in the literature have limited explanatory power.","There is a large theoretical and empirical literature documenting the procyclicality of fiscal policy in developing countries. At the theoretical level scholars have identified economic determinants such as imperfect access to credit markets (Gavin and Perotti, 1997), and political distortions that tend to generate a procyclical bias in fiscal policy (Alesina, Campante and Tabellini, 2008; Tornell and Lane, 1999). Empirically, the literature has moved forward in documenting procyclicality in different dimensions of fiscal policy, including fiscal balances and total expenditures (Kaminsky, Reinhart and Végh, 2004; Gavin and Perotti, 1997), tax rates (Végh and Vuletin, 2015), as well as addressing endogeneity concerns regarding the relationship between fiscal responses and economic growth (Ilzetzki and Végh, 2008; Jaimovich and Panizza, 2007; Rigobón, 2004).====In spite of these advances, much less is known about the cyclical behavior of key components of public expenditure (such as consumption vs. investment), and the distinction between good and bad times has often been overlooked in this literature. Identifying asymmetrical public spending responses has important policy implications: if certain expenditure items increase in good times but do not fall in bad times, such asymmetries could undermine fiscal sustainability (Balassone and Kumar, 2007) and may also help explain biases in the composition of public spending, in which certain spending categories lose ground relative to others (Izquierdo et al., 2018). Since public spending items are associated with diverse fiscal multipliers (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2013; Riera-Crichton, Végh and Vuletin, 2015; Ilzetzki, Mendoza and Végh, 2013) and redistributive features (Lustig, 2017; Goñi, López and Servén, 2011), understanding whether procyclicality is rooted in one or another budget category can provide insights to important policy debates about the macroeconomic and distributive effects of fiscal policy.====While from an economic standpoint it would be advisable to keep certain expenditure categories either countercyclical or at least, acyclical, political conditions and incentives may distort optimal policy decisions. A first best scenario likely calls for current expenditure to remain acyclical (except for automatic stabilizers such as unemployment insurance), growing at the rate of trend GDP, while capital expenditure and automatic stabilizers work countercyclically. However, as argued by an important political economy tradition, ==== may prove too weak to prevent special interests from exploiting the budget common pool during good times (Talvi and Végh, 2005; Tornell and Lane 1999; Velasco, 1997). In addition, ==== of those in charge of implementing fiscal policy over different budget components may vary, affecting incumbents’ choices of which policy instruments to protect or expand during different phases of the cycle. For example, due to their different production technology, public spending components vary in their degree of ==== to voters, and hence, affect an incumbent's political payoffs differently (Rogoff, 1990). While consumption spending provides immediate payoffs, the benefits of public investment infrastructure often take more time to materialize. In the presence of short political time horizons, the temptation to bias such choice toward visible spending categories may prove irresistible. Moreover, in times of economic adjustment, capital expenditure cuts may prove to be more politically palatable than cuts in current expenditure, as the costs of cutting investment are harder for voters to perceive in bad times.====In this paper, we study the cyclical properties of two important expenditure categories (current expenditures and public investment) during the different phases of the business cycle to answer the following questions: what type of expenditures expand during upswings, what gets adjusted during downturns, by how much, and why? In a sample of more than 100 developing and emerging economies and 30 advanced countries observed between 1980 and 2014, we identify a new empirical regularity specific to developing countries: upswings are associated with increases in current primary expenditures (e.g., wages, transfers) only, while public investment falls and current spending remains acyclical during downturns. We show that such fiscal asymmetrical response is consistent with a political economy argument: incumbent politicians have stronger incentives to increase (decrease) current (capital) spending in good (bad) times in the presence of short political time horizons, and weak institutions provide the necessary means to achieve this policy equilibrium. Other types of factors traditionally discussed in the literature (limited creditworthiness, budget institutions, and tax base volatility) have limited explanatory power.====Our paper contributes to the literature on fiscal policy cyclicality in two main ways. First, we identify a new empirical regularity regarding the asymmetrical behavior of two major budget categories (current and public investment spending) for a large sample of emerging and developing economies. While fiscal asymmetry in developing countries has been studied in the past, extant studies have concentrated on either aggregate level expenditures (Carneiro and Garrido, 2015; Balassone and Kumar, 2007) or specific social spending such as education and health (Arze del Granado, Gupta and Hadjdenberg, 2013). Previous research that has looked at the cyclical behavior of current/capital spending has not addressed whether procyclicality originates specifically in good or bad times (Akitoby et al., 2006), or has done so for only a subset of economies (oil-exporting countries) in the context of the study of exchange rate dynamics(Arezki and Ismail, 2013) .====While traditional explanations of procyclicality are a good starting point to uncover the reasons why policymakers pursue procyclical fiscal policies in general, they cannot fully account for the ==== of the fiscal asymmetry in particular: that is, a policy pattern in which public investment gets adjusted during bad times, and current spending is boosted during good times. For example, imperfect access to international credit markets during bad times may leave governments with no choice but to cut spending, but it remains unclear which specific budget categories should bear the brunt of fiscal adjustment. To the extent that the multiplier of capital expenditure is larger than that of current expenditure, it may be beneficial to protect or expand public investment to sustain aggregate demand (Abiad et al. 2016), especially under circumstances that are common in developing countries (Izquierdo et al. 2019). Moreover, while weak institutions should facilitate interest group lobbying that would push public expenditures upwards during good times, there is no clear-cut answer about which components are subject to such procyclical pressures. Thus, our second contribution is to test a political economy mechanism that could account for the results we observe.====We put forward the hypothesis that political time horizons are an important determinant of fiscal asymmetrical behavior. Politicians facing shorter time horizons are more likely to engage in asymmetric fiscal behavior, because of the variation in political payoffs associated with each spending component. Vis-à-vis current expenditures, the costs of cutting investment are harder for voters to perceive in bad times; and vis-à-vis capital spending, the benefits of providing current expenditures in good times are more immediate (Rogoff, 1990). By focusing on policymaker's incentives in relation to their time or planning horizons, we contribute to the literature emphasizing the intertemporal dimension of fiscal policy (Tabellini and Alesina, 1990); Besley and Case, 1995 and 2003; Crain and Oakley, 1995; Nogare and Ricciuti, 2011).====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews previous contributions on the political economy of procyclical spending, highlights key limitations, and briefly develops a new political mechanism that could account for asymmetrical fiscal responses. Section 3 presents the data and empirical strategy, and Section 4 presents stylized facts regarding fiscal asymmetry in developing countries and contrasting evidence among advanced economies. Section 5 traces the determinants of asymmetrical fiscal behavior, including the role of political time horizons. Section 6 goes a step further by testing the argument against plausible alternative explanations, and adds a number of robustness checks.

This paper estimates a border effect on increasing barriers for firms located outside of a new external EU border following the 2004 and 2007 EU enlargement. In a repeated cross-section of three flows of EBRD-World Bank survey data, the study encompasses 23 border regions in 10 countries, four of which bordered new EU/Schengen countries. Taking border transformations as exogenous changes to firms’ environments, and focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises near borders, the results indicate that five years after enlargement, firms in non-EU member states near a new external EU border experienced a fall in sales of 40% and exports of 70% relative to firms near borders that did not change. Firms on the EU side of the same border experienced no such negative effect. Ten years after enlargement, the negative effects effectively disappeared.","In 2004, eight countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) joined the European Union (EU); three more would follow in 2007 and 2013. At the same time, a new set of six CEE countries found themselves ‘stuck’ outside the EU Single Market, bordering the new EU member states. From their point of view and depending on prior economic relations with their new EU neighbour, the newly transformed borders could have increased the cost of trade to their direct neighbours.====In this paper I aim to estimate the effect of EU enlargement on sales and exports of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in regions located in non-EU member states but in the proximity of a newly external EU border.==== The countries affected this way were Croatia (an EU member state since 2013), Serbia (an EU member state candidate since 2012), North Macedonia (an EU member state candidate since 2020) and Ukraine, each sharing multiple borders with new EU member states.==== SMEs are responsible for 60% to 75% of total employment in most countries including those in CEE (OECD, n.d.), but tend to be disproportionally affected by international borders (OECD, 2008).====I use a repeated cross-section of firms from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and associate these firms to their nearest borders. The surveys refer to the years 2004, 2008 and 2012. I combine this data with information on border transformations following EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007. During this period, 14 borders transformed from common international borders to external EU borders (e.g. Slovenia and Hungary with Croatia) in CEE.==== Using data of individual firms located around 10 of these borders allows me to compare average sales and export performance between survey waves.====The results indicate that firms near transformed borders have on average at least 40% less sales and 70% lower exports relative to firms in the same country near an untransformed border. The non-exporting firms in the same border regions are similarly negatively affected in their sales, suggesting a wider economic spill-over. Comparisons with firms in the interior further support this main finding. Using the third survey wave to gauge the longer-term effect of 8 years since the EU enlargement, I find that this initial negative effect has disappeared or even reversed.====Where borders represent administrative barriers (e.g. customs and passport checks), their removal is expected to have positive economic effects through lower trade barriers and increased market-access (Fujita et al., 2001). Empirical studies have estimated such border effects over time and space, from McCallum (1995), focusing on the US-Canada border, to Felbermayr et al. (2018) who aim to disentangle the bilateral trade effects of EU membership, the European Monetary Union, the European customs union and Schengen.==== These studies concentrate on bilateral country-level trade relations, occasionally differentiated by sector. In contrast, this article focuses on individual firms in specific sub-national regions. Moreover, due to data availability, these studies do not always include bilateral trade data of all new EU member states or non-member states. Studies that use firm-level data to study the effects of borders are often limited to a single country (Berthou and Fontagné, 2013, Iacovone and Javorcik, 2010).====The survey data used in this article are consistently sampled and collected in many countries which increases the external validity of this study. Moreover, the BEEPS dataset includes firm-level data for all CEE countries, in contrast to studies that use data on European NUTS-regions that are limited to EU member states (e.g. Brülhart et al., 2004, Brakman et al., 2012). Braakmann and Vogel, 2011, Braakmann and Vogel, 2010) estimate the performance of German firms near the Polish and Czech borders around the 2004 EU enlargement using panel data from 2003 to 2005. They find that larger firms have lower sales and export intensity following the enlargement, while small firms have higher sales.====Borders often represent differences in cultures and knowledge networks. Therefore, the removal or addition of administrative hurdles may not have immediate economic effects (Head and Mayer, 2013). For instance, the border between East and West Germany continues to have a noticeable effect on cities’ development and within-country trade flows even after German unification (Buettner and Rincke, 2007, Nitsch and Wolf, 2013, Redding and Sturm, 2008, Zierahn, 2012). Similarly, the ‘removal’ of the Iron Curtain had only limited repercussions on towns and labour markets in bordering regions, despite the large differences in wealth and wages across borders (Brülhart et al., 2018, Brülhart et al., 2012, Moritz and Gröger, 2007). Heider (2019) and Wassmann (2016) find very small effects on towns and regions in old member states near borders with new member states around the 2004 EU enlargement. These studies principally focused on the effect of enlargement from the perspective of the EU-15, the ‘old’ member states. Besides data availability, research from the EU-15 perspective reflected concerns that the new low-wage countries might pose a risk to the old member states’ economies and workers (European Commission, 2001, Jacoby, 2010).====What is neglected, however, is the effect that the entry of the new member states has had on their border regions ==== the effect that enlargement has had on border regions in those countries that remained outside the EU, but who became neighbours to an EU member. The latter is the focus of this paper. The enlargement of the EU meant that the external EU border, and later the external Schengen border, expanded east-wards. Countries that may have had strong trade links with their neighbours before 2004 suddenly saw their border transform from a common international border to an external-EU border, and with this potentially stricter controls on goods and people (Davis and Gift, 2014).==== Moreover, the previously cited empirical studies on transformed borders focus predominantly on regional economies and/or towns. While the impact on regional economies is useful, it remains unclear what exactly caused the economic effects. The performance of firms is one crucial channel to understand regional economic performance.====Policy makers acknowledged the possibility of negative effects for non-EU members when one or more of their neighbours joined the EU. Dangerfield (2006) writes about the efforts of non-acceding candidates, in particular Croatia, to safeguard market access to the new member states.==== Moreover, border regions often demonstrate weaker economic growth and lower wages and/or employment levels relative to non-border regions (European Commission, 2001). Border transformations and their economic effects continue to be important issues. Migration from outside the EU led to challenges for the open borders in the Schengen area. EU enlargement to the Western Balkans could lead to new external EU borders in the region. A new external EU land border on the island of Ireland remains one of the most salient issues following Brexit.",Stuck outside the single market; Evidence from firms in central and eastern Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596721000469,12 August 2021,2021,Research Article,91.0

Our results provide robust evidence to assert that debt relief, in combination with other financing sources, can contribute to improving educational outcomes in highly indebted poor countries.","Over the past decade, low-income countries (LICs), have experienced a significant increase in their level of public debt. A recent World Bank report draws attention to the increasing reliance of governments in LICs on private creditors as a major threat to the sustainability of their public debt (World Bank, 2020).====The loan volumes, conditions and interest rates charged by private creditors tend to be higher than those of international financial institutions (IFIs) (Boz, 2011), which in turn can contribute to increasing debt servicing, and ultimately lead to public resources being channelled to debt repayment rather than to economic and social development programs. In the area of education, for instance, despite significant improvements in primary school attendance rates since the World Declaration on Education for All in 1990, and the subsequent adoption of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 (Niño Zarazúa, 2016, Riddell and Niño Zarazúa, 2016), estimates indicate that about 258 million children aged 6 to 17 were still out of school in 2018 (UNESCO, 2019). Thus, unfavourable borrowing conditions raise concerns about the feasibility of achieving the sustainable development goals.====This study investigates whether debt relief initiatives can be a credible alternative for development financing, especially in the current context of debt-distressed LICs. Although debt relief initiatives are now more than twenty years old and their effects on recipient countries’ development have been extensively studied, there is still little evidence on the role that such initiatives might have played in advancing educational outcomes. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the effects of debt relief initiatives on primary school attendance. We exploit the original context of the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) to adopt a multi-level empirical approach, combining children-level and country-level data from 177 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for 44 countries (both HIPCs and non-HIPCs) between 1990 and 2015, covering more than 1.5 million children eligible to attend primary education. The time covered in this study is much longer than in previous studies, allowing us to study both short- and long-term effects of debt relief on school attendance.====The empirical strategy relies on a difference-in-differences (DiD) model where “treated” individuals are school-age children living in HIPC during the post-debt relief period, while the “control” group is made up of either school-age children living in the same country before debt relief was granted, or school-age children living in a country which did not benefit from the Enhanced HIPC (and hence MDRI) initiatives. Consequently, while the dependent variable is observed at the child level, the variable of interest – exposure to the Enhanced HIPC initiative – is observed at the cohort (year of birth)-country-survey year level. The inclusion of country, cohort and survey-year fixed effects allows us to observe the relationship between debt relief initiatives and the likelihood of attending primary school, keeping age-cohort, country and survey-year characteristics constant, compared to trends in primary school attendance in control countries. In addition, time-varying controls both at the micro and macro levels allow us to control for the effects of children’s characteristics as well as trends in aggregate determinants of primary school attendance among LICs.====Results show that school-age children at the time their countries participated in debt relief initiatives had a higher probability, of around 10 percentage points, of attending primary school. These results are robust to multiple robustness tests such as the introduction of a large number of additional controls and the implementation of spatial difference-in-discontinuity estimators. In investigating the potential mechanisms, we find that debt relief initiatives improved school attendance partly because they led to an increase in public expenditure in education and because they freeded up resources (fiscal space), which in turn were spent on education. We find that the strength of the relationship is mostly driven by debt relief granted under the Enhanced HIPC initiative, which highlights the potential contribution of conditionalities attached to this program. Furthermore, we also find that the magnitude of the debt relief contribution depends on the amount of debt cancellation as well as on the country’s debtor history.====Since within-country disparities in education persist in many countries, we use the micro dimension of the data to investigate whether debt relief initiatives have contributed to reducing educational inequalities. Thus, our study contributes to a growing literature that examines inequalities in education in terms of gender, wealth, household structure, religion, ethnicity and spatial characteristics. Results show that debt relief helped reduce wealth-based and intergenerational inequalities in education by affecting more children from poor and uneducated households. Debt relief also disproportionately affected children from ethnic and religious minority groups as well as those with non-Christian religious background, thus contributing to reducing educational inequalities based on ethnicity and religion. Finally, debt relief reduced spatial educational disparities by affecting more children residing in rural and remote areas.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the two debt relief initiatives examined in this study, and their expected effects on education. Section 3 describes the data and the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the main results, multiple robustness tests, and the potential mechanisms at play.

Using a new methodology and data from 47 countries covering the period 1995–2018, we show that higher compositional inequality is associated with higher inter-personal inequality. This is clearly shown by Latin American countries and India. Nordic countries are exceptional because they combine high compositional inequality with low inter-personal inequality. Their exceptionalism is attenuated when pension income received from largely government-mandated accumulated savings is added to capital income. The analysis shows the theoretical possibility of societies where low compositional inequality may be combined with high income inequality. Currently, China and the United States come closest to that position.","The way capital and labor incomes are distributed across the population conveys information on systemic features of modern societies. Two particular distributions are especially relevant.====In the first distribution, one group of people earns only incomes from ownership (capital), and another group earns incomes only from work (labor). These two groups of people may not be overlapping in terms of total income. All members, or most members, of the former group (capital-owners) may be richer than any member of the latter group (workers). We label this society “classical capitalism”. It is a picture of a society implicit in the works of classical political economy, from Adam Smith to Ricardo and Marx. At the extreme, classical capitalism is a society where the rich earn only capital incomes, and the rest earn only labor incomes. In such a society, the type of income one receives determines also one's position in income distribution.====The second distribution describes, instead, a society in which individuals receive incomes both from capital and labor. In the extreme version of such a society, shares of income from capital and labor are equal for all members, and thus type of income and position in income distribution are orthogonal. In the sense of factoral income composition such a society is “classless”. A society of equal factoral composition need not be a society of equal incomes. It is theoretically possible that such a society has high income inequality. Thus, compositional and inter-personal inequality can, theoretically, be unrelated.====Development of this classification (with classical capitalism at one end of the spectrum, and society of compositional equality at the other) is the first objective of the paper. The following questions are therefore addressed: Can we identify today's societies that are close to classical capitalism, and do they display high income inequality? Are there societies of relatively equal compositional structure, and do they tend to have low or high inter-personal inequality? Our approach to the varieties of capitalist systems is different from those put forward by Hall and Soskice (2001) and Amable (2003), since it fully relies on empirically-observed distributional characteristics of the economies and covers much more than Western countries.====The second objective of our paper is to address in a new way the old problem of the relationship between the functional and personal income distributions. The origins of the work on income inequality go back to functional inequality, that is, to the share of total net income received by the three (land, labor and capital) and later two (capital and labor) factors of production. Studies of inter-personal inequality have however almost entirely developed without much reference to, or interaction with, functional inequality.Atkinson (1997), Atkinson, (2009) tried to provide a framework to integrate these two distributions. Our paper shows one way in which that integration can be accomplished.====With the rising capital share during the past thirty years, both in advanced and emerging economies (Atkinson and Piketty 2010; Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014; Dao et al., 2019; Bengtsson and Waldenström, 2018; Roine and Waldenström 2015), the relationship between the two distributions has gained in practical relevance, as argued, among others, by Piketty (2014). If earnings from capital are mostly “located” at the top of the income distribution, then the rising capital share will almost automatically be translated into higher interpersonal inequality. This is the case with systems such as classical capitalism, in which the dynamics of the functional income distribution proxies relatively well that of inter-personal income inequality.====Differently, a system where capital and labor shares are broadly equal for most individuals makes inter-personal income distribution “insulated” from factorial income changes. The share of capital income that some authors expect to further increase with automation, for instance, can go up without affecting at all inequality of personal incomes. Since everyone derives about the same percentage of their income from capital, an increase in the capital share raises everybody's income by the same proportion, and leaves standard (relative) measures of inequality the same.====To address these two objectives, the paper empirically investigates the relationship between inequality in the composition of income and level of inter-personal income inequality. While income inequality is commonly measured by standard statistics as the Gini coefficient, mapping compositional income inequality requires a different methodology. To do so, we use a new statistic, the ==== (IFC) index, defined and developed in Ranaldi (2021).====The IFC index is based on the following idea. If we decompose total income into two factors, such as capital and labor income, then income composition inequality is the extent to which the shares of the two income sources within each individual's income vary along the total income distribution. If all individuals have the same shares of capital and labor in their total income (regardless of the amount of total income), compositional inequality will be minimal. It will be at the maximum when individuals at the top and at the bottom of the total income distribution earn two different types of income. Therefore, under a high level of compositional inequality a society can be seen as close to classical capitalism, whereas under a low level of compositional inequality it can be seen as close to a classless society.====In today's societies that are characterized by capital income being still overwhelmingly received by the rich, we show that the two recently observed changes, namely rising capital income share and increasing concentration of capital income, will both tend to increase the IFC index (the latter unambiguously, the former most likely) while also, as we know from earlier analytical work, driving Gini up. This expected similar movement in IFC index and in Gini, responding to the underlying changes in income distribution, informs our cross-sectional analysis too. While the conclusions regarding the effects of rising capital share and rising capital concentration on IFC and Gini are valid for a given country over time, we would still expect to find a broad positively-sloped alignment of countries according to their IFCs and Ginis. When we do not, as in some cases we shall not, this by itself will highlight specific country features.====We study this empirically using a broad geographical coverage. We include 21 developed economies from Western Europe, North America and Oceania, 10 countries from Latin America, 11 from Eastern Europe, and 5 from Asia, including China and India. The total included population, calculated at the most recent year when a country is included in the database, is almost 4.4 billion.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework, in which we define IFC, introduce a novel expression for the Gini coefficient and establish the relationship between compositional inequality (IFC) and inter-personal inequality (Gini). Section 3 gives the main results. Section 4 discusses a political economy interpretation of the main findings.

From 1775–1919, these villages were arbitrarily assigned to opposite sides of the Austrian and Ottoman/Russian border despite being located seven kilometers apart. This plausibly exogenous border assignment affected local institutions and late-18th century migration in a manner that likely also affected trust. Conditional on trust norms being affected by these centuries-old historical circumstances, our experimental design tests the degree to which such norms are transmitted intergenerationally. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that participants on the Austrian side that also have family roots in the village are indeed more likely to trust outsiders.","Although it may seem obvious to a casual observer that ”culture matters” for economic and political decision-making, it is not so obvious how it matters. How do we distinguish between cultural stimuli and economic, political, or institutional stimuli? To what degree do these stimuli feed into each other? Indeed, how do we even begin to quantify culture? The difficulty in providing satisfactory answers to these questions long dissuaded social scientists from investigating the connection between culture and political/economic outcomes, eschewing it as either untestable or unimportant.====However, culture has received a much revived interest from social scientists in the last two decades. While the term ”culture” can mean many things, this literature generally conceptualizes culture as distinct from economic and institutional stimuli by defining it as the heuristics employed by people within a society to interpret the complex world around them (Boyd and Richerson, 1985, Henrich, 2001, Wedeen, 2002, Giuliano and Nunn, 2021, Greif and Mokyr, 2017).==== Within economics and political science, the causes and consequences of ==== have received special attention. Trust is crucial to economic and political development (Arrow, 1972, Putnam et al., 1994, Whiteley, 2000, Uslaner and Brown, 2005, Tabellini, 2010, Algan and Cahuc, 2010, Algan and Cahuc, 2014, Butler et al., 2016), and those heuristics that people use to determine whether or not to trust others and under which conditions to trust others clearly differ by society (Henrich, 2001). There are also practical reasons social scientists have recently focused on trust: there are numerous measures of trust collected in survey data (Fisman and Khanna, 1999, Alesina and La Ferrara, 2002, Zak and Knack, 2001, Bahry et al., 2005, Hooghe et al., 2009, Aghion et al., 2010, Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011, Grosjean, 2011b, Kasara, 2013, Grosfeld and Zhuravskaya, 2015, Becker et al., 2016); and trust experiments are among the most widely used in experimental studies, both in the lab and in the field (Berg et al., 1995, Croson and Buchan, 1999, Glaeser et al., 2000, Fershtman and Gneezy, 2001, Buchan et al., 2002, Fehr et al., 2003, Barr, 2003, Karlan, 2005, Johnson and Mislin, 2011, Sapienza et al., 2013, Robinson, 2016).====The most difficult issue the literature faces is one of identification: how do we know when a determinant is ”culture” and when it is some (potentially unobservable or institutional) variable related to culture? Convincing identification strategies used to separate cultural determinants from other economic, political, sociological, or institutional determinants have included instrumental variables (Uslaner and Brown, 2005, Tabellini, 2010, Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011), regression discontinuity (Grosfeld et al., 2013, Grosfeld and Zhuravskaya, 2015, Becker et al., 2016, Buggle, 2016, Dupraz, 2019), and laboratory or field experiments (Fershtman and Gneezy, 2001, Cassar et al., 2014, Adida et al., 2016, Butler et al., 2016, Bigoni et al., 2016, Robinson, 2016, Lowes et al., 2017, Jeon et al., 2017, Walker, 2020).==== While such techniques are often useful, they are not always possible to use in a manner that yields insight into cultural and historical processes.====A recent literature, to which this paper adds, provides a novel method of testing for cultural persistence in such settings: ==== a ”lab in the field” experiment with a natural experiment (Lowes et al., 2017, Chaudhary et al., 2020, Walker, 2020).==== The idea is straight-forward: if one can find a natural experiment in which a historical border was ==== drawn, even if over a small expanse, ==== there is reason to believe that there are historical circumstances on either side of the border affecting culture, one can more finely pinpoint the degree to which cultural differences persisted by running laboratory experiments on subjects on either side of the border. The primary challenges of such an undertaking are: (i) finding an arbitrarily drawn border (most long borders are not arbitrary); (ii) finding a border in which there is reason to believe there were cultural differences associated with the border; and (iii) isolating the border effects from other (economic and non-economic) determinants which may also be different on either side of the border.====We address these challenges by running trust games on either side of an old Austrian (Habsburg) border in the Udeşti Commune located in northeastern Romania. This commune provides an ideal setting for testing the role that historically-generated cultural differences played in generating modern-day trust behavior for four reasons. First, a ”natural experiment” occurred within the commune after it was annexed by the Austrians following the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774, in which the Ottomans ceded the Bukovina region of Moldavia to the Austrians (see Fig. 1). One of the villages in the commune, Ştirbăt, was left on the Ottoman side despite there being a more natural river border to the north of Ştirbăt (see Fig. 2). Historical records, which we document in Section 2, indicate that this decision was due in large part to the idiosyncratic predilections of one landowner in Ştirbăt, not some economic or geographical calculus. This ”natural experiment” therefore satisfies the ====. The historical record suggests that this border was not created by economic, military, or even geographical considerations, but was the result of the idiosyncratic desires of one individual over two centuries ago.==== Second, there were two important economic differences created by the border. The first was institutional: Ottoman and Russian rule over Moldavia was unpredictable and prone to corruption by elites. While Austrian rule was hardly corruption-free, the Austrian government attempted to limit corruption by training local elites in Vienna and bringing them into the greater administrative structure. Second, evidence overviewed in Section 2 suggests there was selective migration into (non-Austrian) Ştirbăt in the late-18th century. The first settlers were either forced to settle (as part of Madame Ştirbeţ’s corvée) or migrated due to dislike of their new Austrian overlords. This migration primarily occurred in the late-18th century, not since (meaning that recent migration is unlikely to be a confounding factor). Importantly, ==== of these phenomena – institutional differences and selective migration – could have facilitated a culture of relative ”mistrust of outsiders” (and, conversely, trust of covillagers) in the late 18th and 19th centuries. To be clear, to the extent that this culture was in fact established, it would have done so by at latest the 19th century. Hence, our experiment is capable of testing whether people from villages that experienced Austrian rule over a century ago (as opposed to Ottoman rule, which had existed in the region since the 15th century) trust outsiders more than those that did not, although we cannot speak to which historical mechanism (institutions or migration) is more salient. The historical border therefore satisfies the ====. There is reason to believe that cultural differences were ==== historical events on either side of the border.====Third, the commune was reunified in 1919, meaning that for over a century the commune has shared common governance, fiscal institutions, communist legacies, and many other features one might expect would affect contemporary trust (Udişteanu, 2005 ch. 1). The natural experiment therefore satisfies the ====. Post-World War I economic and political events cannot explain differences between the villages, since they have been subject to the same forces for nearly a century. While it is likely true that political and economic differences persist ==== on either side of the old Austrian–Ottoman border, one of the advantages of our methodology is that the three villages under study are small enough that any such differences would have been unlikely to survive the Communist period, in which the villages were placed under the same communal leadership. Hence, if differences in trust across villages are found, cultural differences associated with the historical border are a plausible root cause.====Finally, our experiment allows us to parse whether those whose families have lived in the villages for multiple generations – and were thus presumably more imbued with the culture of their ancestors – exhibit different trust behavior than those who are relative newcomers. Ancestral information was obtained in a post-experiment survey. Should such differences arise, they would provide further evidence that the inter-generational transmission of culture underlies our results rather than some unobserved differences between the villages.====The experimental design entails playing trust games in two villages on the Austrian side of the border (Udeşti and Poieni)==== and one on the Ottoman/Russian (hence, non-Austrian) side (Ştirbăt). Fig. 2 depicts just how close these villages are to each other; each is within walking distance of the other two villages. Ideally we would have run trust games in a second village on the non-Austrian side, but Ştirbăt is the only village in the commune that satisfies this criterion. Participants in all villages played trust games with both co-villagers and people from one of the other villages (hence, outsiders).==== We compare actions of those whose villages experienced Austrian institutions (Udeşti and Poieni) with those whose village did not (Ştirbăt). We also analyze actions between the two Austrian villages, under the hypothesis that there should be no differences, on average, in actions between the two.====Our findings support the conjecture that historically-induced culture affects contemporary trust and that inter-generational transmission is a plausible mechanism. First, we find that participants on the Austrian side of the border have greater trust of subjects from outside their village (i.e., they send more tokens). Meanwhile, no (significant) differences in trust behavior are found between the two Austrian villages. Second, we find that these inter-village differences in trust of outsiders ==== arise for subjects whose grandparents are from the village in question. We interpret this result as evidence of an inter-generational transmission mechanism. It is only those subjects whose families experienced the institutional differences of 1774–1919 – or, at the very least, subjects whose grandparents grew up with people that experienced these differences – that showed differences in trust of outsiders. Third, we find that participants on the non-Austrian side (Ştirbăt) are more trusting of co-villagers ==== outsiders.====Our findings are consistent with three recent papers that use a similar ”lab in the field on a natural experiment” technique to identify cultural persistence. Lowes et al. (2017) employ a rule-following experiment to analyze the persistence of institutions established by the 17th-century Kuba Kingdom of central Africa. As in our experiment, Lowes et al. (2017) look at a culturally homogeneous group that happened to live on opposite sides of a political border whose boundaries were arbitrarily formed. They find that descendants of the Kuba, which had more developed institutions in the past, give 3%–7% less in ultimatum games and are much more likely to take money not allotted to them (2%–5% of the endowment). Lowes et al. (2017) reason that formal institutions supporting pro-social behavior substitute for the inculcation of norms supporting rule-following behavior. Our findings have a similar flavor: those who lived in a region with weaker formal institutions (the non-Austrian side) are relatively ==== of co-villagers, although they are less trusting of outsiders. Among those with parents from the village, participants from the non-Austrian side are 24 percentage points more likely to send more to co-villagers than to outsiders. Another experiment similar to ours is Chaudhary et al. (2020), who run a public goods experiment on opposite sides of an old colonial border in India. Their findings are similar to ours with respect to outsider–insider bias and intergenerational transmission. They find that people on the side with greater public good provision in the past (British India) contribute more (4%–5% of the endowment) to public goods that outsiders can benefit from, and this effect is confined mainly to those whose families are from the region. Walker (2020) combines a regression discontinuity analysis with a lab-in-the field experiment in the ==== (Suceava) as our experimental towns in order to test the persistence of imperial norms and institutions on savings behavior, although the discontinuity is done at the county level (not just within Udeşti county).==== Walker (2020) gains insight into how historical legacies affect access to finance from a set of farmers in Suceava who recently applied for an EU cash transfer program.==== She finds that farmers living in former Austrian regions are 18 percentage points more likely to have saved 1000 Lei (roughly one month’s salary), and this is mostly due to differential access to finance, not cultural norms. Although we do not find that people on opposite sides of the border have differential access to banks (Table A.2), this is not surprising given that we are focusing on one commune in which villages are mere kilometers apart, whereas Walker (2020) focuses on the entire county.====We do not wish to over-interpret our results for three reasons. First, these findings will be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. In such small villages, one would be worried about playing the same game twice. Second, in one respect we identify cultural differences off of three village-level observations. In such a micro-level study, it is possible that some unknown, benign event in one of the villages’ historical past is responsible for our results. Third, the external validity of our methodology is not obvious. Such issues are not faced with larger-N studies that employ IV or regression discontinuity to identify cultural differences. For this reason, we do not advocate that a ”low-N” study like ours be the ==== attempt at identifying cultural persistence across different populations. Instead, we suggest that such studies be done ==== other high-N studies employing some other technique to address identification. In our specific historical case, such studies have been undertaken (Dimitrova-Grajzl, 2007, Grosjean, 2011b, Karaja, 2013, Becker et al., 2016, Walker, 2020), while other experimental studies conducted on different continents find results of a similar flavor to ours (Lowes et al., 2017, Chaudhary et al., 2020). Both of these facts support the external validity of our results.====The paper proceeds as follows.

In a comparative perspective our results are shown to drive asymmetric responses across destinations of aggregate bilateral export flows to expected exchange rate movements.,"Variations in exchange rates (ER) influence the pricing decisions of exporting firms. Exporters tend to adjust their prices to prevent that the observed ER movements are entirely transmitted to the prices paid by foreign customers. Such pricing-to-market (PTM) strategies represent an important determinant of incomplete exchange rate pass-through (ERPT), the limited response of consumer prices to the changes in ER.==== The rich literature investigating firms’ export pricing decisions has shown that the adoption of PTM strategies is widespread but also heterogeneous along multiple dimensions of the firm, such as productivity, market shares, import intensity and output quality.==== While several previous studies have established that ER fluctuations, once realized and observed, trigger significant price adjustments by exporters, whether the variations in ER that are expected to take place in the future also affect firms’ PTM strategies remains an open issue. As abundant survey-based evidence suggests that companies are forward-looking in their behavior,==== it is expected that firms set their export prices not only to limit the pass-through of the observed ER variations into the destination prices, but also to react in advance to the expected evolution of foreign currencies. If this was the case, exporters’ PTM strategies would be informed by both backward- and forward-looking components, and the latter would also be influenced by the ER’s time and currency-specific uncertainty.====We use an original data-set combining detailed custom data on French exporters with information on exchange rates (observed and expected) among five currencies over the period 2000–2007.==== In this dataset we observe both realized exchange rate values and their expectations at 6 and 12 months. Future expected values are computed as the median forecast of a large pool of financial intermediaries and professional investors, whose degree of disagreement is exploited as measure of ER uncertainty.====First, we find that both observed and expected ER movements impact on export prices. In our sample the average exchange rate pass-through elasticity into producer (consumer) prices is around 0.3 (0.7), a value in line with much of the existing evidence.==== Export prices respond to expected ER movements with a sensitivity that is about 0.46, ====. Second, we find that the responses of export prices to expected ER movements are heterogeneous across exporters, reflecting the differences in firms’ relative market power in destination markets and their ability to adopt active PTM strategies: the larger is a firm’s market share for an exported product in a given destination, the stronger the reaction of its export prices to an expected ER variation.====These two results appear in line with theoretical models in which firms engage in dynamic price setting, thereby considering both realized and expected variations of all the determinants of their pricing decisions (see, for instance, Froot and Klemperer, 1989, Alessandria, 2009 and Alessandria et al. (2010)). In these theoretical settings, demand rigidities associated with various forms of lock-in effects create the incentives for firms to invest in their market shares in the short-run to extract higher profits in the future. Firms’ pricing becomes forward-looking and current prices also embed economic and market conditions expected to prevail in the future. As firms discount these dynamic effects through their current market shares in each destination, this implies that similar ER variations may lead to diverse consequences on export prices (and possibly on other firm-level outcomes) across destination markets as well as over time.====Our results emphasize the importance of expected ER movements on price-setting decisions of exporting firms. Future values of exchange rates are hard to predict, even for professional operators, who often disagree in their forecasts even for the near future (Rossi, 2013). Our dataset contains information on how profound these discordances are for each currency across operators, and we interpret it as a measure of expected future ER uncertainty in international markets.==== We study if the level of this uncertainty affects the way export prices are adjusted in light of expected ER movements. Our findings support the idea that the sensitivity of export prices to expected ER movements is lower when uncertainty is higher. In our preferred specification, the sensitivity of export prices to expected ER variations is reduced by more than half when uncertainty moves from mild to severe, i.e. when the discordance among banks, financial institutions and professional experts in their point forecasts is pre-eminent. This evidence corroborates our theoretical interpretation of state-contingent pricing decisions by the exporters. More precisely, it indicates that the exporters are more cautious to respond to expected ER changes when the uncertainty about them is larger. As the predictability of the ER differs across currencies and over time, the uncertainty regarding the ER evolution in the future contributes, together with the firms’ current market shares, to shape the time-varying and destination-specific PTM strategies adopted by the exporting companies.====Our results have significant aggregate implications. In a final empirical exercise we regress French bilateral trade flows with different destination markets, aggregated at the HS4 product categories, on realized and expected ER variations. Exploiting uniquely the variability across destinations, we show that bilateral trade flows significantly correlate with observed and expected ER fluctuations. However, the correlation with expected ER movements disappears when the forecasts are considered highly uncertain. Our work suggests that these aggregate asymmetric responses are driven by composite pricing adjustments of individual exporters that depend on their size distributions in each destination market and are mediated by the observed level of ER forecasts uncertainty.====. This paper bridges distinct branches of literature while providing new empirical evidence on firms’ export pricing decisions.====Our work contributes to the scant literature investigating how expected ER movements affect exporters’ pricing behavior. To the best of our knowledge (Li and Zhao, 2016) is the only work directly taking up this issue.==== They use bilateral transactions between China and the US only and focus on 2000–2008, when the ER between the US Dollar and the Chinese Renminbi was not free to float since it was manipulated by Chinese authorities in a rather predictable way within a regime of strict capital controls. Our work considers export transactions from France to several destinations, all market economies and with exchange rates free to float. Furthermore, we exploit the availability of data on various exchange rates to compare how exporters react to similar expected ER fluctuations in diverse destinations with different currencies.====Our paper also relates to the literature documenting that, in presence of high levels of uncertainty, firms tend to react more cautiously to changes in the surrounding environment. For example, it has been shown that higher levels of uncertainty are associated with firms’ lower willingness to hire and to invest.==== Unsurprisingly, uncertainty also affects those firms that are active in international markets.==== Berman et al. (2019) find that in uncertain environments exporters tend to attribute less attention to their beliefs about future market conditions and their demand learning process is weakened. By focusing on exporters’ pricing decisions, we show that the level of uncertainty about the ER evolution shapes firms’ time-varying reaction to expected ER variations.====Our results more broadly relate to the strand of research that shows that exchange rate volatility observed in the past deters firms’ exports, and that the intensity of this phenomenon depends on firm-specific characteristics.==== Similar to our work, Héricourt and Nedoncelle (2018) use French micro-level data and show that higher ER volatility reduces firms’ exports, the more so for multi-destination firms that divert disproportionately their trade from high- to low-volatility destinations.==== Observed volatility and uncertainty about the future are related but different concepts. The amplitude and the frequency of past fluctuations can be a poor proxy of uncertainty about future economic conditions. We contribute to this literature by exploiting the distribution of the expectations about exchange rates held by a pool of financial intermediaries, using the extent of the disagreement among them to proxy for real-time uncertainty.====This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and the construction of the variables that are used in regressions. Section 3 outlines the empirical model and the identification strategy, and investigates how the expectations of ER variations affect firms’ pricing strategies and its heterogeneous effects across firms. Section 4 introduces the concept of uncertainty and investigates to what extent the disagreement among financial intermediaries about future ER variations affects the sensitivity of firms’ export prices.

In order to evaluate the quality of corporate governance, we develop two corporate governance indices based on a large-scale survey of Russian enterprises – one for shareholder protection and one for transparency. We estimate standard investment regressions where the cash flow variable is interacted with our corporate governance indices and variables capturing the ownership structure. The central result is that better shareholder protection diminishes the cash flow sensitivity of investment, particularly in firms with an outside controlling owner. In contrast, we do not find such an effect for transparency, which can be partially explained by the threat of hostile takeovers. We address the problem of the endogeneity of corporate governance by using fixed-effects regressions and a novel instrumental variable based on particular legal provisions for corporate governance in Russia depending on the number of shareholders.","Restricted access to external finance in the form of bank loans, bond and equity issues, has been identified as one of the main impediments to firm growth, especially in emerging markets. In their review of large enterprise surveys, Dethier et al. (2011) rank the cost of finance and access to finance among the most important constraints faced by firms in developing countries. Emerging markets and their financial systems are particularly affected by informational and agency problems that may force firms to forego profitable investment projects. In this paper, we ask whether a good system of corporate governance can potentially overcome such problems and improve access to external funds.====The investigation of the relationship between corporate governance and access to external finance has mostly focused on the legal framework for investor protection (e.g., La Porta et al., 1997, McLean et al, 2012). Less is known about the effect of voluntary corporate governance arrangements at the firm level on the tightness of financing constraints. By studying firm-level data on a single country (Russia) with uniform investor protection laws we intend to shed more light on the question of whether, for a given economic and institutional environment in a country, firms can get better access to external finance by improving the quality of their corporate governance====Our measure of financing constraints is the sensitivity of corporate investment to internally generated funds (operating cash flows), going back to Fazzari et al. (1988). The argument is that asymmetric information and agency problems in capital markets drive a wedge between the cost of internal and external capital. The investment expenditure of a firm that can raise external capital only at a higher cost would then depend more on the availability of internal funds. While not unchallenged in the literature, the investment-cash flow sensitivity, henceforth ICFS, continues to be one of the main measures of financing constraints in the literature, and it has received particular empirical support for firms in emerging markets.====This paper investigates the effect of the quality of corporate governance on ICFS for a sample of unlisted companies.==== Unlisted firms typically represent a very large part of both developed and emerging market economies. Asker et al. (2015) report that non-listed firms in the US account for 69 percent of private sector employment and for 59 percent of sales. Brav (2009) calculates that unlisted firms account for 60 percent of the total assets of firms registered in the UK. In many emerging markets, these numbers are likely to be even higher since their stock markets are less developed. We calculate that in Russia, about 75 percent of total assets and 81 percent of sales come from unlisted firms.====Nevertheless, unlisted firms have received far less attention in the corporate governance literature than listed firms, mainly due to data limitations. Zhong (2015), a notable exception in this respect, argues that internal governance mechanisms might be even more important than in listed firms because unlisted firms provide less information to the public, cannot be taken over without the consent of their controlling owners, and are subject to fewer regulations. Also, unlisted firms are often smaller, and research has shown that smaller firms face more financing constraints (Beck and Demirgüç-Kunt, 2006; Beck et al., 2008). In short, external discipline imposed on unlisted firms is weaker, and asymmetric information problems are likely to be more severe.====Bank loans are the main source of external finance for unlisted firms. Indices of corporate governance measure to a large extent how well minority shareholders are protected. Why would the protection of minority shareholders be relevant to creditors? In countries with weak investor protection, the main agency problem is the expropriation of the firm's resources by controlling shareholders. Such practices would be even more relevant in bad times (Johnson et al., 2000), and might lead to bankruptcy in extreme cases.==== Thus, creditor and minority shareholder interests would be largely aligned. In addition, with good corporate governance, banks might save on monitoring costs.====Russia provides a good testing ground for the effect of corporate governance on financing and investment decisions. First of all, we observe considerable variation in our measures of corporate governance. Second, Russia is well-known for persistent corporate governance problems, such as non-transparent ownership structures, transfer pricing within corporate groups, boards with little real power, and the tunneling of cash flows through related-party transactions by dominant shareholders. Improvements in corporate governance might have a large effect in such an environment. Indeed, it has been shown that firm-level corporate governance and country-level investor protection are substitutes in terms of their effect on firm performance at a medium level of development (Doidge et al., 2007; Durnev and Kim, 2005; Klapper and Love, 2004; Bruno and Claessens, 2010).==== A similar result is obtained by Francis et al. (2013) with respect to the effect of corporate governance on ICFS: using data from 14 emerging markets, the authors show that firm-level governance becomes more important when country-level investor protection is relatively weak.====Our data on corporate governance comes from two rounds of a large-scale enterprise survey among Russian manufacturing firms in 2005 and 2006. The governance-related questions were included in a regular business survey, which guaranteed a high level of trust in the surveying institution and a high response rate. We matched these data with accounting information and did numerous cross-checks which confirmed the accuracy of the data to a large extent. Our research should also be relevant for the period after the survey given that the overall legal and business environment as well as the political system have not fundamentally changed since then.==== It should also be relevant for other emerging markets with similar levels of investor protection and concentrated ownership structures.====Furthermore, the paper makes a number of important contributions in addition to focusing on governance at the firm level and on unlisted firms. First, based on our survey data, we develop two separate corporate governance indices, one for shareholder protection and one for transparency and disclosure, and in this way allow for different effects on financing constraints.====Second, we account for the fact that corporate governance arrangements may work differently depending on whether a company's ownership is concentrated or whether control is shared between various large and small shareholders. In the case of shared control, the board might have important functions for joint decision making and monitoring while under a dominating shareholder the role of the board might be limited. A competing hypothesis would be that large shareholders need to commit to abstaining from self-dealing in order to receive external finance. Proper board procedures and composition, as well as other shareholder protection measures, may serve for this purpose. To test for such effects, we include interaction terms of our corporate governance indices and a measure of ownership concentration.====Third, we address the possible endogeneity of corporate governance with an instrumental variable approach. Endogeneity may result from reverse causality, namely the effect of investment and financing constraints on corporate governance. Our instrument is the number of shareholders, which determines certain legal requirements of corporate governance in Russia, while it has arguably no direct effect on investment.====Our main results are as follows: in keeping with most of the literature, we find positive ICFS. Our central result is that this sensitivity is reduced when shareholder protection is better. Our interpretation is that better shareholder protection alleviates financing constraints even in an environment with a low level of investor protection. We then investigate whether the effect of shareholder protection differs between firms with a single outside (non-government) majority owner and firms with less concentrated ownership. The estimations show that the mitigating effect of shareholder protection on ICFS comes entirely from firms with concentrated ownership. This is consistent with the hypothesis that large shareholders can reduce the relative costs of external funds compared to internally generated cash flows if they commit to abstaining from self-dealing.====Transparency and disclosure turn out ==== to have a general alleviating effect on financing constraints. We provide some evidence that transparency might actually be harmful and increase ICFS. This is particularly true for companies that are at risk of a hostile takeover, which often takes the form of illegal corporate raiding in Russia. Also companies with concentrated ownership exhibit this adverse effect of transparency, possibly because large shareholders have less incentive to monitor management when increased transparency prevents them from extracting private benefits (Östberg, 2006). As a consequence, banks and other investors might be less inclined to provide funds to such firms.====We estimate our models using two methods. The first is a firm fixed effects estimation which partially removes the possible omitted variable problems but uses only a subset of sample firms for which we have responses from the two survey rounds. The second is a pooled OLS regression on the whole sample. In both cases, standard errors are clustered at the firm level.====We perform a number of robustness checks. We re-estimate the model with variations on the ownership variable (with all outside owners, not only the largest one, and with actual ownership stakes instead of an indicator for a large outside shareholder). We perform Tobit regressions as investment is censored at zero for about 26% of the sample. We also construct governance indices as the first principal component instead of summing individual items, use different cash flow measures, and exclude firms in financial distress whose investment might be irresponsive to cash flows. By and large, they confirm and sometimes even reinforce our results.====Finally, we run instrumental variable regressions with five indicator variables for the size of the shareholder base (the number of shareholders) as instruments. They confirm the reduction of ICFS through better shareholder protection, in particular in firms with concentrated ownership, which allows for a causal interpretation of our main results.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature, provides some background on corporate governance in Russia, and puts forward our hypotheses. Section 3 describes the sample, our corporate governance index, and presents descriptive statistics of other relevant variables. Section 4 explains the estimation methodology.

We find a weak trade-off between aggregate wage inflation and unemployment. This link becomes more evident when the wage inflation is disaggregated at the sectoral and occupational level. The examination, using vacancy-level data, shows a negative correlation between offered wage and unemployment. The degree of wage elasticity, however, is different across regions and skill segments. Our findings suggest the importance of micro-level data's unique dimensions in examining the wage – unemployment relationship.","For decades, the Phillips curve, which shows the negative relationship between inflation and unemployment, has been used as guidance for developing monetary policy by many central banks. Yet, there has been an ongoing debate about the extent to which this link still exists. Some studies acknowledge the flattening of the Phillips curve in advanced economies (Beaudry and Doyle, 2000; Roberts, 2006), while others show that the curve prevails, after accounting for other factors, such as inflation expectations or sectoral heterogeneity (Imbs et al., 2011; Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2015; Moretti et al., 2019). Contributing to the debate is the development of the wage curve, which suggests a negative correlation between the level of wages and local unemployment. However, the wage curve has been also subject to criticisms related to potential biases and mismeasurements. Hence, despite the importance of both the Phillips and the wage curves, there is no consensus among scholars and policymakers on the existence and the strength of the link between wage and labour market conditions.====In this study, we shed light on this matter through a thorough analysis of the Phillips and the wage curves using micro-level data. More specifically, we exploit a unique dataset of online job vacancies from the Job Category on OLX.ua, a leading Ukrainian online advertisement platform. The data coverage is comprehensive, with more than one million job vacancies of 23 broadly defined categories posted daily over the 2016-2020 period in all regions of Ukraine. This rich dataset allows us to capture the country-wide labour market conditions more precisely. The various job dimensions contained in the dataset are also beneficial to our investigation of the ==== link, as we can control for different sources of heterogeneity, which are not observable in the aggregated data. In addition, the data at vacancy level, coupled with outflows of workers to neighbouring countries, provide us with a unique identification framework to examine the ==== relationship.====Using this dataset, we first construct an online wage index and show that this index is a reliable approximation of official statistics on the country-level wage growth. The examination of the Phillips curve is then undertaken at multiple levels of wage inflation, i.e., country, sectoral, and occupational levels. We find that, at the country level, the slope of the curve is weakly significant, even after controlling for inflation expectations. However, the existence of the Phillips curve becomes more pronounced at the higher levels of disaggregation, suggesting the importance of heterogeneity. We next move to the vacancy level data and perform a detailed analysis of the wage curve. The estimates reveal a negative link between offered wages and unemployment, which is strong in terms of both statistical and economic significances. Further investigation reveals that wage cyclicity is a heterogenous parameter across different regions, as well as high-/low-skill occupations.====This study contributes to three main strands of literature. The first strand is the well-developed literature on the Phillips curve (Phillips, 1958), which documents the trade-off between inflation and unemployment rate. Although this concept has been widely used as one of the fundamentals for the development of many macroeconomic theories, its disappearance has been of concern to economists and policymakers. This flattening could be explained by the “anchored expectations” hypothesis (e.g., Bernanke, 2010; Blanchard, 2016; Hooper et al., 2019). More specifically, if inflation expectations have become anchored, due to the increasing creditability of modern central banks, inflation will become significantly less sensitive to business cycles. An alternative explanation is the downward nominal wage rigidity, due to workers’ bargaining power (Ball and Mazumder, 2011; Daly and Hobijn, 2014). There is also evidence that long-term unemployment is less likely to influence inflation, due to its detachment from the labour market (Llaudes, 2005; Gordon 2013; Krueger et al., 2014).====It should be noted that most evidence of the Phillips curve flattening is based on the macro-level data, which lack important labour market dimensions, e.g., income composition or job types. These dimensions, however, are often contained in the disaggregated data and are the source of variations in wage dynamics (Kudlyak, 2015). For example, the micro-level data show that there is a substantial difference in the cyclicity of wages across worker categories, e.g., newly hired workers, job stayers, and job movers (Shin, 1994; Carneiro et al., 2012; Kudlyak, 2014; Daly and Hobijn, 2017). Wage cyclicity also varies across income distribution groups, demographic groups, and other structural characteristics (Solon et al., 1994; Devereux and Hart 2006; Martins, 2007; Dapi, 2020). Overall, existing studies indicate that individual wages are highly procyclical, while aggregate average wages are subject to a composition bias. Thus, the examination of the Phillips curve using micro-level data could enable us to capture the important heterogeneity that cannot be observed in the macro-based analyses. The contribution of this study is that our Phillips curve examination utilizes a rich micro-level dataset. In doing this, we can shed new light on the extent to which micro evidence is informative in reflecting the (wage) inflation – unemployment relationship.====The second strand that this study contributes to is the literature on the wage curve – the negative link between the level of wages and local unemployment rate (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1994; 1995). Although the wage curve appears to be a robust empirical concept (Nijkamp and Poot, 2005) with supporting evidence from different countries, it has been subject to several criticisms.==== Some such criticisms have not been fully addressed using the existing data. It is possible that the wage curve is a mis-specified labour-supply curve, rather than reflecting the wage setting behaviours. Further, an endogeneity bias may exist, as the level of wages may also affect the unemployment level. In addition, the estimates of the wage curve's slope could be sensitive to the choice of the dependent variable measures. For example, using earnings as a payment indicator may lead to bias, as an increase in earnings can be attributed to either higher wage or higher number of hours worked.====The dataset of online job vacancies, coupled with the recent developments in the Ukrainian labour market, allow us to address at least partially these concerns. First, employing our unique data, we can control for labour market slackness/labour supply at the finely disaggregated levels, e.g., sector – region in the wage curve estimation. Thus, any significant estimates of unemployment, after controlling for the local labour supply/labour market slackness, would indicate the existence of a wage-setting curve. Second, although not perfect, we can use the growing opportunities for Ukrainian workers to work abroad as a source of exogenous variation in an instrumental variable framework. This approach allows us to check the robustness of the wage curve estimates.====This study also contributes to the recent studies that exploit data on job vacancies posted on online job search platforms, as an alternative source for labour economics research. Some studies apply textual analytics and machine learning techniques to extract important information, e.g., skill requirements, from the job description/advertisement text (Deming and Kahn, 2018). The extracted information is then employed in the analysis of trends in skill demand or market segmentation (Hershbein and Kahn, 2017). Other studies use online vacancy data to examine the changes in aggregate labour markets and to create labour market indices. For instance, online data have been used to measure skill mismatch, labour supply/demand, and labour market concentration/tightness. Subsequently, these indices can be employed to investigate the employment effects of minimum wages, as well as to predict wages, the rate of mismatch unemployment, expected unemployment duration, and migration patterns (e.g., Adrjan and Lydon, 2019; Mamertino and Sinclair, 2019; Turrell et al., 2019; Azar et al., 2020). Our study complements this strand of literature by providing additional evidence for the usefulness of online vacancy data in capturing the aggregate labour market. Moreover, we show that this type of data can be utilized to understand, not only labour market dynamics, but also the broader macroeconomic issues, i.e., the link between wage setting and unemployment.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

Subjects in the treatment group watched an “ad” that had been aired during soccer transmissions as part of this campaign. They were then asked about their vote intentions. Relative to subjects in the control group, their declared preference for the challenger drops by 6.5 percentage points for a persuasion rate of 11.2%. We find no effects of the three types of defenses employed by the challenger (a positive message unrelated to the “ad”, a reply to the accusations in the “ad”, and a counter-attack). The propaganda effect is driven by women.","An important question in politics concerns the ability of governments to affect voter intentions through State-sponsored advertising or propaganda. In advanced democracies, political campaigns have traditionally been constrained by norms and institutions; for example, by limiting the extent to which candidates can lie or make misleading statements about their competitors, or by restricting the financial influence of the State on media companies. Democratic institutions complement a free press, for example, ensuring competition so that people who do not want to consume political advertisement can avoid it. In developing countries these constraints are often weaker, so State-sponsored propaganda is more frequent and presumed to be more effective. However, it is also possible that in these settings people are more aware of the possibility of media bias and hence more likely to discount its influence on their views.==== Of course, the “fake news” phenomenon and the relevance of populist candidates in rich countries suggest that learning about the effectiveness of propaganda efforts is relevant more broadly.====In this paper, we study an attempt to influence voter preferences during the weeks prior to the 2015 Argentine presidential ballotage, a setting characterized by widespread use of State-sponsored propaganda. We exploit two main aspects of the use of the media during the Kirchners’ administrations (2003–2015): the likely awareness of potential bias by consumers, and a significant difficulty in avoiding these messages. Gradually, since the beginning of the administration, media companies either owned by the State or by private allies, or those heavily dependent on public advertisement, biased reports in favor of the government, and attacked critics and opposition politicians. There was widespread perception of bias in the messages released by media outlets that were heavily influenced by the government (Gervasoni and Tagina, 2019). Such pro-government inclination was frequently denounced by critics, but openly defended as legitimate by some journalists and members of the government, citing a pro-business bias in traditional media. In other words, the bias in the State-sponsored media was accepted and defended publicly by the Kirchner supporters. Moreover, President Cristina Kirchner often made speeches that were simultaneously broadcasted through all TV and radio networks in the country (these were mandatory so even independent media had to take part). This combination of public media, private media owned by government proxies, public advertisement in private media, and mandatory broadcasting limited the ability of consumers to exit and follow their natural tendency to read and watch like-minded outlets.====Avoiding these political messages became particularly difficult for soccer viewers once the government undertook the monopolistic broadcasting of Argentine games in 2009. The previous business model, with transmission of soccer games on paid cable TV with private advertising, was replaced that year by Soccer for All (or, in Spanish, ====). This TV show enjoyed the monopoly of Argentine soccer transmission (the 1st and 2nd division, the Argentina Cup, and the national team), broadcasting for free in open TV the main soccer matches of the country. The show audience was considerable, as soccer is very popular in Argentina. Advertisement in ==== became almost exclusively public. Political ads were regularly aired at halftime together with highlights from the first-half and from other games, and also during the games (through banners and announcer commentary). In this way, propaganda messages reached captive soccer fans regardless of their political inclinations.====In particular, we study the use of official propaganda in the period just prior to the 2015 Argentine presidential runoff between Nestor Kirchner's former vice-president, Daniel Scioli, of the incumbent Peronist party and the challenger, Mauricio Macri. The runoff was scheduled four weeks after the first-round presidential election of October 25th. According to the initial polls, Macri was expected to secure a comfortable victory, when the government's propaganda campaign was set in full motion. Twelve days later Scioli had almost closed the gap, with Macri finally winning the presidency by only 2.68 percentage points.====Our study uses data obtained between the two election rounds in a survey experiment from participants regularly engaged online by a public opinion and marketing firm. While a control group was exposed to a neutral video describing the voting procedures, a treatment group watched an “ad” that was one of the key pieces of propaganda employed by the government campaign. This ad, first aired during halftime of an important soccer game that defined the season championship, “explained” the similarities between the economic program of the Argentine military dictatorship of 1976–83 and that of Macri's. The ad presented statements of Jose Alfredo Martinez de Hoz, a former Minister of Economy and a central figure of the dictatorship, and compared them with old statements by Macri and members of his team. It explicitly claimed that Macri had a similar economic program to that of the dictatorship, and wanted to “adjust” and open the economy, lower government spending, and reduce export taxes to bring about a drastic wage adjustment. For example, one of the excerpts showed a clip of a young Macri being interviewed several years before he entered politics (when he was a businessman) explaining that “costs are too high, and wages are a source of costs.” This was denounced as out of context by critics of the government and defended as relevant by supporters. In addition, a subsample watched the “ad” followed by one of the “antidotes” used at the time to respond to the government campaign. These three alternative responses were: a video of Macri presenting a set of positive policy proposals, a video of Macri denying the accusations made to him in the propaganda ad, or a counter-attack on Scioli. Subjects were then asked to answer a follow-up opinion survey including their 2nd round vote intentions.====The data reveal several interesting patterns. First, watching the government's propaganda caused subjects to reduce their intention to vote for Macri in the coming runoff election by 6.5 percentage points. This is paired with an increase of 2 percentage points in the intention to vote for Scioli and a 4.5 percentage point increase in the group that is undecided. The decrease in the intentions to vote for Macri implies a persuasion rate of 11.2%, which is in the mid-range of the persuasion rates reported in della Vigna and Gentzkow (2010). Second, we find no effect of the “antidotes,” consistent with the suspicions of Macri's electoral team (as described in Iglesias Illa, 2016). Third, the results are driven by women: whereas the estimated coefficient on the propaganda campaign in the men subsample is zero, the propaganda campaign reduces the women's preference for Macri by almost 12 percentage points. There is also some evidence that women, in contrast to men, believe the ad message that Macri would lower wages. These heterogeneous gender results could be capturing differences in prior exposure to the campaign during soccer matches (Poliarquia, 2013). Another potential explanation for the gender difference is women being more sensitive to the social concerns raised by the propaganda campaign (see Edlund and Pande, 2002, Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005, and the review by Niederle, 2016).====Social scientists have been interested in propaganda at least since Lasswell (1927), although much of the early research often uncovered effects described as “minimal” (see, for example, Klapper, 1960).==== Later studies documented a correlation between measures of exposure to political advertising and voter preferences (e.g., Baum, 2002). An early paper to study the causal effect of political advertising is della Vigna and Kaplan (2007), who exploit the staggered availability of the Fox News channel on voting in the US. They find Fox availability in otherwise similar towns increased the Republican share of votes in the 2000 presidential election by half a percentage point.==== A related study by Gerber et al. (2011) provides experimental evidence on the effects of political advertising during a gubernatorial campaign in Texas in 2006. Exploiting the random assignment of the launch date and volume of television advertising to each experimental media market, they find strong but short-lived effects on voter preferences captured with a large daily tracking poll (see, also, Huber and Arceneaux, 2007).====Studies of the effect of the media outside of the US uncover bigger effects and are closer in spirit to the setting we study given the weaker institutional context.==== For example, Enikolopov et al. (2011) study the government-controlled media market in Russia. They show how access to the one independent TV station was largely idiosyncratic conditional on observables and correlated with a decrease in the vote of the government party of almost 9 percentage points and a decrease in turnout of under 4 points. We see our paper as complementing their study, both because of the institutional setting, and because it highlights the possibility of significant effects of political campaigns when citizens lack the alternative of switching to alternative media, in spite of their awareness of potential biases.====Our paper is also connected to studies focused on misleading statements, or where consumers are actively trying to avoid propaganda. One example of the former is Di Tella et al. (2012) which studies false statements during the Kirchner's propaganda campaign prior to the nationalization of the water services. Surprisingly, the article finds that groups that had gained access to water following the privatization and subsequently enjoyed large welfare gains, were only marginally less likely to believe Nestor Kirchner's false claims that there had been no investment during privatization. Consistent with our new results, that paper failed to find significant effects of the firm's defense against these accusations.==== An example of the latter is Durante and Knight (2012), who provide a clean demonstration of how the consumption of the media changes with the perception of partisan bias. Using data for Italy under Silvio Berlusconi, they show that when news content on public television shifted to the right, right-leaning viewers increased their propensity to watch public channels, while left-leaning viewers reacted by switching to another channel controlled by the left. Importantly, this behavioral response did not fully offset the changes in public news content to the right.====A second example is Knight and Tribin (2019a, 2019b), who show how the effects of Hugo Chavez's propaganda varied across TV channels depending on the viewers’ ideological inclinations and on the availability of a remaining independent television channel. More importantly, they are able to demonstrate that Chavez's electoral support and approval ratings were higher in areas were State censorship was more successful and TV viewers did not have access to opposition sources of information.====Finally, our paper is connected to Galasso and Nannicini (2016)’s detailed study of propaganda messages during two mayoral campaigns in Italy. As in our study, they find sharp gender differences. There are, however, several differences with our setting, including that they can study variation in the gender of the candidate going negative.====Section 2 describes State-sponsored propaganda in Argentina during the three Kirchners’ administrations. Section 3 describes our data and empirical strategy.

Employing the most comprehensive export data from China for the 2000–2007 period, we provide sector- and firm-level evidence that the response of exports to exchange rate movements depends crucially on the level of financial constraints. For sectors with large financial constraints, the response is small, whereas, for less financially constrained sectors, the response can be much larger, with the estimated elasticity decreasing with the sector's degree of financial constraints. At the firm-level, financial constraints affect the firm's response to exchange rate shocks at both the intensive and the extensive margins. At the intensive margin, financial constraints dampen the effect of exchange rate on exports by restricting the firm's export value to the existing destination market; at the extensive margin, financial constraints restrict the number of firms participating in exporting, the number of firm-product pairs being exported, and the probability of entering a new destination market.","One puzzling observation in international economics is the lack of response of exports to exchange rate fluctuations. For example, Fitzgerald and Haller (2014) document that aggregate exports are not very responsive to the real exchange rate changes: the estimated exchange rate elasticity using Irish data is 0.42. Chaney (2016) documents that the euro–dollar fluctuations have only a limited impact on trade flows between the Euro Zone and the United States. Li et al. (2015) show that both the price and volume responses of Chinese exporters to RMB appreciation are moderate.==== In this paper, we provide one possible explanation by demonstrating that when firms are financially constrained, their response to exchange rate movements would be attenuated, particularly in those sectors that are more dependent on external funds.====Why does financial constraint matter? In a traditional trade model, currency depreciation reduces the price that foreign buyers face, and therefore, encourages exports. However, such an effect can be lessened because financially constrained firms cannot optimally expand exports. First, firms need to incur fixed costs, often paid in the currency of the destination country, to enter the foreign market (Chaney, 2016). In this case, a depreciation in home currency would increase the fixed costs of export relative to the value of domestic assets, and therefore, discourages further entries, offsetting the gaining of competitiveness because of depreciation. Similarly, when the exchange rate appreciates, existing exporters reduce their exports, while financially constrained (but productive) firms may start exporting, and consequently, compensate for the reduced exports of incumbents. The aggregate effect of the exchange rate fluctuations on export would consequently be alleviated in the presence of financial constraints. Note that this channel is not limited to the firm's entry into foreign markets (i.e., the extensive margin). In the presence of frictions in the funding of variable costs, which are also partly paid in foreign currency, the response of export value to the exchange rate (i.e., the intensive margin) can also be affected by financial constraints. A depreciation in home currency would increase the cost of export, and therefore, offset the gain in export demand. Similarly, when the exchange rate appreciates, the reduction in export cost would promote (formerly suppressed) export supply and lead to a low reduction in equilibrium export. Second, many firms hold both domestic and foreign assets; thus, the exchange rate fluctuations will change their capacity of pledging collateral (Kohn et al., 2020). An appreciation, for example, increases a firm's asset value in home currency and enables it to borrow more. In this case, the exchange rate directly affects the firm's financial conditions, and therefore, affects its export behavior. Finally, with capital account liberalization, firms may also finance their fixed and/or variable production costs through the international market. In this case, an appreciation makes the firm's foreign debt cheaper, and thus, alleviates its financial burden, which may promote exports.====In this paper, we aim to empirically verify and quantify the effect of financial constraints on a firm's response to exchange rate movements, at both the extensive and the intensive margins. Using the most comprehensive export data at the sector- and firm-level from China, we illustrate that the response of exports to exchange rate movements depends crucially on the level of financial constraints. For sectors with larger financial constraints, the response is small, whereas, for less financially constrained sectors, the response can be much larger. In the baseline estimation, the exchange rate elasticity varies from 0.12 to 0.71, which decreases with a sector's degree of financial constraints, measured using the external finance dependence in Rajan and Zingales (1998). When we use liquidity needs to measure financial constraints, the sign of the exchange rate elasticity can even be reversed, leading to a wide range of exchange rate elasticity from −0.43 to 1.18. These findings are robust to adding other industry characteristics, such can factor intensity, capital-labor ratio, and an indicator for durable goods.====The response of exports at the sector level is a mixed outcome of the responses by incumbent and new exporters. As described above, financial constraints affect both incumbent and new exporters. This is indeed the case when we further examine firm-level evidence: at the intensive margin, financial constraints dampen the effect of exchange rate on exports by restricting the firm's export value to the existing destination market; while at the extensive margin, financial constraints restrict the number of firms participating in exports, the number of firm-product pairs being exported, and the probability of a firm entering a new destination market.====Although financial constraint is one of the explanations for the lack of response to exchange rate movements, other channels might also play a role. Therefore, we also examine the robustness of our results by controlling markup adjustment, which is discussed in the literature to be an important channel for firm-level adjustment. Our results show that firms with higher markups are indeed less affected by exchange rate fluctuations. However, besides the markup adjustment, the effect of financial constraints remains robust and significant.====In the above examination, we use sector financial constraints measures of Rajan and Zingales (1998), which has the main advantage of being exogenous and reflecting the “technological” part of investments that must be funded externally. However, firms are heterogeneous even within a narrowly defined industry. Thus, we delve deeper to explore firm financial constraints heterogeneity and their impacts on responses to exchange rate movements. We classify firms into different groups, based on ownership and size. We also replace the sector financial constraints measures with the firm's initial level of financial health variables, including leverage ratio, liquidity ratio, and interest payment. All experiments confirm the mitigating effect of financial constraints.====We provide several novel contributions to the literature. First, the vast body of literature such as Manova (2013) has recognized financial constraints as one of the key determinants of a firm's export behavior. We further illustrate that financial constraints also play an important role in affecting the firm's response to exchange rate movements. The effect of financial constraints on firms’ performances, including export performance, has been extensively examined. Many studies have also documented that exchange rate fluctuations have a moderate effect on exports. Our paper is the first that combines these two strands of literature.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical background on how financial constraints might affect the response of exports to exchange rate fluctuations. Section 3 describes the data we employ.

The political budget cycle theory posits that incumbents adopt an expansionary fiscal policy before elections to increase their chance of reelection. The theory implies the presence of pre-electoral increases in deficits or government spending.====Previous empirical studies have shown that the political budget cycle is a phenomenon of new democracies or less developed countries (Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya 2004; Brender and Drazen 2005, 2007; Shi and Svensson 2006; Schuknecht 1996; Vergne 2009).==== The political budget cycle is significant in new democracies potentially because voters are less experienced with electoral politics and lack the information to evaluate fiscal manipulation, for example, due to inexperienced media (Brender and Drazen 2005, 2007).====However, a number of studies have also found evidence of the political budget cycle (i.e., election-year increases in deficits or overall expenditures) for old democracies and developed economies (Alt and Lassen 2006; Buti and Van Den Noord 2004; Comiskey 1993; Efthyvoulou 2012; Mink and De Haan 2006; Tujula and Wolswijk 2007; Streb ==== 2009). For instance, Alt and Lassen (2006) found a persistent pattern of fiscal balance cycles in a sample of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.====A potential explanation for the inconsistent findings is that many new democracies that are defective fail to become an embedded democracy although they gain experience in electoral politics and gain economic development (Bogaards 2009). A defective democracy is susceptible to the political budget cycle because the central elements of a functioning democracy—such as checks and balances, political rights, rule of law, and effective government—are impaired.====Using data from 64 democracies from 1987 to 2016, we show that a political budget cycle is rather a phenomenon of a defective democracy. To separate defective democracies from embedded democracies, we apply cluster analysis to the central elements of democracy instead of relying on a qualitative approach (such as case studies), as is common in the literature. We find that the political budget cycle is significant only in defective democracies. The main results are generally robust to various alternative specifications: an alternative list of defective democracy, alternative dependent variables, sample periods, timing and definition of the election, endogeneity of election, control variables and estimation methods, constitutional rules, government ideology, the length of democracy, and the level of economic development. We also find that weak rule of law and ineffective government mainly explain the presence of political budget cycles in defective democracies.====The presence of a political budget cycle by democratic status has important policy implications because the electoral cycle may persist even though new democracies become old and emerging economies become advanced. Because democratic attributes (i.e., patterns of central elements) vary across democracies, the political budget cycles are likely to follow different trends according to these attributes. This emphasizes the importance of the selection criteria for defining democracy when testing for the political budget cycle (Barberia and Avelino 2011).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Initiated in 1983, the reform, implemented over a 20-year period, transferred the decision-making powers of county-level governments to prefecture-level governments. We use a difference-in-differences approach to evaluate the heterogeneous urbanisation of counties in response to this centralisation reform. The distributional effects include greater urban primacy and a more marked core–periphery structure at the prefecture level. Further analyses reveal that the results are driven by the reallocation of fiscal resources and industrial production based on both productivity advantages and political favouritism.","Most countries have disparities in economic activity not only between rural and urban areas but also between cities. Of the disparities across cities, urban primacy, wherein one city in a group is dominant, is the most pronounced. Well-known examples include Paris in France, Tokyo in Japan and Mexico City in Mexico. Previous studies using cross-country data (Ades and Glaeser, 1995) or adopting a theoretical perspective (Henderson and Becker, 2000) show that political factors play a key role in urban primacy. However, within-country evidence of the relationship between political factors and urban primacy, which might provide more convincing evidence of causality by avoiding great heterogeneity across countries, is rare.====In this study, we use a historical reform in China to identify the causal relationship between the centralisation of political hierarchy and urban primacy. Multi-layer political hierarchies, characterised by a central government and various levels of local government, are common in many countries. The vertical relationships between these levels of government affect the independence of each level’s governance, and thus the characteristics of centralisation. In China, before 1983, county-level governments in every prefecture had independent decision-making powers over various issues, including fiscal, administrative and political affairs, in their own counties, while prefecture-level governments were largely powerless. In the hierarchy reform that began in 1983, the central government empowered prefecture-level governments by transforming prefectures into more centralised “prefecture-level cities”. In this reform, county-level governments lost their decision-making powers, and governance became more centralised at the prefecture level. We use the variations in political centralisation resulting from this reform to explore its impact on urban primacy. Specifically, we investigate whether urbanisation has become concentrated in the capital counties in which prefecture-level governments are located.====We use variations in the timing of the reform across prefectures and the predetermined status of capital/peripheral counties to perform a difference-in-differences (DID) regression. Our results show that capital counties benefit from this reform in which governance is centralised in prefecture-level cities, but peripheral counties that lose decision rights are hurt. These heterogeneous responses to the reform aggravate the disparities between capital counties and peripheral counties, eventually leading to urban primacy. The causal relationship is verified by a series of checks, including an event study approach to confirm the parallel pre-trends, a placebo test using a “de jure” reform in Zhejiang province, and robustness checks, such as controlling for county-specific time trends. In addition to the urbanisation outcomes, we find that the reform is associated with increasing disparities in the received transfer payments and the expenditures of capital and peripheral counties. Furthermore, firm-level evidence indicates that urban concentration is largely due to productivity advantages and political favouritism in the capital counties.====This study is closely related to previous efforts to investigate the sources of urban primacy and, more generally, the sources of regional disparities, particularly those related to political institutions. Previous studies by urban economists, such as Henderson and Becker (2000), provide insights into the significant influence of political institutions on urban primacy during the urbanisation process.==== Ades and Glaeser, 1995, Davis and Henderson, 2003 and Henderson and Wang (2007) use cross-country data to show that autocratic countries tend to concentrate urban growth in a small number of primate cities – capitals in most cases – but that democratisation limits the ability of a national ruling class to concentrate resources in the national capital. This study offers subnational causal evidence of this process. In the most closely related study, Chen et al. (2017) find that cities ranking higher in China’s political hierarchy enjoy lower capital prices and grow faster than other cities.==== Our study differs from the latter study in that it uses the variations resulting from a hierarchy reform to identify the distributional effects on cities at a given level of political hierarchy.====Second, this study contributes to the literature on organisational economics. Many studies of hierarchies in organisations theoretically describe the trade-off between deepening vertical layers and broadening the horizontal span of control (Simon, 1976, Calvo and Wellisz, 1978, Tirole et al., 1986, Qian, 1994, Chen and Suen, 2019). However, in the context of transition countries such as China and Russia, although the organisation of the government system has long been regarded as a determinant of economic growth in theory (Maskin et al., 2000, Qian et al., 2006, Xu, 2011), the empirical evidence is thin and mixed. Among the limited within-country studies on this topic, Markevich and Zhuravskaya (2011) test the theory using Khrushchev’s Sovnarkhoz reform in Soviet Russia.====Many studies explore administrative reforms in China. For example, Fan et al. (2012) find that an upgrading-county reform to create cities failed to benefit counties’ economic performance. Li et al. (2016) show a loss in GDP per capita resulting from the flattening of the government hierarchy. Tang and Hewings (2017) and Han and Wu (2019) find that incorporating counties into prefectures persistently increased the economic growth of these counties. Related studies focus on other dimensions of outcomes, such as public goods, tax capacity and housing prices (Liu and Alm, 2016, Huang et al., 2017, Ma and Mao, 2018, Bo et al., 2020). We complement their work by providing evidence of the impact of the government’s organisational structure on urbanisation and urban primacy.====Our study also contributes to the literature on the relationship between political institutions and economic development, particularly the debate on centralisation and decentralisation. Earlier studies model the basic trade-offs between centralisation and decentralisation in theory (Oates, 1972, Seabright, 1996, Besley and Coate, 2003, Cai and Treisman, 2004). However, the empirical evidence is mixed, and most studies focus on the overall effect of decentralisation.==== A recent study by Bo (2020) uses the same setting as this study and finds that the centralisation brought about by the 1983 reform improved the overall industrial productivity in the treated prefectures as a whole. Rather than considering the overall effect, this study focuses on the distributional effects on counties, which are small-scale entities, losing their decision powers. Together with Bo (2020), we reveal a clear efficiency–equity trade-off in the process of centralisation.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the related context. Section 3 introduces the data and the empirical strategy used. Section 4 presents the empirical results regarding the distributional effects on counties.

Using longitudinally matched monthly panel data, we document very low labor force dynamics in the state sector, which leads to a high long-term unemployment rate. We develop and estimate an equilibrium search and matching model with three differences between the state and non-state sectors: labor productivity, labor adjustment cost, and workers’ bargaining power. Counterfactual analysis shows that, among the three channels, reducing the bargaining power of state sector workers is most effective in reducing unemployment duration and unemployment rate.","State-owned enterprises (SOEs) hold the key to understanding various aspects of the Chinese economy, which has become increasingly integrated with and influential in the wider world. In this paper, we study the effect of China’s SOEs on its labor market using an equilibrium search and matching framework. Jobs in SOEs are colloquially termed “iron rice bowls”, as they tend to pay more and are more secure than non-SOE jobs (see, e.g., Meng, 2012 and Ge and Yang, 2014). However, areas with a higher concentration of SOEs, such as China’s interior region, are also more likely to have higher levels of unemployment and longer unemployment durations compared to coastal areas, which have fewer SOEs.==== This observation may be best understood in a general equilibrium framework, as the higher wages in SOEs may hinder job creation, thereby reducing the overall dynamics in the labor market and increasing unemployment. This is precisely what we find in this paper using high-frequency monthly labor force data.====Our study adds to the large literature on China’s SOEs (e.g., Brandt and Zhu, 2001, Hsieh and Song, 2015, and Berkowitz et al., 2017). Specifically, we complement previous macro models of SOEs, which emphasize capital market distortions (Song et al., 2011, Brandt et al., 2013) and usually ignore the labor market or assume it to be competitive and frictionless. Our study fills this void by developing and estimating a two-sector search and matching model incorporating key differences in the labor market between the state and non-state sectors. The study of labor market impacts of the state sector is also essential for properly formulating further SOE reform policies. Our empirical results suggest that, in order to improve labor market dynamics and bring down the unemployment rate, it is important to reduce the bargaining power of SOE workers. This is consistent with recent major government initiatives that call for curtailing wage growth in the state sector.====We first report new stylized facts on Chinese urban labor market dynamics using longitudinally matched monthly panel data from the Urban Household Survey (UHS) for 2003–2006, a period when labor market structural reforms were completed and mass layoffs at SOEs had ceased (Feng et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to have access to the internal monthly UHS data, which are representative of urban China. We find much smaller flows into and out of the state sector compared with the non-state sector.==== Moreover, we show that China has a much higher long-term unemployment rate compared to many other developed and developing countries, which is a result of the low flows from unemployment to employment in the state sector. Since the public sector in many developed countries also has smaller in-flows and out-flows than the private sector (Fontaine et al., 2020), studying the low dynamics of China’s SOEs is not only important for the understanding of the Chinese labor market, but also of more general interest.====To that end, we extend the Diamond–Mortensen–Pissarides equilibrium search and matching framework by incorporating two different sectors, state and non-state and allow for on-the-job search. Building on the existing literature, we explicitly model three differences between SOEs and non-SOEs. First, we allow the labor productivity level of SOEs to be potentially different from that of non-SOEs.==== Second, we assume that SOEs are unable to lay off workers even when workers become unproductive.==== Third, workers in the two sectors are allowed to have different bargaining powers.==== State sector and non-state sector firms maximize profits subject to these institutional differences, and they compete for workers in the same labor market. Workers can search for and match with both types of employers when unemployed or on-the-job. When a worker and a firm form a match, wages are determined by bargaining over the surplus created. The model then derives the flows among the three labor force statuses: unemployment, the state sector employment, and the private sector employment. In equilibrium, such flows are translated into important labor market outcomes, including unemployment duration, unemployment rate, and state-sector employment share.====In the empirical analysis, we estimate the model using the UHS data and conduct counterfactual exercises to better understand the effects of each of the three modeled differences between SOEs and non-SOEs.==== First, We examine effects of equalizing productivities of the two sectors. We estimate that SOEs’ productivity is 93% of that of non-SOE firms. Increasing SOEs’ productivity to the level of non-SOE firms only has negligible effect on transitions from unemployment to employment (U–E transitions) and on the equilibrium unemployment rate. Second, We allow SOEs to fire unproductive workers, as the non-SOEs do. This actually leads to a slight decrease in U–E transitions, from 2.58% to 2.55%. The results suggest that high firing costs in SOEs are not the main reason for the low transition rates from unemployment to employment in the Chinese labor market. Allowing SOEs to fire unproductive workers improves SOEs’ incentives to hire, but decreases the attractiveness of SOE jobs to workers due to loss of job security. On the other hand, as a result of an increase in transitions from state-sector employment to unemployment, the unemployment rate would increase from 7.0% to 10.5%. Third, we consider equalizing the bargaining powers of workers in the two sectors. The estimation results show that state-sector workers have much higher bargaining power than private-sector workers (0.95 vs. 0.50). Reducing the bargaining power of state-sector workers to the level of private-sector workers leads to a substantial increase in U–E transitions, from 2.58% to 3.95%, and a large decline in the expected unemployment duration, from 38.7 months to 25.3 months. In addition, the unemployment rate declines from 7.0% to 3.1%. Finally, when we combine all three channels and make the SOEs identical to the non-SOEs, average unemployment duration would decline by 13.2 months and unemployment rate would decrease by 0.2 percentage points. Overall, the results suggest that the very high bargaining power of SOE workers is the main institutional difference between the state and private sectors responsible for the low transitions from unemployment to employment. Reducing the bargaining power of SOE workers could be a productive direction for future policy reform, because it would lead to a substantial reduction in unemployment duration and unemployment rate at the same time.====In addition to contributing to the literature on China’s state sector and labor market, our paper is related to the recent body of research on two-sector search models that captures either the public and private sectors in developed countries (see, e.g., Algan et al., 2002, Quadrini and Trigari, 2007, Hörner et al., 2007, Burdett, 2012, Bradley et al., 2017, Gomes, 2018, Gomes, 2015, Albrecht et al., 2018) or the formal and informal sectors in Latin American countries (see, e.g., Albrecht et al., 2009, Bosch and Esteban-Pretel, 2012, and Meghir et al., 2015). These models are characterized by the specific institutional background of the economic systems under study. Our contribution is to build a two-sector search and matching model that incorporates the most salient features of the Chinese economic system, in which SOEs and non-SOEs coexist. Specifically, unlike other models, ours allows employment and wages in both sectors to be endogenously determined and workers to switch employers when a better match appears.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides background information regarding the Chinese urban labor market and reviews the related literature. Section 3 introduces the UHS monthly data. Section 4 reports the main stylized facts on labor market dynamics in urban China, and the different patterns for SOEs and non-SOEs. In Section 5, we develop a two-sector equilibrium search and matching model that incorporates three key institutional differences between SOEs and non-SOEs. This is followed by a discussion of the estimation strategies in Section 6, and the main results are reported in Section 7.

A question therefore arises as to whether the way in which the cultural background has evolved during last decades affects the growth rate of economies. We use an unbalanced panel dataset comprised from 34 OECD countries from 1981 to 2019, and a Least Squares Dummy Variable Correction (LSDVC) method as well as a series of robustness tests including different methods of analysis, adding control variables and breaking the overall period into subperiods. We conclude that the cultural background during the overall period under consideration is characterized as post-materialistic and harms economic growth. Moreover, we highlight both theoretically and empirically the cultural backlash hypothesis since the cultural background of the countries under analysis presents a shift from traditional/materialistic (from 1981 up to 1998) to post-materialist values (from 1999 up to 2019). Doing so, we conclude on a positive effect of cultural background on economic growth when traditional / materialistic values prevail, and a negative effect when post-materialistic values prevail. These results highlight culture as a crucial factor for economic growth and indicate that economic policy makers should take it seriously into account before designing economic policy and in order to explain the effectiveness of economic policies implemented.","The change in cultural values over time is an issue of concern for economic science as it is responsible for shaping economic, political, and social life. Human behavior and ultimately economic decisions and actions depend heavily on the cultural background of individuals (Throsby, 2001). Indeed, the characteristics that are passed on from one generation to the other appear to have a significant impact on the development and growth of economies (Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2013). It is a process of cultural evolution where a set of processes takes place (Boyd and Richerson, 2005), in which the cultural background is transmitted between individuals/societies and across generations, including elements of psychology and communication.====The literature on cultural background change focuses mainly on the fact that this change is particularly slow (Johnston, 1996; De Jong, 2009; Schwartz, 2009). However, various developments taking place mainly in developed economies in recent decades seem to have led to either an incremental change or a sudden change in the cultural background. As a result, ""examining"" a broader period of analysis may be valuable in understanding the impact of cultural background changes on economic growth. Norris and Inglehart (2019) report that in recent decades, there is a process of changing the cultural background of societies from traditional/materialistic to post-materialist values in the developed western world.====At the same time, the emergence of post-materialistic values has been shown to be associated with a lower rate of economic growth (Inglehart, 1988). Of course, this may be attributed to other factors, economic or not. Martin (2017) points-out that the decline in growth rates may is the effect of slowdown in productivity growth and lower capacity utilization and Gordon (2018) suggests the critical role of demographic factors, declining labor force participation and rising inequality. However, this article focus on the critical role of the cultural background on the slowdown of economic growth.====The scope of the present paper is twofold. Firstly, the analysis attempts to highlight theoretically and empirically the cultural backlash hypothesis which regards the developed economies of the western world in recent decades. Secondly, the present paper seeks to examine the way the prevalence of traditional / materialistic or post-materialistic values is linked (positively or negatively) to economic growth. In this direction, there is examined the impact of the cultural background on economic growth over an entire period of four decades (1981–2019) which is one of the novelties of the paper. For this purpose, a broad definition of the cultural background is used, defined by the cultural values of generalized trust, respect, independence, work ethic, competition affinity, religion, and trust in political institutions. These values make it possible to classify the cultural background of the countries included in the analysis as traditional/materialistic or post-materialistic, based on Inglehart and Baker (2000). The analysis of the paper is based on a sample of 34 OECD countries. Through the empirical analysis there is proven the prevalence of traditional / materialistic values for the period 1981–1998 and post-materialistic values for the period 1999–2019 which shows the cultural backlash that has occurred in the economies under consideration over the last 40 years. Moreover, the analysis also concludes on a positive effect of cultural background on economic growth when traditional / materialistic values prevail, and a negative effect when post-materialistic values prevail.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review on the change of the cultural background, while Section 3 presents a literature review on the effects of cultural background on economic growth. Section 4 describes the data and method used in the empirical analysis, and Section 5 presents the empirical results.

We focus on enterprises operating in the production of electricity sector in the EU countries and analyse their profitability conditioning on the level of electricity prices. We reveal that SOEs underperform as compared to their privately owned counterparts when they operate in those markets that have lower prices. This suggests that their profitability is likely to be substantially affected by pursuing goals other than profit-maximisation - providing crucial products and services at affordable prices - and emphasises a need to consider the non-commercial objectives of SOEs in the empirical research.,"The conventional wisdom is that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) financially underperform as compared to their private counterparts. There are many reasons for this possible financial underperformance, including agency problems, lack of well-defined groups of monitoring, soft budget constraints, the employment of SOEs as ‘political goods’ and cronyism. Nevertheless, in the literature, it is also argued that the financial underperformance of SOEs might be caused by the fact that they fulfil a wider set of goals than privately-owned enterprises (POEs), including goals other than profit-maximisation, which has a negative impact on their profitability but is socially desirable. Despite the broadly discussed importance of the non-commercial aims of enterprises owned by the state, this field is still a neglected aspect in the empirical analyses of state ownership. We contribute to the literature on state ownership by analysing the relationship between the non-commercial goal of providing crucial services at affordable prices and the relative financial performance of SOEs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining explicitly the price levels as a conditioning factor of SOE profitability (as compared to POEs).====We employ data for enterprises that operate in the production of electricity sector in the EU countries over the period 2007 and 2016. This allows us to use data on the prices of a highly standardised product, that is, electricity, in a sector in which SOEs and POEs compete on an equal basis across countries that share common supranational sectoral regulations. At the same time, the EU policies are explicitly neutral on the ownership structure of enterprises, and the level of state involvement through enterprises in this sector varies substantially between the EU countries (Florio, 2013a; European Commission, 2016).====The econometric analysis with the random effects model employing the Driscoll and Kraay cross-sectional correlation robust standard errors (Driscoll and Kraay, 1998) shows that SOEs had substantially lower profitability than POEs. By introducing the interaction terms between the ownership status and prices, we revealed that SOEs were characterised by lower profitability than POEs in those markets that have lower prices and there were no substantial differences in terms of financial performance between SOEs and POEs at higher price levels. Analysis of these results indicates that the most plausible explanation for this performance difference is the fact that state-owned enterprises fulfil the non-commercial goal of providing crucial services at affordable prices, which strongly emphasises the need to focus on a broader set of objectives than only financial ones in empirical analyses of state ownership in enterprises. This conclusion is not based on a direct test of the proposition, since no company-level electricity price data for such a broad set of countries is available. The test is indirect and, first, builds on the theoretical literature that underlines the role of the non-commercial goals of SOEs and the empirical literature at the macroeconomic level which shows that the presence of state-owned enterprises in the electricity sector is associated with lower prices; second, it checks whether there are substantial differences in financial performance between SOEs and POEs in the production of electricity sector in the EU countries; and finally, it examines whether apparent financial underperformance of SOEs is associated with price levels (collected at the country-level).====Discussion on the role of the state as an owner of enterprises is an important part of the economic discourse as state-owned enterprises still play a substantial role in the world economy—282 out of the 2000 largest publicly listed companies worldwide were state-owned in the years 2012–2013 (Christiansen and Kim, 2014) and SOEs accounted for more than 20% of very large enterprises in terms of total assets over the period 2007–2016 in 19 out of 30 European countries analysed by Szarzec et al. (2021). State ownership seems to be persistent despite the privatisation processes that were started in many developed and post-socialist countries in the 1980s and 1990s (Guislain, 1997; Roland, 2000; Megginson and Netter, 2001; Bortolotti et al., 2004). In the EU countries, state-owned enterprises play a particularly important role in the network industries in which they are often used to support the security of supply, long-term investments and social affordability (Florio, 2013a, 2013b).====The remainder of this article is organised as follows.

Using a geo-coded disaggregated dataset and exploiting within-country variation in slave trade intensity, we document a robust positive relationship between slave exports and contemporary conflict; the slave trade has long-lasting impacts on ethnic conflict and riots in particular. We examine the mechanisms underlying this persistence and find that the slave trade has weakened national identity, leading to a higher risk of ethnic conflict, and has also undermined economic development, which partly explains the relationship between the slave trade and riots. Furthermore, using the individual attitudes from the Afrobarometer survey, we show that the impact of the slave trade on national identity is mostly attributed to the inherited beliefs and norms rather than the external environment.","Political violence has been widely studied in African economic development because of its prevalence in Africa. According to the Armed Conflict Database, African countries are, on average, 1.7 times more likely to have at least 1000 battle-related deaths per year than countries in the rest of the world. Most of the violent events occur in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) ,==== which illustrates the significance of understanding the causes of violence in SSA.====In this article, we examine the effects of the slave trade on contemporary political violence in SSA. The slave trade is one of the most significant historical events in Africa, and it has resulted in many socioeconomic problems (see the detailed discussion in Section 2). We employ a pre-colonial African ethnicity map (Murdock 1959) and ethnicity-level slave trade data from Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) to empirically investigate subnational variation in the number of slaves exported from SSA from 1400 to 1900, to determine the relationship between exposure to the slave trade and the current intensity of political violence. The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation shows that the ethnic homelands that experienced more slave exports are more prone to current political violence. This relationship is robust to a range of subnational controls from geographic characteristics to historical confounders. The results are also supported by the sensitivity analysis developed by Altonji et al. (2005) and Oster (2019).====We further pursue an instrumental variable (IV) approach to examine whether this relationship is causal. Our instrument for the slave trade is the distance from each ethnic homeland's centroid to the closest point along the coastline. The distance to the coast is correlated with the cost of slave exports but plausibly uncorrelated with other characteristics that may affect contemporary violence. The IV estimates report a positive and highly significant effect of the slave trade on political violence.====To mitigate concerns related to exclusion restrictions, we conduct a falsification test. If the exclusion restriction assumption is satisfied, then the reduced-form relationship between the instrument and the intensity of political violence should be insignificant in areas unaffected by the slave trade; otherwise, it suggests that the instrument may affect violence not just through the slave trade. We show that in Northern African areas where slaves were not shipped via the transatlantic and Indian Ocean trade routes (that is, the intensity of slave exports relates to distance from the coast), the reduced-form relationship is statistically insignificant. We also undertake a similar falsification test investigating the reduced-form relationship within Asia, again yielding insignificant estimates. Furthermore, we relax the perfect exclusion restriction assumption and allow the instrument to directly affect the outcome variable in the second stage of the IV regression, by using a Bayesian method introduced by Conley et al. (2012). We find that the direct effect of the instrument on political violence should comprise half of the overall effect to render our IV results insignificant, which is considered unlikely. Finally, we show that our results are robust to the selection of alternative samples and measures for key variables.====To understand the mechanisms through which the slave trade has affected contemporary violence, we investigate the heterogeneous effects of the slave trade on various types of violence. We disaggregate political violence into five subcategories: civil conflict, riot, political militia conflict, ethnic conflict, and violence against civilians. Relative to other types of violence, our results show that the slave trade substantially increases the likelihood of riot and ethnic conflict. These results can be understood in the context of slave trade history. Due to increasing demand for slaves from Europeans, certain tribes invaded neighboring ethnic homelands to capture slaves, and even capture the co-ethnics to meet the demand. As such, ethnic groups with greater exposure to the slave trade in the history tend to distrust the authorities and other ethnic groups, resulting in the seeds of violence.====We then focus on the mechanisms for riot and ethnic conflict. First, the modernization theory suggests that economic development plays a crucial role in mitigating conflict. The nighttime luminosity from satellite images in 1996 accounts for contemporary economic development at the subnational level. Our findings document a significant mediating effect of economic development on the relationship between the slave trade and riot. Second, in line with recent studies discussing how historical legacies shape individuals’ sense of national identity (Ali et al., 2018; Besley and Reynal-Querol 2014; Rohner et al., 2013), we introduce the hypothesis that slave trading may trigger ethnic conflict by weakening national identity. We test this hypothesis using data from the 6th round Afrobarometer survey (2013–2014), which asked African people about their attitudes toward national/ethnic identity. The empirical results indicate that a lack of national identity can largely explain the relationship between the slave trade and ethnic conflict.====Furthermore, we distinguish between the effects of the slave trade on national identity working through inherited factors (intergenerational transmission of beliefs and norms) or external environment (e.g., deteriorated local institutions). We undertake several exercises to examine the relative importance of the internal and external channels. First, we document that the more individuals’ ancestors were affected by the slave trade, the less they now attach their identity to their country. Second, we also show that this relationship is robust to including a set of controls, such as historical and modern conflict, mistrust, intra-group diversity, and indicators for local institutions’ quality. Third, we exploit the fact that internal factors are more geographically mobile than external factors. Therefore, we alternatively measure an individual's exposure to the slave trade by location-based slave exports, i.e., the number of slaves taken from the country-ethnic region in which the individual is currently living. The location-based slave trade intensity intends to reflect the impact of the slave trade on where respondents now live, not on their ancestors. Our estimates demonstrate that the slave trade primarily affected national identity through the internal channel rather than the external environment.",The long-term effects of the slave trade on political violence in Sub-Saharan Africa,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596721000184,15 March 2021,2021,Research Article,112.0

We show that variation is explain by the baseline probability of having a challenger and the number of donations per electoral race. That variation, in turn, is not well explained by observable formal electoral institutions.","The practice of electing judges is a distinctly American phenomenon (Shugerman, 2012). One argument in its favor is that it promotes policy congruence between judge and voter preferences, holding judges accountable to the public. A counter-argument is that policy congruence may not be desirable for its own sake since judicial decisions are meant to be based solely on the facts and the law (Kessler and Piehl, 1998). Furthermore, there is a concern that judicial elections may create inconsistent – and therefore unfair – sentencing behavior if judges give more weight to voter preferences or special interest groups closer to elections. This concern was evident when the Supreme Court ruled (in Williams-Yulee vs. Florida Bar, 575 U.S.) that states could prohibit judges from soliciting funds for their election campaign. Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion of that ruling that “judges are not politicians, even when they come to the bench by way of the ballot. A state may assure its people that judges will apply the law without fear or favor, and without having personally asked anyone for money.”====The potential pitfalls of electing judges have motivated a body of empirical research that studies whether judges pass more punitive sentences when they are up for re-election. This hypothesis emerges from signaling models where voters have preferences for longer sentences than judges, especially for severe crimes like murder or rape. There are a number of studies that find evidence of precisely such electoral sentencing cycles, specifically in Pennsylvania (Huber and Gordon, 2004), Washington (Berdejó and Yuchtman, 2013), North Carolina (Boston and Silveira, 2019, Abrams et al., 2019a), and Kansas (Gordon and Huber, 2007, Park, 2017).==== Each of the aforementioned studies focuses on a single state in great detail. In contrast, we take a different approach by combining sentencing data that we collected from 10 different states (Pennsylvania, Washington, North Carolina, plus Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Virginia). These data are described in detail in Section 2.====In Section 3, we analyze each state’s electoral cycles separately, and strongly confirm the presence of electoral sentencing cycles in those states considered in the existing literature (i.e., Pennsylvania, Washington, and North Carolina).==== Among the other states, however, the evidence is decidedly mixed and no other state displays statistically significant cycles. In Virginia, which forms a quasi-placebo as the one state in our data with purely appointed judges, sentencing cycle are actually negative, though insignificant.====This novel fact of heterogeneity in the presence of electoral sentencing cycles across U.S. states is important in part because sentencing cycles have so far often been viewed and discussed as being a pervasive feature of the U.S. judicial system.==== This heterogeneity pattern is robust to an array of different specifications, including different approaches to inference, variations in how to control for sentencing guidelines, and recidivism, and to adding acquittals to the data. There is also heterogeneity across states in the direction and strength of racial differences in sentencing cycles, as we find qualitatively more pronounced sentencing cycle for whites in some states.==== Other patterns found in previous research, e.g., gender and race biases, and a strong effect of recidivism show up consistently across all states in the data.====It is natural to ask what explains the heterogeneity in the presence of electoral sentencing cycles. In Section 4, We consider two broad explanations. First, heterogeneity in electoral sentencing cycles might be explained by variation in formal rules governing judge elections: judges can be chosen through non-partisan elections (with potentially many challengers), partisan elections, retention elections (where incumbents face only a confirmation vote and no challenger),==== or – in the case of Virginia – by appointment and re-appointment. Second, heterogeneity in electoral sentencing cycles might be explained by the observed level of competitiveness of judicial elections, insofar as this is unexplained by the formal electoral rules. We measure competitiveness in two ways, either as the average number of donors who contributed to a judge’s electoral campaign (Bonica, 2016), or as the share of judicial elections in which incumbents face at least one challenger. We hypothesize that these two measures capture local informal norms regarding how acceptable it is to challenge a judge at the election.====In pooled regressions, there is some evidence that states with partisan elections exhibit stronger estimated sentencing cycles, as well as some evidence that political donor activity correlate with stronger estimated sentencing cycles. However, by far the most significant predictor of sentencing cycles is whether the incumbent was being challenged at all.====Our paper contributes to the literature on judge behavior and court sentencing (Posner, 2008, Epstein et al., 2013, Cohen and Yang, 2019), and specifically builds on and expands the aforementioned work on electoral sentencing cycles.==== Our first core finding – the heterogeneity in electoral sentencing cycles across U.S. states – enriches previous findings and opens avenues for future research in this literature. Our second core finding – that the strength of electoral sentencing cycles is a function of the underlying degree of electoral competition in judicial elections – provides evidence for the previously postulated mechanism that electoral cycles exist because judges internalize their voters’ views more when they seek re-election. This finding also resonates with a broader literature showing that electoral accountability impacts the choices of elected officials (Tabellini and Persson, 2000, Besley and Burgess, 2002, Besley, 2006, Besley and Prat, 2006, Ferraz and Finan, 2008, Bobonis et al., 2016).====Our paper also contributes to the literature on the effect of cultural norms on sentencing outcomes. Abrams et al. (2019b) find that judges moving within counties of their judicial district in Northern Carolina are more likely to adopt local sentencing norms over time. Ash and Poyker (2019) show that counties with elected judges react to changes in voters’ attitudes toward drug-related crimes due to slant media resulting in longer sentencing for drug offenses. We contribute to this literature by showing that counties, where challenging incumbent judges are more accepted, have stronger electoral cycles than those where it is not socially acceptable to challenge judges (i.e., making elections less competitive).====In Section 5, we discuss avenues for future research to explore the root cause of our second core finding: why are incumbent judges rarely challenged at all in some states but frequently challenged in others? Lastly, we revisit our opening paragraph to more broadly discuss how our findings speak to the trade-offs inherent in electing versus appointing local public officials.",Rules versus norms: How formal and informal institutions shape judicial sentencing cycles,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596721000159,8 March 2021,2021,Research Article,113.0

The mandate of the European Commission includes the maintenance and strengthening of ====, and as such it may discipline any Member States that undermine the single market. Relying on an original database covering all state aid applications with rulings between 2000 and 2017, we show that, on the one hand, the Commission tends to reject programs originating from countries that are resistant to EU integration, which is proxied by the transposition deficit. On the other hand, when firms or national governments appeal the decisions made by the Commission, the reversal of the Commission's rejection decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union is positively correlated with the transposition deficit. This evidence suggests that while the Commission is biased against countries with greater resistance to integration, the Court corrects this bias since its mandate is to guarantee the rule of law in the EU system of governance. We argue that these revealed policy preferences are consistent with the assumption that these two bodies attempt to strengthen their legitimacy by making decisions in line with their mandates. Moreover, the interaction between these twin pursuits of legitimacy reinforces the overall legitimacy of the Union, suggesting another driver of evolution in an equilibrium approach of institutions.","The European Union was initially designed to be a confederation whose goals included the establishment of an internal market in which people, labor and capital would flow freely. The single market was aimed at triggering further political integration. This objective has been acceptable to nation-states and their citizens since, at first blush, it promises economic benefits without requiring too great a loss of sovereignty. The EU treaties were very careful in delineating the powers conferred to the EU and the Member States, as the Union aimed to preserve the latter's sovereignty. The authority granted to each level of government might, however, be subject to interpretation and could evolve over time. Such ambiguities may lead to conflicts between European institutions and Member States, even if the main policy decisions are voted by representatives of national governments and are implemented by national public administrations.==== The Member States tend to have a complex relationship with the EU system of government. On the one hand, the substantial benefits of European integration in terms of wealth and global political influence may make Member States more likely to compromise. On the other hand, national politicians and voters would like to minimize the costs incurred by adapting their national 'social contracts', which can lead to slowness in implementing reforms and imperfect compliance with EU commitments. This resistance to integration can also be caused by differences in the endowments of the various socioeconomic groups and local communities, which lead to imbalances in the distribution of the costs and benefits of integration within each Member State.====It is not an overstatement to say that at the heart of the European Union lies a fundamental conflict between the objectives of the European Commission and those of the Member States. Moreover, no clear solution to this conflict appears to exist at present. The mandate of the Commission is to build a more integrated Europe through policies that mainly aim to promote the single market. National governments and parliaments, however, respond to their fellow citizens, to whom they are accountable. While EU and national objectives are aligned in principle, at least in a long-run perspective, voters tend to be more short-sighted and care mainly about their own personal and local interests. They may not believe that the long-term benefits of integration offset the short-term cost of adaptation. Moreover, since the leveling of the playing field creates winners and losers, the latter might form coalitions to resist integration. These considerations lead national political systems (i.e. politicians and public bureaucracies) to take action to protect these interest groups against integration, which may be more palatable than managing active redistribution and supporting those who have to adapt. These divergences between 'national' (and sub-national) interests are the ==== of the European Institutions. They exist to tie the hands of national governments facing such dilemmas of collective action. If interests were aligned at every level, there would be no need for central and federal levels of government in the first place, and the best outcome would be achieved for all parties.====The clash of objectives is well illustrated by state aid control, which is a part of EU competition policy. Competition policy is the most effective tool granted to the Commission, whose mandate is to remove barriers to trade and market protections. National governments have agreed to relinquish sovereignty in this matter since it is essential to building the single market and enjoying the putative benefits of larger, more open markets, including greater scale for producers, supply-side incentives, easier entry for innovators, and higher quality and lower prices for customers. National and sub-national governments retain control over many other dimensions of public policies that are considered to be crucial dimensions of sovereignty, such as choice of energy mix, organization of transportation systems, regulation of utilities, and regional development. This results in numerous biases that hinder further economic integration and has led the Member States to give authority to the Commission to check whether 'state aids' – i.e. any subsidy in the form of grants or tax cuts offered to investors and businesses – create unfair competitive conditions. Each Member State is eager to support its own industries or specific local interests, but such aid could tilt the playing field and thus go against the principle of the European single market and related fair competitive conditions. State aids are thus not allowed by the Commission. However, major categories of exemptions include support for cultural activities, recession-hit industries, local employment, or social and territorial cohesion. The right to obtain an exemption is not crystal-clear and every case, from earmarked support to a predefined program, has to be submitted to the Commission, which may or may not approve it. The Commission clearly benefits from discretionary power in making these decisions and is likely to forbid or reshape any aid that tilts the level playing field. While the Commission does have the benefit of alternative levers to bargain with national and sub-national governments (such as the management of 'structural funds'), it may rely on its authority to approve state aids to achieve certain political aims.====The exercise of the Commission's authority is, however, checked by the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereafter, the Court), which was established to ensure that the Commission decisions are in line with European treaties and laws. The Court is not a political instrument of national governments to resist the policies of the Commission. Rather, it was established as a credible court of justice, and the appointed judges have strong career incentives to establish their reputation as independent and skilled judges that uphold due process and the rule of law.====The European Commission was established with a clear mandate to advance harmonization and integration among the Member States. It is designed as a trustee and not simply an agent of its stakeholders (Majone, 2001). The authority granted to the Commission by the Member States allows it to impose decisions on the latter regarding the implementation of the European treaties. This trusteeship system results from the need for Member States to credibly commit to the integration. The Commission's mandate thus includes promoting integration, which in practice amounts to an extension of authority over national sovereignty. The Commissioners therefore tend to be driven by their ability to show to their peers (the politicians and top-tier bureaucrats in the system of transnational governance) their ability to navigate the complex political environment of the EU political game, which is characterized by persisting tension between national (sometimes local) interests and the mandate to build a stronger Union. , The Court and its judges, on their end, have incentives to demonstrate and grow their credibility in establishing and guaranteeing the rule of law. Thus, while the Commission seeks to expand its authority over the Member States, the Court corrects any infringements of the latter's rights. These back-and-forth interactions, together with the Member States, drive changes in the institutional equilibrium within the European Union.==== This may, therefore, represent a virtuous loop: bit by bit, the Commission might succeed in expanding its power and the Court might reinforce its independence.====These interactions could reinforce the legitimacy of both organizations, resulting in a stronger, more credible EU institutional framework. The above-described dynamics might partly be unintentional. When Robert Schuman launched the process that led to the establishment of the European Union, his idea was to make war not only unthinkable but also materially impossible. More than 60 years after the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community led to additional dialogue and closer relations among European countries, the European Union has evolved and reached a level of complexity that could not have been foreseen at the outset. While complete success may still take many years to achieve, it has undoubtedly laid the foundations of stable and strong institutions. The fact that it remains a system of government under development also makes it a stimulating environment to study the decision-making process and its institutional dynamics. Despite their careful design and implementation, institutional systems will not necessarily perform as envisaged by those who crafted and implemented them. Competition between the different components of a power system offers some insight into the creation and performance of political and economic institutions (Weingast, 2018), as does the dynamic through which their legitimacy is progressively established. Greif and Rubin (2014) aptly address the latter in their discussion of endogenous political legitimacy. Henry VIII of England empowered the parliament, which limited his political discretion, though he in turn, benefited from the legitimacy provided by Parliament's recognition of the British Crown. The power of Parliament gradually encroached on that of the Crown and even dethroned two kings, in 1640 and 1688. While certainly unplanned by the Tudor dynasty, this development contributed to the construction of arguably the most stable and successful constitutional monarchy in world history.====In this paper, we use state aid cases to explore whether a similar dynamic is currently at play in the EU. Indeed, any overreaching by the Commission relative to the sovereignty of the Member States should be halted by the Court. Fair and independent judgments have gradually established the Court as a respectful arbitrator. Meanwhile, any green light by the Court establishes the Commission's status as the legitimate leader of European integration. European institutions might thus be built through the repeated interactions between the Commission, the Court, the Member States, and the private sector. Given its mandate to promote economic integration, the Commission should be more resolute in dealing with those Member States who are less open to European integration. Conversely, the European Court of Justice should correct any bias in the Commission's decisions when they do not comply with EU law.====It is important to note that these interactions do not occur only among politicians such as EU commissioners, national heads of governments or regional/municipal leaders. Public bureaucracies play a strong role in the process of state aid decisions, which are highly technical matters: in practice, these are sophisticated funding schemes where it is necessary to assess the extent to which they hinder competition and whether the resulting costs are justified by the collective benefits (e.g. positive externalities). Moreover, any accompanying measures aimed at mitigating the potential negative effects of a given aid must also be considered. Detailed application files are thus prepared by national authorities and reviewed by the EU bureaucracy in Brussels. The incentives of civil servants on both sides are important, as it might be expected that bureaucrats take their organization's interests into account. In a Weberian logic, career concerns matter, as does the ethos developed in organizations dominated by long-term, if not lifetime, employment. At the national and sub-national levels, bureaucrats tend to consider the possibility of pressure from citizens and interest groups, as their work is mediated by politicians, lobbies and all kinds of veto players that might form coalitions to hinder the power and the discretion of the public bureaucracy if it does not align with their preferences. National and sub-national bureaucracies have the additional incentive of not wishing to be overshadowed by the EU bureaucracy as policy implementers. EU institutions, for their part, are populated by bureaucrats that have a clear interest in strengthening the EU system of power and its political legitimacy. Thus, even if state aid files are technical cases dealt with by technocrats, the latter have incentives to consider the political climate beyond the technical aspects; even if bureaucratic legitimacy derives from the skillful and impersonal management of procedures and files.====The same principles come into play when considering the decisions made by judges at the court level. Career concerns lead judges to stick to their mandate of judging impartially based on the evidence and the law. Unlike EU and national bureaucrats, they have strong incentives to ignore the political context in which state aid schemes are elaborated and approved or rejected in Brussels.====Empirical study of this dynamic is challenging. First, no systematic database is available to analyze the decisions of both the Commission and the Court. Second, the decision-making processes at work in individual cases are not always the same. State aid decisions can be reversed at different steps and it takes substantial effort to track the timeline of each case. Finally, establishing connections between the Commission's verdicts on state aids and their judicial reviews by the Court is not a straightforward task. In this study, we construct, to the best of our ability, a complete data set covering all state aid applications approved or rejected by the Commission from 2000 to 2017. We then rely on a Probit model, where the dependent variable is whether the state aid program is green-lighted, to estimate the conditional probability of approval at the Commission stage.====We find that favorable decisions by the Commission are negatively correlated with transposition deficit, which we use as a proxy for resistance to European integration at the governmental level. Next, we collect the cases appealed to the Court and find that the Court is more likely to reverse rejections of re state aid cases originating from states with a higher transposition deficit. Since the Commission's action precedes that of the Court, this result supports the hypothesis that the Commission is biased against integration-resistant Member States while the Court corrects this bias to a certain extent.====We supplement our analysis by investigating whether Court decisions are influenced by the appellants’ characteristics. However, neither the ’nationality’ of the grant nor the economic strength of the grantee significantly explains their likelihood of success, suggesting that the Court is sufficiently independent when rendering judgments.====The paper proceeds as follows. We examine the dynamics of institutions as explained by a game among various stakeholders and discuss how this can be applied to understanding EU institution building in Section 2. We provide an overview of the mechanism of state aid control in the European Union and the roles of the different players involved in this game in Section 3. A description of the data and the regression results follow in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. We discuss the results and their policy implications in Section 6 and then offer some final remarks in the Conclusion.","The dynamics of institution building: State aids, the European commission, and the court of justice of the European Union",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759672100007X,3 March 2021,2021,Research Article,114.0

We explore the implications of this shift in terms of wage dynamics. Our characterization is based on the estimation of informal pay gaps at the mean and along the wage distribution, relying on the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey for 2003–2017. Our approach comprises three original features: we rely on ","The Russian economy, which had been growing by an average of more than 7% a year in the previous decade, has suffered from the Great Recession, with a fall in GDP of 7.9% in 2009. Some years later, economic sanctions and low oil prices have led to a new episode of recession (the GDP went down by 3.7% in 2015 and real disposable income fell by 10%). These events hardly show up in terms of unemployment: unemployment rates have experienced a long-term decline from 10.6% in 2000 to a 5%–6% since 2012, with only short and moderate increases in the wake of the crisis (7%–8% in 2009–10). In addition to adjustments in wages and hours of work, these trends are explained by the role of informal work as a buffer to a deteriorated economic situation (Gimpelson and Kapeliushnikov, 2015). For the standards of industrialized countries, informality in Russia was already high before the crisis: the country counted more than 15 million informal workers in a labor force oscillating between 70 and 76 million workers over the past two decades (Russian Federal Service for State Statistics, Rosstat).====These recent trends therefore raise questions about the evolution of the informal sector and its composition. From a positive point of view, one can imagine that this is an expansion of small -informal- businesses following the 2008–09 crisis, generating additional employment and growth (even if not contributing to fiscal revenues, by definition). A less rosy picture is a possible negative selection into the informal sector, with the least productive workers pushed into precarious forms of informal activity. Despite the attention devoted to recent trends in wage inequality (e.g. Calvo et al., 2015, Dang et al., 2018), little is known about the wage dynamics associated with changes in the sectoral composition of the Russian labor market. Against this background, we suggest an extensive analysis of the informal–formal earnings gap.====We rely on the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE) and its informal employment module for the period 2003–2017. Estimations at the mean may conceal a great variety of situations due to the very heterogeneous nature of the informal sector (and the possible accentuation of this heterogeneity). Estimations at different points of the earnings distribution seem useful and we rely on quantile estimation approaches. We explore additional dimensions of heterogeneity: gender differences in wage gaps, the type of informal work (wage gaps between formal work and informal employment or informal self-employment) as well as time changes (using time-heterogeneous quantile estimates). We address three main limitations that characterize the bulk of the literature on sector wage gaps.====First, omitted variables may affect both earnings levels and selection into a particular sector. Panel estimations in distributional analyses have emerged as an interesting way to reduce this bias (see for instance Hospido and Moral-Benito, 2016, on public–private sector wage gaps). We follow this path using the panel dimension of the RLMS-HSE. It allows controlling for individual fixed effects, which capture workers’ unobserved characteristics and skills. Our estimator of the informal premia/penalties is also more flexible than usual – our fixed effects are quantile-specific – and tractable at the same time.====Then, a common issue found in the literature is that nonlinear estimators with fixed effects potentially suffer from the incidental parameter bias, especially when panels are short. This bias smoothes the true quantile effects, concealing part of the effect heterogeneity and giving the impression that unobserved heterogeneity is explaining most of the earnings variation along the distribution. We avail of 15 years of RLMS-HSE data but this issue may still affect our estimates substantially (see Bargain et al., 2018). While there is hardly any study correcting for the incidental parameter bias in the context of fixed effect quantile estimations, we suggest a simple jackknife correction for our estimator, inspired from Dhaene and Jochmans (2015).====Finally, a contribution of our work is the use of ==== quantile effects. Most of the literature relies on conditional quantile estimations, which lead to a very specific interpretation of the wage gap when panels are used. Indeed, wage penalties or premia at different quantiles are to be understood as pay differentials conditional on the workers’ (time-invariant) fixed effects. These pay differentials then essentially reflect time variation, which is not very informative. Several contributions have suggested ways to estimate unconditional quantiles (Firpo et al., 2009, Chernozhukov et al. (2013) and rare applications have used them to also account for fixed effects in panel estimations (Hospido and Moral-Benito, 2016).====The present contribution suggests the estimation of unconditional quantile effects following Chernozhukov et al. (2013) while accounting for fixed effects and, importantly, without changing the interpretation of the informal wage premia/penalties. In this way, it becomes possible to assess how the informal wage gap varies, at each point of the unconditional wage distribution, when unobserved characteristics are taken into account or not. In other words, the difference between pooled estimations and fixed effect estimations allows us to characterize the extent of negative or positive selection into the informal sector. This can be done all along the (unconditional) distribution as well as at different points in time, for instance before and after the Great Recession.====Results are as follows. We first characterize the complexity of the informal sector by use of quantile estimations of the informal pay gap over the whole period. We distinguish informal salary workers and informal self-employed, eliciting in each case the earning gap relative to formal salary workers. Small informal wage penalties exist among the least productive salary workers (less than 10%), for both men and women, but do not suggest heavily segmented labor markets. The informal self-employment earning gap is basically zero except at the top of the distribution for men, with a modest earning premium in self-employment.====We then address time changes and provide an extensive robustness analysis. Informal pay gaps gradually decline over the period but show only small variation around zero. They turn negative for informal salary work in the recent years. Earnings premia in informal self-employment are observed at the beginning of the period but quickly disappear. Most interestingly, comparisons of estimations with and without individual fixed effects point to a negative selection into informal work in the years 2010s. This trend is especially pronounced in informal salary work and for men, at low and median wage levels. We further characterize the fact that among low-wage workers, there is an acceleration of the transitions from formal to informal work in the last decade for those with below-average individual fixed effects.====These results tend to reflect the shakeout of less productive workers in the formal sector and possibly the role of some of the labor market reforms following the crisis. We discuss the implications of these findings. With a growing share of the labor force in unregulated, less productive activities, the labor reallocation that followed the crisis may contribute to reduce growth and overall productivity. Our results are also consistent with a heterogeneous, two-tiered view of the informal sector in Russia (Gimpelson and Kapeliushnikov, 2015). This picture seems to aggravate: with the low-tier informal sector becoming more of a last resort option, the Russian labor market is increasingly susceptible to exacerbate inequalities in living standards.",Informal pay gaps in good and bad times: Evidence from Russia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596721000147,3 March 2021,2021,Research Article,115.0

Using new data on the regional dispersion of civilian deaths due to massacres in the Sino-Japanese war (1931–1945), we find that local conflict intensity predicts ==== of Chinese corporations three generations later. We further explore the transmission mechanism of collective war memory. Conflict intensity correlates with measures of anti-Japanese sentiments inferred from survey data and it appears to be transmitted both through war dramas in the mass media as well as official commemorations. We also find evidence that the trade-inhibiting effect increases with the time exposed to collective war memory.","This paper studies the long-term impact and transmission mechanisms of historical conflicts on contemporary external trade patterns. We examine a new data set on the geographical distribution of the number of civilian deaths related to Japan’s massacres in the Second Sino-Japanese war (1931–1945).==== Our aim is to link the degree of conflict intensity three generations ago to contemporary economic outcomes, and what is more important, to empirically scrutinize the underlying transmission mechanisms.====The Chinese context offers some unique advantages over previous studies relating historical conflicts to external trade (Blomberg and Hess, 2006, Glick and Taylor, 2010). First, China’s external trade with western countries was greatly reduced after World War II due to cold-war divisions (Morino, 1991) and re-opened its economy slowly after 1970s.==== This interruption in international trade suggests that any current trade pattern should not be a persistent manifestation of initial contemporaneous trade effects. Instead, the transmission has to occur through collective war memory. Interestingly, war memory across regions in China does not converge to a uniform national consensus—underlining the strong cultural diversity within the country.====We find Sino-Japanese conflict intensity predicts current trade patterns with Japan. Using a difference-in-difference methodology, we show that Sino-Japanese war massacres leads to lower regional cumulative trade between 2001–2006 with Japan than with other countries in the same period in a sample of 255 prefecture-level cities. Specifically, conflict intensity causes trade (ordinary trade type) with Japan to decline by 62.95%. This decline translates into a trade loss of 115.8 billion dollars (constant 2000 US$) for the period 2001–2006.====Why are the economic effects of historical conflicts so persistent over three generations? China stopped international trade for decades following the war, yet in normalizing trade relations with other countries, we find activity with Japan to be disproportionately affected. This pattern suggests a causal effect of local collective war memory on economic activity. In 2008, individual surveys conducted in 71 cities confirm that historical conflict intensity predicts stronger anti-Japanese sentiments as measured by a lower willingness to accept a Japanese person as a colleague. Our second contribution is to explore the underlying transmission mechanism of war memory. We show that the intergenerational transmission of war memory is related to mass media contact and local governmental cultural policies. Mass media contact is measured by the frequency of TV dramas on the Sino-Japanese war broadcast in a given area (2011 and 2012 data). We quantify local cultural policy with the number of Sino-Japanese war memorials (constructed primarily in the 1980s), which are mainly financed by local governments and are common places at which local schools, enterprises and governments organize patriotic educational group activities.====We find that both televised war dramas and war memorials correlate with the current biased trade pattern and the proxy for anti-Japanese sentiments. Specifically, these two war memory proxies are positively correlated with historical regional conflict intensity. More importantly, the effects of conflict intensity on external trade and anti-Japanese sentiments vanish while the effects of war dramas and war memorials remain highly significant when they are jointly included in the regression. Quantitatively, war dramas and war memorials together explain 71% of the massacre effect on trade patterns. Historical conflict intensity is also positively correlated with so-called Red Army memorials, which mainly commemorate the history of the Chinese Communist Party. These monuments celebrate general patriotism and relate only indirectly with the Sino-Japanese War. We therefore use “Red Army Memorials” in a placebo test and find no effect of this type of commemoration on trade and individual anti-Japanese sentiments. These results imply that the long-lasting impact of massacres can be attributed to event-specific commemoration rather than general patriotism.====The trade-inhibiting effect varies with the extent to which people are exposed to war memory. We first divide national-level Sino-Japanese war memorials by their construction time, and find that war memorials built before 1980 have the largest negative trade effect, then war memorials built between 1980–2000 have the second largest effect, and the war memorials built after 2000 have only a smaller and insignificant effect. This is consistent with the intuition that people’s perception and behaviors are gradually shaped by culture. Next, we divide war memorials by their location (urban or non-urban), and find that war memorials built in urban areas have a stronger effect as they attract a larger number of visitors than those built in non-urban areas. Last, when we pool all different types of war memorials in the same regression, the war memorials built before 1980 remain to have the largest negative trade effect while the location does not matter anymore. This implies that the time exposed to war memory matters more in the intergenerational transmission of historical conflicts on contemporary trade.====A frequently raised comparison is with Che et al. (2015), which finds that Chinese provinces (a more aggregate level than prefecture-level cities) with higher civilian casualty rate in Sino-Japanese war traded less with Japan in 2001. We show that the transmission mechanism of civilian casualties is also related to mass media contact and local governmental cultural policies: the effect of civilian casualties on external trade vanishes while the effect of mass media contact and local governmental cultural policies remains significant when they are jointly included in the regression, providing further evidence on the underlying transmission mechanism of historical conflicts.====Our results are robust to various tests. First, we show that the negative trade effect of massacres and war memory is not subject to a specific product category, mitigating the concern that, by chance, regions with greater conflict intensity do not produce products that Japan demands or do not demand products that Japan produces. Second, the negative trade effect is not dominated by random yearly shocks, as it remains significant in all years between 2001–2006. Further, we show that it is not the ==== anti-Japanese sentiments that dominate the current biased trade pattern; besides, there is also no correlation between conflict intensity and measures of ==== anti-foreigner sentiments, which could influence massacre distribution and current trade patterns simultaneously. Moreover, we redistribute each of city-level conflict intensity, war dramas and war memorials to Chinese cities randomly for 100 times and find no statistical evidence that our main result is driven by any specification error.====Our work presents a fuller picture of how historical conflicts within a country influence current external trade patterns. Specifically, we present new evidence showing the impact of persistent war memory on economic activity. Our work is closely related to the literature on the persistent impact of historical conflicts on aggregate economic outcomes (Brakman et al., 2004, Keshk et al., 2004, Martin et al., 2008, Martin et al., 2012, Glick and Taylor, 2010, Blattman and Miguel, 2010, Miguel and Roland, 2011, Che et al., 2015, Rohner et al., 2013a, Rohner et al., 2013b, Waldinger, 2016). Further, in considering the transmission mechanisms of historical conflicts, we add to the recent intense discussion on cultural transmission (Algan and Cahuc, 2010, Putterman and Weil, 2010, Bisin and Verdier, 2011, Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011, Voigtländer and Voth, 2012, Alesina et al., 2013, Grosfeld et al., 2013, Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2013, Alesina and Giuliano, 2015, Guiso et al., 2016). Also, the effect of televised war dramas on war memory preservation is related to the literature on how mass media affects individual attitudes (Enikolopov et al., 2011, DellaVigna et al., 2014, Adena et al., 2015). The suggestive causal link between anti-Japanese sentiments and biased trade pattern is in line with Guiso et al. (2009)’s finding that bilateral trust influences economic exchange and Michaels et al. (2010)’s finding that negative attitudes reduce trade. This paper also contributes to the literature on the persistence of the Sino-Japanese conflict (He, 2007, Che et al., 2015, Katz, 2013, Fisman et al., 2014), which is of crucial importance to the stability and economic integration of East Asia. Finally, this paper finds war dramas and memorials could be used as a tool for promoting nationalism, contributing to the literature on wars, political economy, and nation-building (Dell and Querubin, 2018, Fontana et al., 2018, Kansteiner, 2002, Rohner et al., 2013a, Rohner et al., 2013b).====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the historical background of the Sino-Japanese war (1931–1945), along with a description of civilian anti-Japanese sentiments, is provided in Section 2; our data and identification strategy are described in Section 3; empirical results are presented in Section 4; and Section 5 includes robustness checks.

This paper suggests that investing in R&D improves the incumbent's perceived competence among voters. Using a formal model of signaling, survey experiments conducted in the US and Russia, and corroborating cross-country evidence, I demonstrate that investment in R&D improves perceptions of incumbent competence and approval of the government among the citizenry.","Governments have historically had a major hand in science and technology through investment in research and development (R&D) (Savrul and Incekara, 2015), an important determinant of sustained economic growth (Romer, 1990; Aghion and Howitt, 1990; Aghion et al., 1998). From a social welfare standpoint, the rationale for government investment in R&D is clear: many research projects are risky and may require a long-term commitment of resources and infrastructure. As the creator of new knowledge is unlikely to reap all the benefits, the societal benefits of R&D generally exceed its private benefits. Stiglitz (2015) notes that “Knowledge can be viewed as a public good, and the private provision of a public good is essentially never optimal.” Not surprisingly, governments worldwide spend a great deal of money on promoting R&D.====While the normative argument for government involvement in R&D is more or less clear, the positive explanation of its existence is very much less so. Why do political actors who control government resources have incentives to invest in R&D instead of, say, sponsoring voters’ consumption? Studies of economic voting (Cohen and Noll, 1991; Duch and Stevenson, 2006; Fiorina, 1978; Lewis-Beck, 1986; Huber et al., 2012) emphasize that voters care only about recent policy benefits, a shortsightedness that provokes inefficient public policy due to the responsiveness of government policies to citizens’ preferences (Page and Shapiro, 1983). Galiani et al. (2016) provide experimental evidence that voters are especially sensitive to recent economic activity. Vasilyeva and Nye (2013) show that the provision of public goods is closely related to the political competition. However, if electoral rewards for beneficial policy decay rapidly, then reelection pressures induce policymakers to lean toward opportunistic short-term policies, underinvesting in welfare-enhancing policies with benefits that take longer to materialize (Achen and Bartels, 2008; Keech, 1980; Sobel and Leeson, 2006).====In a paper justifying retrospective voting analysis, Key and Cummings (1966) note: “[Voters] are not likely to be attracted in great numbers by promises of the novel or unknown”. Similarly, promises of future good performance are discounted completely in Ferejohn (1986). Yet investment in R&D is unlikely to boost incumbent's popularity from the perspective of retrospective voting either: the fruits of government R&D policy rarely ripen by the time the incumbent stands for re-election. Hibbs (2005) points to the lack of consensus in empirical work on whether prospective voting, retrospective voting, or their mixture, provides the best explanation for voter behavior. But given the importance of recent economic outcomes on reelection probability, why would policymakers spend money on risky long-term projects?====The explanation I offer is that voters consider R&D investment to be a signal of leaders’ competence. While they cannot reap the benefits of these investments before the election, they realize that an incompetent leader, being unable to select proper projects, would be more willing to spend on consumption goods. Voters’ preferences to reelect competent leaders therefore create incentives for R&D investments. Of course, the signaling nature of such investments creates incentives even for an incompetent leader to invest in R&D, as she would want to pool, in equilibrium, with a competent one. In the theoretical model, I analyze conditions under which a separating equilibrium exists; naturally, separation is welfare-enhancing. Then, I investigate the empirical implications of the model using a cross-country data set and survey experiments in the US and Russia.====Both theoretical and empirical investigations of the political foundations of R&D need to take into account the specifics of this type of government activity. First, ==== For example, in medicine, the average time lag between a scientific finding and its implementation is 17 years (Morris et al., 2011). Second, ====, such as infrastructure and education. This, in turn, makes it harder for the incumbent to expect a boost in popularity as a consequence of welfare-promoting policy. By contrast, projects the interim results of which are more visible can help incumbents gain public support even before their completion. For example, in an analysis of construction of the Autobahn network in Nazi Germany, Voigtländer and Voth (2014) show that highway construction was effective in boosting popular support for the government not only through its impact on the economy but also by sending a powerful signal related to the competence of the incumbent responsible for the construction.====The third distinctive feature is that ==== The incumbent elite may fear being deposed by those who are empowered by a new technology, an effect that (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006) terms “political displacement”. In addition, the ruling elite can block new technologies that facilitate the spread of new ideas to maintain its legitimacy (Cosgeletin et al., 2012). Sometimes, governments block innovation in an attempt to shield the established elite from economic losses (Mokyr, 1990, 1992; Milner, 2006). Bussell (2010) shows that politicians might be incentivised to stifle the adoption of technologies that promote transparency in public sector in order to maintain access to rents from corruption. This body of literature makes the political decision to promote innovation an even greater puzzle.====Finally, ====, since knowing whether a certain technology resulting from it will be successful prior to its outcome is at best difficult.====Given the factors that seemingly make investment in R&D unattractive for incumbents, why do governments do so at such high levels and opportunity cost? The observational data from OECD countries and a cross-national opinion survey, suggests that there is a positive correlation between increased government R&D funding and growth of government approval ratings.==== In order to establish a causal effect of politician's choice to promote R&D on assessment of his/her competence by the citizens, I conduct a paired-vignettes survey experiment in the USA, a country that has a robust tradition of government support of R&D, and Russia, where the modern history of government involvement in R&D started, for all practical purposes, a decade ago, in 2008. The results of the experiment suggest that pro-R&D politicians are regarded as more competent than those that prioritize infrastructure or education spending. This to true in the contexts of both democratic politics in the US and authoritarian politics in Russia. Still, there are some significant dissimilarities between the two countries: e.g., in the US, R&D spending raises expectations of competence but not on overall economic performance, while in Russia competence perceptions and economic expectations are highly correlated.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the existing literature.

Especially in the course of the various EU enlargement waves starting in 2004, it was intensively discussed whether institutional and structural homogeneity are necessary preconditions for real convergence and the smooth functioning of the EU or whether a (further) catching up in the institutional and economic development will endogenously occur after the EU accession. Our paper is dedicated to the analysis of these institutional dynamics within the EU. In particular, we analyze the formation of institutional convergence clusters using Phillips and Sul's (2007, 2009) log t-test over the period 2002 to 2018. Our results indicate the existence of multiple institutional clubs with various countries being stuck in a poor institutional trap. Moreover, we find that institutional convergence clubs are formed mainly on the basis of geographic region; in particular, we identify a northwest-southeast divide. When analyzing per capita income clubs, a rather similar picture emerges, suggesting that the underlying institutional clusters might drive the formation of income clubs. We also study the factors that determine institutional club membership by using an ordered ====. Most importantly, we find that the initial levels of human capital and institutional quality are decisive for determining whether a country is on a high or low institutional growth path.","It is by now a well-established knowledge that good institutions are decisive for explaining cross-country differences in economic performance. This literature was coined by the works of North (1981), Hall and Jones (1999), Acemoglu et al. (2001, 2005, 2014), and Rodrik et al. (2004). More recently, empirical studies started to analyze the nature of institutional development, in particular, whether there is institutional convergence or divergence, in order to better understand economic growth processes (Elert and Halvarsson, 2012; Savoia and Sen, 2016; Kar et al., 2019). This literature is of particular relevance for the European Union (EU) since convergence in institutions and in per capita income across the EU Member States are key goals of the European integrations process (cf. Wagner, 2014), as formulated, among others, in the EC Treaty of 1957 which emphasizes the importance to “strengthen the unity of economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured” and also in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty which underlines the relevance of achieving “the strengthening of the convergence of [the EU] economies”. Especially in the course of the Eastern EU enlargement starting in 2004, it was intensively discussed whether institutional and structural homogeneity are necessary preconditions for real convergence and the smooth functioning of the EU or whether a (further) catching up in the institutional and economic development will endogenously occur after the EU accession.====The question of whether there is convergence or divergence in institutions across the EU member states has been analyzed in various empirical contributions (e.g. Schönfelder and Wagner, 2016, 2019; Wagner, 2014; European Central Bank ECB, 2015; Beyaert et al., 2019). There is a general consensus among this literature that, especially more recently, there is a rather divergent trend instead of an institutional rapprochement process. A common feature of these studies is that they are mostly based on some versions of sigma or beta-convergence tests, thus ignoring the possibility of the existence of multiple steady states. The log t-test developed by Phillips and Sul (2007) overcomes these shortcomings and allows distinguishing between various convergence possibilities, including club convergence. While this method is now standard for analyzing economic convergence across countries and regions, including the EU (cf. Bartkowska and Riedl, 2012; Borsi and Metui, 2015), only recently, studies started to exploit the advantages of the Phillips and Sul (2007) method in order to investigate institutional convergence (Kar et al., 2019; Glawe and Wagner, 2019b).====Our study is the first to analyze multiple institutional clubs within the EU. In particular, we examine the institutional development and dynamics across the EU member countries over the period 2002 to 2018 by using Phillips and Sul's (2007) log t-test. We find evidence for multiple equilibria in institutional quality for the dimensions “government effectiveness”, “regulatory quality”, “rule of law”, and “control of corruption” as well as for the mean institutional quality among these four dimensions. Interestingly, our results show that the convergence clubs are formed mainly on the basis of geographic region. In particular, most countries that constitute the high institutional quality clubs are located in Northern and Western Europe whereas the lower institutional clubs consist of Southern and Eastern European countries. Among the countries that joined the EU after 2004, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia perform best, whereas most of the remaining new member countries are found to be stuck in poor institutional traps. The situation is particularly severe for Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Hungary.====In a next step, we study the factors that determine institutional club membership by using an ordered probit model. Most importantly, we find that the initial levels of human capital and institutional quality are decisive for determining whether a country is on a high or low institutional growth path. Moreover, Eurozone membership plays an important role for the formation of the government effectiveness clubs since being a member of the euro area significantly increases the probability of belonging to the high institutional clubs.====Finally, when analyzing per capita income clubs, our results reveal a rather similar picture to that obtained when analyzing institutional dynamics, suggesting that the underlying institutional clusters can determine the formation of income clubs. However, in some cases, we identify a time lag between the transition to a higher institutional equilibrium on the one hand and the breaking out of the bad income equilibrium on the other hand. This applies particularly to some of the New Member States (NMS): Even though Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia manage to converge to the high institutional clubs, they are still stuck in rather low income traps. This finding, however, does not necessarily imply that institutions are not decisive for a sustainable economic catching up process towards high-income status: as suggested by the theory of “second-best institutions” (cf. Rodrik, 2008) it can take some time until the benefits of institutional reforms unfold and improvements in institutional quality translate into economic gains. This delay between institutional convergence and economic convergence is probably one of the reasons why it might be enticing for politicians of developing countries to stop or even reverse reforms. Still, the partly strongly ascending individual transition paths (calculated on the basis of the results of the log t-test analysis) of the three Baltic NMS support the view that in the long-run, having a lot of staying power with respect to the consistent implementation of institutional reforms will most likely pay off in the sense that it enables these countries to join the high income group.====The reminder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 is then dedicated to the identification of institutional clubs in the EU over the period 2002 to 2018 by using the convergence tests developed by Phillips and Sul (2007) (and the extensions of von Lyncker and Thoennessen, 2017). In Sub-Section 3.1, we first describe our data and outline our research methodology. The institutional clubs identified via the log t convergence test are then presented in Sub-Section 3.2. Based on these findings, in Section 4, we analyze the determinants of the club formation process by using an ordered probit model. We again first describe the methodology and data in Sub-Section 4.1 before discussing our main findings in Sub-Section 4.2. Section 5 provides some further discussion of our results from a political economy standpoint. Section 6 then elucidates on the relationship between institutional and income clubs.

Moreover, we find that exporters benefit more from processing experience for larger markets with fiercer competition. Similarly, stronger learning effects are also observed when processing experience is associated with products that embody less diffused knowledge and are more differentiated. Also, firms learn more from processing experience when they are more actively engaged in processing imports. Lastly, we verify the economic significance and quantify the importance of these potential channels.","Processing trade has been a highly active form of international trade in the modern industrial economy. In many developing countries, promoting processing trade has also been an instrumental part of promoting export and overall economic growth.==== For instance, in China, the world’s current largest exporter, processing exports accounted for 55% of its total exports in 2001 and 33% in 2017. Existing literature on processing trade has emphasized the difference between processing exporters (i.e., firms engaging in processing exports) and ordinary exporters (i.e., firms engaging in ordinary exports) in terms of productivity, export performance, investments and what determine the choice between these two exporting forms (Fernandes and Tang, 2015, Dai et al., 2016, Manova and Yu, 2016). These studies agree that it is crucial to distinguish the two types of exporters when analyzing firm-level exporting behavior. A related line of work has studied the behavioral differences between the two types in response to trade liberalization policies, such as import tariff reduction (Tian and Yu, 2015, Yu, 2015, Brandt and Morrow, 2017). However, there is no consensus over the channels through which processing exports promote export growth and economic growth, especially at the firm level (Engman and Farole, 2012). In fact, the existing literature tends to associate a negative image with processing exporters, as they tend to be less productive and have inferior performance in other aspects like wages, R&D, and skill intensity.====In this paper, we focus on exporter dynamics and point to the dynamic and long-term gains from processing export activity. It is commonly agreed that firms participating in the global value chains gain benefits beyond traditional imports and exports through durable firm-to-firm relationships and potential knowledge transfers (World-Bank, 2020). However, existing studies have been mainly focused on the effects on the overall trade. For example, Amiti and Konings, 2007, Goldberg et al., 2010, Lileeva and Trefler, 2010, and Feng et al. (2016), among others, have shown how access to foreign market and the use of imported intermediate inputs enhance firm productivity and (ordinary) export performance. Our work provides important empirical evidence that even ==== to foreign markets/contents through processing export experience can provide firms the opportunities to learn and improve as an ordinary exporter in the future. Previous studies on knowledge transfer in international trade were mainly focused on inter-firm spillover effects of processing export activities, while potential intra-firm spillover effects were largely ignored.==== In this paper, we focus on intra-firm spillovers and provide direct evidence that firms learn from their own processing export experience.====In processing trade, a processing exporter undertakes the assembly stage of certain production(s) off-shored or outsourced by a foreign partner. The processing exporter imports all or part of the raw materials, spare parts, accessories, etc. in bond and re-exports the assembled products.==== While its foreign partner provides product design, manages supply chain logistics and marketing, and sometimes also provides intermediate inputs, which are usually embedded with high quality and/or technology.==== During the process of assembling and managing the timely delivery of outputs, processing exporters expose themselves to market-specific designs of final products, high-quality inputs, organizational forms, and production processes that potentially represent higher productivity. Such processing experience provides firms the opportunity to improve their product appeal and quality, lower the market penetration cost and increase production efficiency for their subsequent ordinary exports. We refer to this intra-firm spillover effect as the “learning-by-processing” effect. In practice, this learning process can vary from firm to firm in terms of absorptive speed and product scope.====Specifically, we examine the effects of firms’ processing export experience on their subsequent ordinary export performance of similar products. Our analysis yields a number of new findings by exploring the rich information from Chinese firm-level production data and transaction-level Customs data from 2000 to 2006. First, we find that processing experience facilitates firms’ subsequent ordinary export performance at both extensive and intensive margins. Firms with processing experience in related products have a significantly increased probability of entering a new ordinary export market (i.e., a product–destination pair). Conditional on entry, firms with processing experience also exhibit larger ordinary export values than those without do. Moreover, we show that firms export products with improved quality after engaging in processing trade. Furthermore, we investigate the potential channels through which firms learn from processing experience and quantify the importance of these channels. We find that firms potentially learn from processing experience to enhance ====, to better understand how to improve ==== to cater to specific markets, and to gain better and easier ====. In addition, we find that exporters benefit more from processing experience for larger markets with fiercer competition. Similarly, stronger learning effects are also observed when processing experience is associated with products that embody less diffused knowledge and are more differentiated. Also, firms learn more from processing experience when they are more actively engaged in processing imports. These findings provide rationales for widely used policies that promote processing trade in spite of its low-profit and low skill-intensity nature in the short term. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first set of results on firm-level learning effects from processing export experience.====To identify the pure impacts of processing export on subsequent ordinary export performance, we control for demand-side factors that affect a firm’s decision and ability to engage in ordinary exporting markets by including product–destination–year fixed effects in our baseline regression. By merging the Customs data with the firm-level production survey data, we also manage to control for supply-side determinants such as a firm’s total factor productivity (TFP), ownership, financial and capacity constraints. In addition, we introduce fixed effects to control for unobserved firm and product–destination–year characteristics. To further isolate the impacts of processing export experience (on ordinary export performance) from that of ordinary export experience, we include the ordinary experience dummy in almost all regressions, with extra controls for potential endogeneity and selection bias. Our results are robust to different sub-samples, and to alternative definitions of both processing experience and ordinary experience.====Our paper complements the literature on processing trade, which has been mainly focused on the differences between ordinary and processing exporters in terms of key characteristics and their responses to trade liberalization.==== We provide a dynamic firm-level analysis that complements the existing studies. Focusing on the linkage between firms’ ordinary and processing export activities, we show that processing experience facilitates firms’ subsequent ordinary exports. We also find “ladder-climbing behavior” from processing exports to ordinary exports. The paper also contributes to the literature on learning-by-exporting. It has been shown that exporting experience can improve firm productivity through the channel of scale economy, by learning from foreign customers and rivals, and by interacting with specific investments like R&D (Biesebroeck, 2005, De Loecker, 2013, Bai et al., 2017, Aw et al., 2011). Exporters can also improve their performance by importing intermediate inputs that embeds advanced technology (Amiti and Konings, 2007, Lileeva and Trefler, 2010, Feng et al., 2016). By utilizing transaction-level trade information at firm–product–destination level, our findings provide evidence that learning-by-exporting is not only limited to firm’s overall productivity improvement, but also on export performance in both product- and destination-dimensions.====In a broader view, our study is related to the line of work that examines spillover effects in international trade. Existing studies are focused on the inter-firm knowledge spillover effects, some of which provide supports for the establishment of export processing zones (Aitken et al., 1997, Keller, 2010, Koenig et al., 2010). Using the same data as ours, Fernandes and Tang (2014) examine whether new (ordinary) exporters can learn from their neighbors about export demand and start exporting new products and/or to new destinations. In their paper and other relevant studies (e.g. Albornoz et al., 2012, Nguyen, 2012 and Berman et al. (2019)), good demand signals can positively affect the probability of entry, while bad signals can deter entry. In our paper, we show that firms benefit from processing experience by accumulating demand-side information like product appeals. Therefore the processing experience benefits are larger among younger or smaller exporters. We also distinguish from Fernandes and Tang (2014) by focusing on within-firm inter-temporal learning effects specifically from processing experience. In addition, our paper complements the more recent studies which specifically examine the imitation behavior of importers and exporters and its effects on firm performance (Cristea, 2011, Li and Liu, 2019, Bisztray et al., 2018). Instead of looking at imitating other firms’ behavior, we focus on within-firm knowledge spillover from foreign inputs usage in processing trade and show evidence of firms imitating their own processing importing behavior in ordinary trade.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide data description and summarize the static and dynamic patterns of different types of exporters. In Section 3, we introduce our baseline empirical strategy and discuss the results. In Section 4, we further investigate possible learning channels. And we conduct a series of robustness checks in Section 5.

Our case study is the German state of Baden-Württemberg. Our empirical findings suggest that rural inheritance traditions were primarily determined by geography. First, fertile soils allowed splitting of the land among siblings for longer and with fewer conflicts, and hence we find more equal partition in areas with higher soil quality, especially at elevation levels conducive to intensive agriculture. Second, geography determined the settlement pattern. Areas that were settled before the Middle Ages, when land was abundant and free, are more likely to apply equal partition today. In areas that were largely uninhabited until the Middle Ages, primogeniture is the norm. We argue that these areas were deforested with the obligation of primogeniture, imposed by feudal lords.","What explains modern agricultural inheritance traditions? Were inheritance practices subject to the “self-induced modernization” of premodern Western Europe (Kuran, 2011 81), or have they been shaped by events far before modernity and persisted ever since?====To address this central issue, our paper poses two questions in relation to the origins of modern inheritance traditions. Which mechanisms shaped the pattern of inheritance traditions we observe today? Do the reasons for today’s pattern lie in the medieval or premodern past, or in the modern era?====Our argument follows a rich economic literature pursuing a “cultural approach” on the origins of institutions (Ogilvie, 2007). Culture here is assumed to be endogenous to its environment. With respect to the transmission of inheritance traditions across generations, we resort to the theoretical framework by Bisin and Verdier (2001). We also follow up on the research by German-speaking and international scholars on how decisions within the family created social, economical, and political variation (e.g., Röhm, 1957, Todd, 1990) in inheritance practices (mainly equal partition and primogeniture). This historical research suggests that the origins of inheritance traditions lie primarily in natural conditions, especially by deciding over the supply of land which allowed intensive agriculture, in opposition to poor soils. The roots of primogeniture trace back to adverse agricultural conditions, but also to the rise of feudal states in the Middle Ages which enforced primogeniture on their serfs to ensure high in-kind tax returns. In our empirical section, we provide variables to explain whether a municipality uses equal partition. Our cross-sectional regressions on the distribution of equal partition within Baden-Württemberg suggest that the inheritance tradition was largely an outcome of geography and settlement history. In particular, our empirical results suggest that equal partition is significantly more likely to occur in areas with better soil quality and lower elevation. Both variables together explain around 16% of the overall variation in inheritance traditions among municipalities in Baden-Württemberg. In further regressions, we show that, in line with the argument of historians, intensive agricultural activities (like wine-growing) are also conducive to the emergence of equal partition. Our results imply a significant role of settlement history. Conditional on geography, areas that were settled during the Neolithic period or by Germanic tribes during late antiquity and the early Middle Ages show a significantly higher probability of equal partition. In contrast, areas that were settled later, in the course of the deforestation efforts of the high Middle Ages, have a significantly lower probability of equal partition.====The maps in Fig. 1 summarize our main argument: The historical equal partition and primogeniture areas can be seen in Panel (a). Panel (b) shows the distribution of soil quality along with the areas that are higher than 500 m above sea level (shaded areas). The comparison of these two panels reveals some analogies, but is far from complete: soil quality or elevation alone cannot fully explain the inheritance pattern. Panel (c) shows the areas that were not settled before the Early Middle Ages in gray. Panels (a) and (c) suggest that later-settled areas apply more primogeniture today. Our results show that a combination of soil quality and elevation on the one hand and settlement history on the other can explain today’s inheritance pattern. This result is in line with historical literature and economic reasoning, and it is statistically significant and robust to controlling for alternative channels and various other statistical sensitivity checks.====There are strong arguments for using German data to investigate into the inheritance traditions, even more for a focus on the state of Baden-Württemberg, with its extraordinary small-scale variation. A map by Todd (1990) shows that all other European countries either have a single norm, or are divided into two regions that are different in many other dimensions.==== ==== From the perspective of variation in outcomes, the equal partition and primogeniture regions have developed in a systematically different way (Hager and Hilbig, 2019, Huning and Wahl, 2019). The development of the German South from a region portrayed as backward (e.g. Weber, 1905) to a role model among German states has provoked ample research in the roots of this catch-up process. As pointed out by Hager and Hilbig (2019) the understanding of inheritance norms is crucial for efficient state intervention (i.e. arranging the tax system or the design of social security systems) by better explaining how these inheritance norms came along in one of the oldest welfare states can therefore guide policy makers elsewhere.====Inheritance is the largest factor in the re-allocation of assets outside of markets. Therefore, in particular, the implications of differences in the details of this allocation have inspired several scholarly traditions. There is a wide literature on the consequences of inheritance tradition on inequality, family structures, gender roles, and economic development (Eigner et al., 2018, Goody et al., 1978, Huning and Wahl, 2019, Kuran, 2011, Menchik, 1980, Hager and Hilbig, 2019). The present paper complements this literature by shedding light on the origins of the inheritance traditions.====We are interested in how rural areas contributed to cultural persistence and change in premodern Europe (Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln, 2007, Bazzi et al., 2020, Giuliano and Nunn, 2020), and how medieval institutions shaped Western institutions to this day (Schulz et al., 2019). To do so, we outline the historical literature on European and German inheritance traditions in Section 2. We link these ideas to the theoretical literature on the origins of institutions, land rights, and their cultural transmission in Section 3. This is followed by the presentation of our data in Section 4. We progress to the empirical sections on the origins of inheritance traditions (Section 5). We discuss the implications of our findings for the literature on the consequences of inheritance traditions in Section 6.

It specifically focuses on recent college graduates in China. By examining firms’ responses to fictitious resumes with randomly generated information on gender and other key attributes of applicants (e.g., school reputation, student's academic achievement, and leadership experiences), this study is able to separate the effect of gender on a student's potential for getting an on-site interview from the confounding effects of other factors. The findings reveal that, with all other factors remaining constant, female applicants, on average, are less likely to be invited by hiring firms to on-site interviews as compared with their male counterparts. Furthermore, gender discrimination in computer and mathematics, architecture and engineering, and sales occupations appears to be driving the results of this study. The qualitative evidence based on interviews with firm recruiters suggests that the findings of this study are generally consistent with the role congruity theory of prejudice in psychology literature. While the finding that the quality of a job candidate (academic achievement and leadership experience) does not reduce gender discrimination offers some evidence to support a taste-based discrimination view, we do not have enough evidence to support a statistical discrimination view.","Gender discrimination is common in China (Fincher 2013; Steinfeld 2014), and it manifests itself in various forms (e.g., discriminatory hiring practices, wage discrepancies, limited promotion opportunities, unfair dismissals, early compulsory retirement ages, and sexual harassment). Approximately 50% of Chinese women have indicated that they experience gender discrimination at their workplaces regularly (Wang 2016), and urban Chinese women earn, on average, only 67% of the wages men earn (All-China Women's Federation 2011). Although China has enacted a series of laws to address these discriminatory practices (i.e., based on its constitutional gender equality principle), these laws have generally been ineffective in combating discrimination against women (Bulger 2000; Han 2001; Yang and Li 2009). Therefore, gender discrimination continues to be pervasive in Chinese society.====Despite the existence of many studies on wage discrepancies between men and women in China (Meng and Miller 1995; (Meng, 1998); Gustafsson and Li 2000; Bishop et al., 2005; Demurger et al., 2007), only a few delve into the subject of gender discrimination in the hiring process. Kuhn and Shen (2013) examined explicit gender discrimination in ads posted on an online Chinese job board. Their results show that (i) only 11% of approximately 1000,000 job ads display a gender preference (while 89% do not) and (ii) gender-targeted job ads favor women as often as men. This implies that gender discrimination mainly exists in the hiring process in China in a subtle and implicit way (Steinfeld 2014). This explains why the majority of studies on employment-based gender discrimination in developed and developing countries have predominately focused on implicit gender discrimination (Kuhn and Shen 2013).====In seeking to understand the reasons behind gender discrimination in the hiring process, existing literature generally offers two alternative explanations: taste-based discrimination and statistical discrimination. The taste-based discrimination theory, pioneered by Becker (1957), argues that employers have a distaste for hiring members of certain groups (e.g., females, blacks, or other minorities). Therefore, employers may refuse to hire certain groups of people because of this distaste, and if they do hire them, they are likely to pay them lesser than other equally productive employees. In contrast, the statistical discrimination theory argues that employers tend to have imperfect information on potential employees’ productivity (Phelps 1972; Arrow 1973; Aigner and Cain 1977). They use group-specific membership to infer potential employees’ productivity. As such, when faced with two applicants having the same unobservable productivity but belonging to two different groups, an employer will rationally favor the applicant belonging to the group with a higher expected productivity, thereby resulting in discrimination.====This paper examines implicit gender discrimination (i.e., against females) in the hiring process involving job-seeking college graduates in China. At this stage, hiring firms solicit job applicants through job fairs and/or online job boards before screening them for on-site interviews. These two channels are the main avenues through which firms hire employees in China. More specifically, this study explores the role of gender in screening and inviting applicants for an on-site job interview. To achieve this, it examines the different responses of firms to male and female college graduate applicants and further discusses the possible mechanisms underlying gender discrimination against females at the initial stage of hiring. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine implicit gender discrimination in the hiring process in China.====To investigate the existence of implicit gender discrimination in the hiring process in China, the authors conducted a correspondence study that examined employers’ responses to randomized, fictitious resumes. The correspondence method was employed because it overcomes both the omitted variable and self-selection biases plagued with the utilization of observational data (Neumark et al., 1996; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004; Petit 2007). The omitted variable bias arises if part of the measured difference in outcome variables is due to unobserved differences between the two groups (unknown to researchers), while the self-selection bias arises if there are different self-censorships in job applications between the two groups (e.g., female college graduates may choose to only apply to prospective employers who are less discriminatory against women). The correspondence method is considered the most rigorous approach to studying gender or racial discrimination in labor markets. Under this method, gender or racial discrimination is assessed by comparing hiring firms’ response rates (whether or not a mock applicant is invited for an on-site interview) to fictitious resumes, wherein applicants’ gender (or race) and other key attributes (such as school background, academic performance, etc.) are randomly created. As the gender and key characteristics are randomly assigned, they are all independent from each other and are uncorrelated with the hiring firms’ characteristics. Therefore, the effect of gender on an applicant's likelihood of receiving an on-site interview can be separated from the confounding effects of other factors. Despite this obvious advantage of the correspondence approach in studying employment-based gender discrimination, the number of studies that have used this method, although growing, is still small.====To conduct a correspondence study, we created identical, fictitious resumes in which gender and several other characteristics (i.e., commonly perceived as important in obtaining a job) were randomly assigned. These fictitious resumes were then submitted to recruiting firms. As such, the omitted variable and selection biases were controlled. The correspondence approach has been employed in a number of studies measuring discrimination by studying employers’ reactions to identical resumes with randomly assigned gender, ethnicity, or race (e.g., Levinson 1975; Riach and Rich 1987; Neumark et al., 1996; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004; Riach and Rich 2006; Booth and Leigh 2010; Edelman et al., 2017; Chen 2020; Hou et al., 2020).====Our study yields several important findings. First, with all factors remaining constant, female (vs==== male) applicants, on average, receive fewer callbacks from hiring firms. More precisely, the probability of a female applicant obtaining an on-site interview is only about two-thirds that of a male applicant. This means that a female applicant, on average, will have to submit 55% more applications to receive the same number of callbacks. Second, a high level of academic achievement of a female applicant (e.g., excellence in academic performance, student leadership, and strong English skills) does not narrow the gender disparity in hiring. This implies that hiring firms do not compromise their gender preference even when faced with a high level of achievement of a female applicant. Third, gender disparity appears to be heterogeneous across firm sizes, ownership types, industries, and occupations. Private firms and relatively large firms (i.e., with more than 100 employees) tend to prefer male applicants; however, there is no statistically significant gender disparity for other types of firm ownerships and relatively small firms (i.e., those with less than 100 employees). Gender disparity is the most striking among industries such as the manufacturing, wholesale and retail trades, information technology, and to a lesser degree, leasing and commercial services.====This study further explored the possible mechanisms underlying the gender discrimination results. The findings revealed that for computer and mathematics, architecture and engineering, and sales occupations, females are, on average, less likely to receive callbacks, with all other factors remaining constant. These three occupations account for 43% of the total sample. As such, they appear to be driving this study's findings that females are discriminated against in receiving callbacks based on the full sample. Other main occupations do not show such high levels of discrimination against females. To further reveal the underlying reasons for gender discrimination, we conducted a qualitative analysis by interviewing 20 firm recruiters. The interview results revealed that recruiters perceive the existence of incongruity between the requirements for these occupations and the stereotyped roles of women. As a result, female applicants are less likely to be recruited for these occupations. These findings are in fact consistent with the role congruity theory of prejudice in psychology literature (Eagly and Karau 2002; Eagly and Carli 2003; Koenig and Eagly 2014). While this study offers some evidence to support a taste-based discrimination view, we do not have enough evidence to support a statistical discrimination view.====Literature on gender discrimination tends to focus on developed countries and finds that gender and racial discriminations are widespread in developed countries (in the U.S.: Levinson 1975; Neumark et al., 1996; in Australia: Riach and Rich 1987; Booth and Leigh2010; in England: Riach and Rich 2006). However, even though gender discrimination in developing (vs. developed) countries is more pronounced, very few studies, especially those that have adopted the correspondence method approach, have examined how gender discrimination affects job applicants in developing countries. In this respect, this study makes an important contribution to the gender discrimination literature, as it is the first study to use the correspondence method to ascertain gender discrimination in hiring in the Chinese job market and also one of the very few such studies focusing on developing countries.====Kuhn and Shen (2013) studied explicit gender discrimination in the hiring process in China. They find that although it is legal to express gender preferences in job ads, the share of ads favoring men versus those favoring women is roughly equal. They further find that as job skill requirements increase, the share of ads stipulating a preferred gender decreases. Kuhn and Shen also show that despite firms’ idiosyncratic gender preferences for particular jobs, a firm's gender preferences can be overridden by factors such as a thinner labor market or a greater incentive to search broadly for the best candidate. However, our study differs from Kuhn and Shen's (2013) study in several ways. First, their study specifically explores explicit gender discrimination in the Chinese labor market, while our study examines implicit gender discrimination during the early hiring stage. Our study finds that even in an environment where it is legal to express gender preferences in hiring, female applicants are discriminated against for job positions that do not specify gender preference and do not necessarily require gender-specific skills. Second, our study finds that there is a systematic implicit discrimination against female applicants, while Kuhn and Shen (2013) do not find a systematic explicit discrimination against a particular gender. Third, our study suggests possible mechanisms underlying the systematic implicit discrimination against female applicants, while Kuhn and Shen's study does not seek to explain explicit discrimination against a particular gender. Instead, they seek to understand why the frequency of the explicit gender requirement appearing in job ads (female or male gender) may vary in contrary to the job's skill requirement. In summary, although both the studies explore gender discrimination in the labor market, the phenomena the two studies seek to understand and explain differ.====This paper is organized as follows.

Using China's 1986 Compulsory Education Law, which established a new nationally uniform age threshold for primary school enrolment as a natural experiment, we find that the probability of attending high school falls by 3.6 percentage points when school enrolment is postponed by one year. We provide suggestive evidence that those who start school later are not better learners, and that older students' higher labor opportunity cost plays an important role in explaining the negative impact of school entry age on educational attainment.","A large extant literature examines the relationship between the starting age of primary schooling and subsequent education and labor market outcomes in developed countries. Most studies find that delayed enrolment is positively associated with future outcomes including test scores (Weber and Puhani, 2006; Bedard and Dhuey, 2006; McEwan and Shapiro, 2008; Black et al., 2011; Fredriksson and Öckert, 2013), educational attainment (Mühlenweg and Puhani, 2010; Fredriksson and Öckert, 2013) and earnings (Fredriksson and Öckert, 2013).==== The main explanation for this advantage is that children who start school later exhibit greater “readiness” for learning and a stronger ability to acquire skills (Stipek, 2002).====Much less is known about the long-term impacts of age of enrolment in developing country settings. Pre-school is a sensitive period for brain development, and it is difficult to compensate later in life for disadvantages accumulated during this period (Heckman, 2006). Children are particularly open to acquiring certain skills, such as language, mathematics, etc., during the period between birth and age six (Montessori, 1995). In developed countries, pre-school childhood is usually filled by kindergarten and play time with siblings. Parents are conscious of the importance of conveying proper stimulus, for example by reading books or talking to the child. However, in developing countries, parents often are poorly educated, busy working, and lack awareness of the importance of stimulating their children. In rural China, preschool children frequently do not enroll in kindergarten (only 50.9% enrolment rate as late as 2009, Zhou, 2015). Only 30% of rural parents regularly read to their children.==== In such an environment, readiness to learn may decline with enrolment age because later entrants have missed the optimal period of learning.====A second factor which may lead to different effects of delayed primary school enrolment on educational attainment in developing country settings is greater sensitivity to the opportunity cost of schooling which increases steeply with age in teenage years when there is high demand for unskilled labor. China's rapid growth and urbanization after economic reforms created such demand, leading to dramatic increases in internal migration and rapidly rising wages for rural migrant workers. As a consequence, many rural youth enter the labor market right after completing middle school.==== Because age 16 is the legal minimum employment age in China, delaying school enrolment by one year can lead to much greater employment opportunities at the time of middle school graduation. Evidence from China's mini census data in 2005 shows that for those completing middle school, there is a notable increase in monthly income, migration rate, and employment rate each year from age 15 to age 18 (Fig. 1).====These factors unique to developing country settings may help explain why two previous studies set in China find a negative relationship between delayed enrolment and academic performance. Specifically, they find that a one-year delay in primary school enrolment reduces the probability of attending middle school by 6 percentage points (Chen, 2015) and decreases middle school cognitive test scores by 0.303 standard deviations (Zhang et al., 2017). The studies use samples with limited regional coverage==== and neither examines outcomes beyond middle school. One previous study finds a positive impact of delayed enrolment on years of schooling in China using a regression discontinuity design that could be sensitive to specification of the running variable (Guo et al., 2017). None of the China studies uses comparison groups unaffected by the Compulsory Education Law.====Anecdotal accounts suggest that parents in China prefer that their children start formal schooling as early as possible. Nearly every year representatives to the People's Congress suggest relaxing the rigid school entry age from six to five and a half, so that children born after September can enroll in the same year as peers born before the end of August.====In this paper, we study the impact of school entry age in China on years of schooling, focusing on the probability of high school enrolment, using China's 1986 Compulsory Education Law as a natural experiment. The Law made nine years of education (6 years of primary school plus 3 years of middle school) compulsory for all children in China. It established nationally for the first time that children were expected to enter school at age six, with a clear cutoff birthdate of August 31st. Before the Law was passed, the criteria for primary school age of enrolment was vague and differed across provinces. As seen in Fig. 2, although the average starting age for primary school was declining over time before the new Law, it dropped sharply for children born after 1980. However, high school attendance rates increased only gradually. If we break down school entry age by birth month and compare the average school entry age of older cohorts and younger cohorts (see Fig. 3), there is a clear increase in attendance age for younger cohorts born after August.====We build upon previous studies of this issue in China while addressing the key limitations of those studies and others that employ a regression discontinuity design based on birthday cutoffs for enrolment eligibility. In addition to potential endogeneity of birth month due to unobserved characteristics of parents who give birth at different times of the year (Buckles and Hungerman, 2013), Barua and Lang (2009) point out that if enforcement of the cutoff rule is imperfect and leads manipulative parents to exert effort to enroll their children earlier, while causing the children of compliant parents to delay enrolment, then a monotonicity assumption needed for the consistency of LATE is violated. Our approach addresses both concerns by exploiting a change in the enrolment cutoff birthdate mandated by China's Compulsory Education Law, which enables us to focus on the impact of the new cutoff date on cohorts affected by the Law compared to older cohorts not affected by the Law.====Using this more convincing identification strategy, we estimate the impact of age of enrolment on high school attendance using two datasets with national coverage–China's 2005 mini-census data and the 2010 wave of the Chinese Family Panel Study (henceforth CFPS). We find that the Law causes a 0.24 years increase in the age of primary school enrolment for those born after August compared to those born before the end of August, and that an increase in the age of school enrolment by one year reduces the probability of enrolling in high school by 3.6 percentage points. This confirms that the impact of delayed primary schooling in China is opposite to that found in the US and other developed countries.====In addition to this contribution, we conduct additional analyses that explore the importance of the two mechanisms posited above to explain the negative effect of primary school enrolment age on educational attainment in developing country settings, specifically that children who enroll later do not learn as well, and are more influenced by labor market demand when deciding whether to attend high school. Regarding readiness to learn, we analyze the determinants of test scores by grade level using data from a rural sample and find that later-enrolled students are more likely to perform worse at the beginning of primary school. However, the negative impact on test scores does not persist to higher grade levels in middle school. Next, we find that delayed enrolment has a more negative effect in areas with higher opportunity cost, proxied by the size of migration networks. The above evidence suggests that the negative delayed enrolment effect is primarily driven by the higher opportunity cost for older students upon middle school graduation.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows. The second section presents a model of the decision to enroll in high school that formally shows the different ways that age of enrolment may affect the enrolment decision.

We hypothesize that an upper or Other Backward caste (OBC) household's propensity to practise untouchability is determined not solely by its own characteristics but, crucially, also by the inter-group distribution of resources across both caste and religious divides, via political contestation over behavioural norms. Our model predicts that greater collective resource endowment (power) of SCs, or that of Muslims and Christians, will reduce the likelihood of an upper caste or OBC household practising untouchability. A marginal redistribution of power from OBCs to upper castes may reduce it as well. Greater power of the combined upper caste and OBC bloc will increase it. Identifying a community's power with its population weighted land share, we find associations consistent with these predictions in data from the India Human Development Survey 2011–12.","An extensive literature, stemming from the seminal work of Becker (1957), has sought to address the twin questions of how (a) individual cost-benefit calculus may sustain or undercut economic and social discrimination, and (b) how such discrimination may in turn affect the wellbeing of individuals. In reality, the cost-benefit structure, within whose parameters individuals take decentralized decisions about whether to indulge their ‘taste’ for discrimination, is itself often determined by a prior process of conscious collective political action undertaken by antagonistic groups. Competing political mobilizations and contestations around the US Civil Rights movement, which critically influenced both the content and enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation, constitute one example. Yet, economic analyses of discrimination usually abstract from these prior political processes of collective action and group conflict. This paper seeks to address this lacuna in the literature by foregrounding such processes as critical determinants of decentralized individual decision-making, within the context of a particularly extreme form of socio-economic discrimination. Specifically, we examine the role played by village-level community power in influencing the practice of untouchability amongst upper and backward caste Hindus in rural India. We theoretically model the idea that a Hindu upper or backward caste household's propensity to practise untouchability vis-à-vis Hindu ‘scheduled’ castes is determined not solely by its own characteristics but, crucially, also by the inter-group distribution of resources across both caste and religious divides. We rationalize this as the consequence of village-level conflicts over collective assertions of both caste and religious identities. Our empirical analysis draws attention to the community power of ‘third parties’ such as Muslims and Christians, as well as social cleavages between upper and backward caste Hindus, as possible explanations for much of the incidence of untouchability.====India's caste system, a defining feature of Hinduism, is perhaps the world's longest surviving social hierarchy. Traditionally, Hindu society has been segmented into a complex ranking of various castes, based on notions of ritual purity. Brahmins were placed at the apex, followed by other ‘Forward’ castes and the so-called ‘Other Backward’ castes (OBCs), while the so-called ‘Scheduled’ castes (SCs) constituted the bottom of the hierarchy. Occupational specialization and endogamy have been the key characteristics of the system, with Brahmins constituting the traditional intelligentsia, Forward castes (FCs) largely engaged in administration, law enforcement and trade, OBCs constituting the primary component of the peasantry, and SCs confined to menial and low-end artisanal occupations. Norms of ritual purity and pollution, which underlie the system, include the idea that individuals belonging to other castes would be ‘polluted’ by coming into physical contact with those born into the SC category. This leads to the practice of ‘untouchability’: the avoidance of physical contact by the former with the latter. Historically, this entailed residential segregation, stringent restrictions on social interaction between SCs and other castes including a complete taboo on inter-marriage, avoidance by other castes of food handled by SCs, non-access of SCs to public spaces and communal facilities such as roads, village wells, schools, temples, and entry barriers against SCs in most professions.====Discrimination against SCs in general and the practice of untouchability in particular were made illegal by the Indian Constitution immediately after Independence, and affirmative action programs were instituted for their benefit.==== However, despite legal prohibition, the practice continues to limit access of SCs to public spaces and facilities, as well as informal social and professional networks, especially in less developed rural areas. This restricts the accumulation of social capital on their part and puts up significant structural barriers to their entry into historically upper caste occupations.==== An understanding of the factors that determine the prevalence of untouchability thus remains of critical importance in reducing caste-based rigidities and entry barriers in India's labour market.====Extensive, and often violent, conflicts between SCs and upper castes or OBCs, as well as between Hindus and Muslims, continue to constitute arguably the most salient features of the political landscape in India.==== Such group conflicts provide the motivating backdrop for our analysis. Our entry-point is the idea that the legitimacy of caste-exclusionary Hindu behavioural norms is ==== at the village level. It is determined as the outcome of a prior process of group conflict and negotiation between upper castes and OBCs on the one hand, and SCs on the other. The outcomes of such caste contests are however affected by a simultaneous process of religious conflict between Hindus and Muslims (or Christians). Hence, the incidence of untouchability is impacted by village-level differences in the distribution of resources (and therefore political power) across caste and religious communities. An upper caste or OBC Hindu household's decision to practise untouchability is determined not solely by its own inherent characteristics (as in Thorat and Joshi, 2020), but, crucially, also by the inter-group distribution of collective resources, via the mediation of a process of political contestation. As such, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to examine how collective caste power may determine the decentralized and individual incidence of the practice of untouchability by upper caste and OBC Hindus, and we do so both theoretically and empirically.====We develop a model of tripartite group contestation over social norms, wherein the combined upper caste and OBC Hindu bloc engages in a contest with the SC community over the extent to which behavioural norms within the village should legitimise the practice of untouchability, even as it seeks to impose Hindu values and rituals on religious minorities. There are four communities in our model: SCs, upper castes (Brahmins and Forward castes), OBCs and non-Hindus (Muslims and Christians). Each community is assumed to achieve perfect internal coordination, reflecting the presence of effective within-community governance structures, so that it can be modelled as an individual allocating its resource endowment between material consumption and conflict over behavioural norms, in order to best satisfy its preferences. Village social norms, determined as the equilibrium outcome of the simultaneous inter-play of caste and religious contests, determine the cost to an individual from practising untouchability. Hindu upper caste and OBC individuals take this cost as given and decide to practise untouchability if their individual (idiosyncratic) benefit from such behaviour exceeds the cost.====Our model predicts that any increase in the collective resource endowment (‘power’) of non-SC Hindus within the village, by shifting the outcome of the caste conflict against SCs, will increase the proportion of upper caste or OBC households therein which practise untouchability. The opposite holds for an increase in the power of SCs. Interestingly, any increase in the power of Muslims or Christians will reduce this proportion. This happens due to greater diversion of resources from the caste conflict to the religious conflict by non-SC Hindus in response to such an increase. Even more striking is the prediction that increases in the power of upper castes, relative to that of the OBCs, may reduce the prevalence of untouchability amongst upper castes and OBCs as well. This happens due to free-riding by upper castes on OBCs in both caste and religious conflicts, when the former are significantly resource-poor relative to the latter. In those situations, a marginal redistribution of resources from OBCs to upper castes reduces the allocation by OBCs to the caste conflict, without inducing upper castes to enter that conflict. Thus, upper castes continue to contribute nothing to it. Hence, the outcome of the caste conflict shifts in favour of SCs – more non-SC Hindus choose not to practise untouchability in consequence. A community's resource endowment serves as an empirical proxy for its political power in our model, in that, ceteris paribus, a community fares better in every conflict it engages in whenever its resource endowment increases.====Using rural household-level data from the India Human Development Survey II – 2011–12 (IHDS 2012), we seek empirical confirmation of the comparative static associations predicted by our theoretical model, with regard to the outcome of the caste conflict, i.e., the incidence of untouchability amongst upper caste and OBC Hindus. Data constraints prevent us from empirically examining either the predictions regarding the outcome of the religious conflict, or those regarding conflict intensities and participation patterns, generated by our theoretical analysis. For purposes of empirical scrutiny, we identify a community's resource endowment (or power) with its share of land weighted by its population share at the village level.==== We find a negative and statistically significant association between the community power, so defined, of both SCs and non-Hindus (Muslims and Christians), and the likelihood of an upper caste or OBC household practising untouchability. The association between the community power of upper castes and OBCs combined and the likelihood of such a household practising untouchability is positive and significant. The estimated relationship between such likelihood and the power of upper castes relative to that of the OBCs is negative at low levels of relative upper caste power, but positive at high levels. Thus, our empirical findings regarding the association between community power and likelihood of an upper caste or OBC household practising untouchability are consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model (though they do not logically suffice to validate the causality claims/mechanisms advanced in the latter).==== In sum, therefore, we are able to integrate the literature on caste conflict with that on Hindu-Muslim conflict at a theoretical level, apply that integrated theoretical framework to the analysis of untouchability, and generate novel findings with regard to the prevalence of that practice both theoretically and empirically. In so doing, we are also able to address the more general question of how collective political action may affect individual incentives to practise social discrimination. Our analysis thus carries broader methodological implications for investigation of social conflict and discrimination beyond India.====Anderson (2011) and Iverson et al., 2014 consider the effect of caste divisions and caste power on household income of lower castes in villages dominated by upper castes. In foregrounding the importance of village-level caste power in individual behavioural choices, our analysis bears a family resemblance to theirs. We depart from them in addressing untouchability – a dimension unexplored by them. Chauchard (2014) examines whether political quotas for SCs reduce discriminatory intentions of other castes against them, while Girard (2018) studies how the exclusion of SCs from the use of public roads in rural India is affected by such quotas. Our analysis shares the same broad objective – to identify factors that might reduce discrimination against SCs – but differs in its focus on structural caste power, instead of affirmative action. Bros and Couttenier (2015) draw attention to the role of violence in the enforcement of norms of untouchability, but do not investigate how caste power might influence the extent and consequences of such violence. Sharma (2015) examines violence and property crimes against SCs as well, but without connecting them explicitly or tightly to untouchability.==== We interpret inter-caste conflict and contestation, including but not limited to outright violence, as the process through which structural caste power affects individual choices regarding the practice of untouchability.====Section 2 offers some preliminary observations from IHDS 2012 regarding the prevalence of the practice of untouchability in rural (relative to urban/metro) areas of India across different states and caste groups. These findings serve as stylised facts for our analytical model-building exercise in Section 3. In Section 4, we report and discuss the regression results that show the results from IHDS 2012 to be consistent with the relevant predictions yielded by our theoretical model. We conclude in Section 5. Detailed proofs of propositions are presented in an appendix.","Touch thee not: Group conflict, caste power and untouchability in rural India",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300858,29 December 2020,2020,Research Article,124.0

We find that an increase in markups is positively associated with rising income inequality. More interestingly, not only do extra profits from higher markups accrue to the top-income group, but also, within the top-income group (top 10%), the higher top-income earners (top 1%) tend to benefit disproportionately more than the lower top-income earners (top 5% or 10%). Finally, we highlight the role of ","Many studies in economics attempt to understand the causes of rising income inequality.==== Until recently, however, only a few theoretical and empirical studies, which we review below, have analyzed the role played by competition. In the absence of competition, market power and corporate rent-seeking lead to an increase in prices relative to marginal costs (markups). Since extra profits are distributed in proportion to current firm ownership claims, these higher prices hurt consumers who pay higher prices than would have prevailed had the industry been competitive, but benefit business owners, corporate managers, and executives. Indeed, these individuals with firm ownership claims are concentrated at the top of the income distribution. Therefore, market power and corporate rent-seeking lead to a redistribution of income from consumers to firm owners. In the long-run, the accumulated redistribution from consumers to firm owners helps top-income groups accumulate more firm ownership claims, thereby raising their income even more disproportionately.==== As a result, the lack of competition is associated with rising income inequality. This study empirically explores the association between the two.====Using data for 20 countries during 1975–2011, we regress an index of income inequality on our estimated measure of the lack of competition for an array of country-year pairs. Our baseline indices for income inequality are the inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient and top income shares from Piketty (2014). We construct our measure of the lack of competition by estimating the markups for each country-year pair, following the approaches of Hall (1986, 1988, 1990), Roeger (1995), and De Loecker and Warzynski (2012). In order to check the robustness of our results, we also use the net Gini Index by Solt (2009), as an alternative index of income inequality, and construct alternative markups using different data and methods.====Our first main result is that an increase in markups is positively associated with rising income inequality. In our baseline estimation, for every 1 percentage point increase in markups, the inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient increases by 0.37 percentage points. More interestingly, we also find that not only is the increase in markups positively associated with the income shares of the top-income group, but also that the association is higher for higher top-income groups. In particular, for every 1 percentage point increase in markups, the top 10%, 5%, 1%, and 0.1% income shares increase by 0.09, 0.13, 0.26, and 1.15 percentage points, respectively. This result implies that the extra profits from higher markups not only accrue to the top-income groups, but also that within the top-income groups (top 10%), the higher top-income earners (top 1%, for instance) tend to benefit disproportionately more than the lower top-income earners (top 5% or 10%). Our main findings are robust with alternative estimation methods, data, and other control variables that could influence income inequality, such as financial openness, trade liberalization, technological progress, financial market development, government expenditure, and a democracy index.====The direct policy implication of our findings is that pro-competition policies that reduce markups can also alleviate income inequality. Therefore, policymakers might need to shift from a narrow focus on pro-labor market policies toward a more comprehensive approach that considers the distributional effects of market concentration. Based on similar findings, the studies reviewed below also emphasize the role of aggressive antitrust laws and enforcement that aims to curtail the corporate abuse of power. In our additional analysis, we instead get closer to the final distribution channel and explore the effect of labor market institutions on the association between markups and income inequality. To do that, using the data on labor market institutions from Botero et al. (2004), we include the interaction terms between markups and the indices of labor protection in our original regression. We find that better labor protection—such as the statutory protection and power of labor unions, generous unemployment benefits, and mandatory minimum wages—alleviates the effect of markups on income inequality, thereby indirectly reducing inequality.====Our study is related to a small but growing literature linking reduced competition to increasing inequality. Comanor and Smiley (1975) is an early attempt to explore the distributional effects of monopolies. Formulating and estimating a model of monopoly and wealth inequality, they argue that the lack of competition leaves 93% of the population worse off. Creedy and Dixon (1998, 1999) also argue that low-income households experience a higher welfare loss than high-income households due to the lack of competition.====More recently, observing the considerable increase in wealth and income inequality—a trend accompanied by a rise in measured markups—a number of economists and practitioners has paid more attention to the association between reduced competition and inequality. Among others, the most related works are Ennis and Kim (2016), Ennis, Gonzaga, and Pike (2019), Gans, Leigh, Schmalz, and Triggs (2019), and Boar and Midrigan (2019). Building on Comanor and Smiley (1975), Ennis and Kim (2016) argue that a lack of competition increases the share of wealth of the top 10% of households by 10–24% in eight OECD countries. In addition to a similar effect on the share of wealth, Ennis, Gonzaga, and Pike (2019) argue that a lack of competition reduces the income of the poorest 20% by 14–19 percentage. Gans, Leigh, Schmalz, and Triggs (2019) find that the ownership of corporate equity becomes increasingly skewed towards the top-income earners than consumption in the US. Boar and Midrigan (2019) formulate an incomplete market model with entrepreneurial decisions and a collateral constraint to analyze the effect of alternative counterfactual policies aimed at alleviating the distributional costs of markups.====Lastly, there are also important policy papers and briefs. The recent papers by Stiglitz (2012), Furman and Orszag (2015), Furman (2018), and UNCTAD (2018) emphasize the role of market concentration on rising inequality among the other sources of rising inequality. In order to address rising inequality, Baker and Salop (2015) highlight the possible role of pro-competition policies. In a similar vein, Khan and Vaheesan (2017) argue that failure of antitrust to preserve competitive markets contributes to regressive wealth and income distribution.====We view our empirical findings as complementary to these studies’ findings because we also emphasize the distributional role of reduced competition. However, our study differs markedly in terms of coverage, methods, and policy implications. While other studies often explore both wealth and income inequality for a smaller set of countries, we focus on income distribution using data for a larger number of countries. In terms of methods, while we rely on a reduced form estimation, we consider alternative combinations of different estimation methods and data sets to conduct robustness checks. Finally, while other studies only focus on product market policies such as antitrust and regulation, we employ data on labor market institutions to highlight the importance of labor market policies as well. In particular, our findings reveal that pro-labor market policies can indirectly alleviate the distributional effect of markups. In this regard, our study provides richer policy implications than previous studies that emphasize only the direct, distributive effect of pro-labor market policies.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.

When those transfers ended, some recipients of these transfers eventually democratized as part of the ”Third Wave” while others languished as violent autocracies. This raises a puzzle: how can declines in external transfers foster ==== in some cases, but heighten political violence in others? We develop a formal model to reconcile this tension and demonstrate that autocratic incumbents can become more repressive with higher levels of transfers and either experience civil conflict or democratize at lower levels of transfers. We characterize these dynamics as a ”political transfer problem” and then use case studies and ==== evidence to argue that the largest ==== of the 20th century, the period from 1973–85 during which oil prices were at all-time highs, and its aftermath, produced political dynamics consistent with our model.","According to the International Energy Agency, the COVID-19 emergency and the ensuing fall-off in demand for oil may have already brought about “peak oil“ (IEA, 2020). Rising interest in a low-carbon sources of energy led ==== to observe that while oil “fueled the 20th century” wars and politics, a new global order would soon emerge as a result of the energy transition (2020). It will be some years before the long-term impact of this dramatic change in the distribution of rents from commodity production is understood, should it occur. But we can examine the consequences of the last global commodity supercycle which definitively ended in the mid 1980s. While the direct impact of the oil revenue windfalls on producer nations is well studied, as exemplified by the resource curse (e.g., Ross, 2001, Smith, 2008) and rentier state (e.g., Beblawi, 1987) literatures, what is less explored is the impact of the reallocation of those rents around the world.====In this paper, we seek to document how the emergence of largely exogenous unearned foreign transfers in the 1970s may have significantly transformed the trajectories of war and governance in many developing countries. The 1973 oil embargo set in motion a dozen years of sky-high oil prices, filling the coffers of the producer states. Those producers, including Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union, did not absorb all of the windfall domestically, but redistributed some of it abroad in the form of foreign aid, petrodollar savings, and trade subsidies. As we show in this paper, when those transfers ended, recipients of these transfers in Latin America and Eastern Europe eventually democratized as part of the “Third Wave” while many Muslim-majority societies languished as violent autocracies.====To illustrate some of these dynamics, Fig. 1a, Fig. 1b plot the annual average POLITY score and incidence of civil war from 1960 to 2010 across these groups of countries.==== ==== So that we do not inadvertently capture effects from domestic oil rents, all the countries in the figures are developing economies that are not themselves oil producers. Fig. 1a reveals a divergence in democratization, with successful outcomes beginning in the early 1980s for Latin American countries, following in the late 1980s for Eastern Europe, and with Muslim non-oil producers on average failing to reach the threshold for democracy. The trajectory towards democracy in the “control” group of other non-oil producing developing countries, as Fig. 1a demonstrates, falls somewhere in between.==== ====
 Fig. 1b reveals a surge in conflict among Muslim non-oil producers from the late 1980s through the end of the century, relative to other countries.==== The patterns in Fig. 1a, Fig. 1b underlie the core empirical puzzle this paper probes: why did many Latin American and Eastern European countries peacefully transition to democracy after the mid-1980s, while many Muslim-majority societies remained conflict prone and authoritarian? In an effort to answer this question, we provide a formal model and corroborative case and statistical evidence that links variation in exogenously-driven foreign transfers (unearned income) to patterns of comparative democratization and conflict. Our decision to formally model the patterns in Fig. 1a, Fig. 1b stems from existing theoretical accounts which treat the relationship between unearned income and democracy/civil conflict as ==== outcomes. This is surprising as democracy and civil conflict are related (see Blattman and Miguel, 2010 for an overview). Thus to gain theoretical precision, we articulate a formal model describing how variation in unearned income affects the prospects for democracy and civil conflict in a unified framework.====Our model generates two predictions, which we characterize as a “political transfer problem”. The political transfer problem is a reference to the original “transfer problem” (Keynes, 1929), which described the relative price distortions inherent in Germany’s reparation payments after the Great War. In the political transfer problem, the flow of unearned income may lead to the equilibrium over political violence to become unbalanced, just as in the economic transfer problem, extracting taxes for reparations may lead to the production and consumption of goods and services being unbalanced. An unearned windfall in one country, not fully absorbed, may result in unearned income showing up elsewhere in the global system, and bringing with it the dynamics of political rents. First, we illustrate an effect of received rents: when a non-democratic country experiences a reduction in unearned income, it may trigger a transition into democracy, but a democratic country experiencing a similar reduction will remain in democracy. Second, we address the heterogeneity in response when unearned income falls in a non-democratic country: a country with cohesive, redistributive institutions is more likely to transition to democracy, while a country whose institutions are less egalitarian is more likely to remain in repression or civil conflict.====Our model builds on the work of Besley and Persson, 2009, Besley and Persson, 2010, Besley and Persson, 2011a, Besley and Persson, 2011b and extends it to allow for the possibility that the incumbent can deter attacks by the opposition when government resources are sufficiently high. The model is essentially a one-shot sequential game, and when unearned resources are moderate, an incumbent will respond to an insurgency with only moderate violence, which encourages an attack by the insurgents. When unearned resources dwarf the costs of fielding a large army the incumbent would be willing to spend enough to squash an insurgency, and the insurgents are deterred from attacking. This set-up allows us to capture the empirical experience of countries that we see in the data, where we observe a deescalation in violence even as there are increases in the unearned rents in a country.====Guided by the model and cognizant that unearned income is endogenous with a country’s domestic political economy, our empirics focus on three forms of exogenously driven foreign transfers: foreign aid to non-oil producing Muslim countries, petro-dollar loans to Latin American governments, and trade subsidies to former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe. These transfers share three important features: (1) a significant fraction of these transfers accrued to the government’s budget,==== ==== (2) they therefore represent a form of “unearned” (nontax) income, and (3) were highly correlated with oil prices.==== ==== As we show with our reduced form estimates, for the latter, the exogeneity of oil prices allows us to draw plausibly causal inferences. The magnitudes of these capital flows were quite substantial: Gulf aid comprised some 13.5 percent of total (global) aid between 1974 and 1994, and much of it went to Muslim recipient countries (Neumayer, 2003, 134). In Latin America, petro-dollar borrowing amounted to over $7.5 billion per annum in the late 1970s, which was equivalent to 20 percent of combined exports over the same period (Devlin, 1989), 17 and 20). In a less appreciated case, the Soviet Union transferred somewhere between $30 and $100 billion in trade subsidies (measured in 1984 dollars) to Eastern Europe, under-pricing oil exports relative to imported manufactured goods (Liberman 1998, 132). Our rough calculations for the total transfers to the non-oil Muslim countries and Latin American borrowers are that they are of a similar order of magnitude. In contrast, total global GDP for low and middle income countries in 1980, according to World Bank data, was around $2 trillion; thus each type of transfer, though spread out over a decade, was on the order of 2.5% of developing-country GDP.====Our central question is broad and faces the same problem of many of the “big questions” of political economy — that there are as many competing explanations as data points. Our approach to this problem is to bring a multi-method approach, since we do not expect that any single methodological approach will be sufficiently convincing given the inherent challenges of endogeneity. First, we advance a formal model to bring theoretical clarity to the question.==== ==== We generate two core empirical implications: (i) a reduction in transfers can shift a country from conflict or repression into democracy, but not away from democracy and (ii) a democratic transition is more likely when transfers decline if the country’s underlying institutions are more cohesive. Second, we present historical case studies of the three massive transfers of unearned income from and to autocrats during the 20th century, combining qualitative and statistical evidence. Our goal with these case studies is to sufficiently describe each episode so as to demonstrate the magnitude and characteristics of the transfer as they relate to the theoretical variables and the historical importance; we present the case studies as complementary rather than as a stand-alone contribution.====Third, we provide statistical corroboration for our case studies with reduced form estimates linking plausibly exogenous variation in oil prices to differential patterns of civil war and democracy in Muslim, Latin American, and Eastern European countries. Our analysis shows that lower levels of transfers (associated with declining oil prices) are associated with improvements in democracy in Latin America and former Soviet Satellites, but have no discernible effect on democracy in Muslim societies. Rather, Muslim societies are significantly more likely to experience civil war at lower levels of transfers (associated with declining oil prices). As we argue in Sections 3 Case studies, 4 Statistical corroboration, we link these differential effects associated with lower levels of transfers (via oil prices) to regional differences in cohesive institutions. Relative to non-Muslim societies, Muslim societies tend to exhibit less cohesive institutions. Our statistical analysis also allows us to evaluate several competing explanations, such as the Catholic Church’s role (e.g., through the Second Vatican Council) in advancing democracy (Andersen and Jensen 2019) and the role of geopolitics in shaping patterns of civil war and democracy after the end of Cold War (Fukuyama, 1992, Kalyvas and Balcells, 2010, Berger et al., 2013). Our aim is that through this multi-method approach, the weight of theoretical plausibility and empirical probability will support our interpretation of the important role of internationally-transferred unearned income in shaping patterns of comparative democratization and conflict.====Our articulation of a political transfer problem speaks to prominent literatures in political economy. First, it is situated in the emerging research on fragile states. For example, Besley and Persson (2011b) have attempted to sharpen the discussion from numerous policy papers (e.g., Zoellick, 2009) to articulate how fragile states end up the way they do. Second, the paper is related to the literature on unearned income and the resource curse (e.g., Ross, 2001, Smith, 2008, Haber and Menaldo, 2011), especially those that document a “conditional” resource curse predicated on a variety of domestic conditions, such as income inequality (Dunning, 2008), pre-existing institutions (Menaldo, 2016), ownership structure (Luong and Weinthal, 2010), electoral institutions (Mahdavi, 2015), and economic integration (Kurtz and Brooks, 2011). Third, by investigating the link between aid windfalls and domestic politics, we speak to research on foreign aid and political stability (e.g., Collier and Hoeffler, 2004, Ross, 2004, Morrison, 2009, Nielsen et al., 2011). Finally, by examining the impact of foreign transfers on democracy, we contribute to wider scholarship on the international sources of democratization (e.g., Pevehouse, 2005), as well as studies focusing on how democratization can affect political violence (Snyder, 2000).",The political transfer problem: How cross-border financial windfalls affect democracy and civil war,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300718,20 November 2020,2020,Research Article,126.0

In 2013, China passed a new regulation that banned politicians from serving on the boards of directors of companies. Using a novel data set that links board members, government officials, and forced resignations, I estimate the effect of the policy on firm performance and ====. I find that the loss of a high-level politician significantly reduces a firm’s cumulative stock return and future profits. The effect is driven by officials from government-controlled public sectors and is larger when the firm is in low-marketized areas. The analysis provides important evidence about the efficacy of a commonly used policy tool for reducing political influence in the private sector.","Countries differ significantly in the extent to which they regulate firms’ political connections. While some countries have no or only minor restrictions on high-level government officials owning shares of or working for private companies (e.g., Belgium, India, Japan, and Mexico), others prohibit such relationships (e.g., Brazil, Ireland, and the Philippines), and several have moderate policies (e.g., France, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S.).==== The wide variation in policies across countries suggests little consensus about whether relationships between politicians and firms should be regulated. While a vast literature examines how political connections affect firm outcomes, there is far less evidence about whether government policies effectively eliminate such connections and generate similar effects. This paper considers these questions by examining one of the most common policies for regulating political connections: not allowing active politicians to serve on corporate boards. I estimate the short- and long-run stock return and profit effects of a new policy that bans politicians from serving on corporate boards in China.====The effect of political connectedness on firm value is theoretically ambiguous (Krueger, 1974). A number of studies find advantages for politically connected firms, as connections may distort resource allocation through preferential lending (Mian, Khwaja, 2005, Wu, Wu, Liu, 2008, Chan, Dang, Yan, 2012, Cull, Li, Sun, Xu, 2015), government bailout (Faccio et al., 2006), legal protection (Li et al., 2008), government contract (Goldman et al., 2013), and export concentration (Bai, Hsieh, Song, 2014, Ding, Fan, Lin, 2017). There is also evidence that these effects may be larger in areas with weaker market institutions Lin et al. (2016). However, political connections can also harm a company. For example, politically connected board members may be less effective in firm monitoring (Shi et al., 2018), reduce investment efficiency in State-owned enterprises (Chen et al., 2011), or cause firms to lose independence from the government and hinder firm decision-making (Marquis and Qian, 2013). The effects of political connections on social efficiency are also ambiguous. Ferreira (2010) notes that board members with political experience may provide valuable guidance and help firms navigate government requirements. Conversely, Shleifer and Vishny (1994) show that rent-seeking typically occurs when politicians can bring profits to the firm, and a social welfare loss may occur if they distort resource allocation.====There are several challenges in identifying the policy effect intended to regulate political connections. First, measuring political connectedness can be difficult, as personal relationships are hard to observed in data. Second, it is hard to make valid comparisons across countries due to endogeneity concerns, as countries make their policy decisions in response to local conditions. Likewise, comparing firms with and without political connections within a country may be problematic, as political connections may correlate with unobservable factors that cause differences in firm performance. A political connection may result from a firm’s performance, rather than vise versa. To generate an unbiased estimate of the impact of a specific policy, we need an exogenous shock that is both observable and not otherwise correlated with firm performance.====This paper examines the effect of a sharp policy change in China. Announced in the autumn of 2013, Regulation No.18 prohibited government officials from serving on corporate boards and receiving any income from firms. Firms had one year to comply with the policy, after which all government officials must leave. Focusing on listed firms, I determine whether a company has an independent director who is a politician, the number of directors who are politicians, their administrative levels, and the actual occupancy of government officials. I examine short-run and long-run outcomes of the new policy using a difference-in-differences design. To allow for heterogeneous effects, I differentiate by the number and importance of the politicians who were affected, and whether they are from narrowly defined government offices or predominant public sectors.====To conduct the analysis, I create a new data set that links Chinese stock returns with an original data set of board member resignations. In China, listed firms are required to disclose board member resignations by posting resignation reports, and I link each resigning board member with a database of government officials. I find that firms with politicians follow a very similar stock return trajectory to firms without politicians prior to the announcement of the policy. However, after policy implementation, these cumulative returns diverge significantly. In the very short run, the announcement of the regulation does not sharply change the stock returns of firms with politicians on their boards. In the longer run, however, stock returns of firms with high-level political connections fall by 5.3% relative to firms of similar size and industry. The discrepancy between short-run and long-run results may be explained by limitations in the market’s ability to predict long-run effects, or by the fact that long-run changes in stock return are too modest and uncertain relative to typical short-run fluctuations to generate an investor response.====An analysis of treatment heterogeneity shows that the effects are increasing in the number of politicians who resign: cumulative returns decline by 5%, 7%, and 21% if firms lose 1, 2, or 3 or more high-level politicians, respectively. Notably, the effect on abnormal return is mainly driven by high-level officials that work in State-owned enterprises or government-controlled public sectors (8%) instead of narrowly defined government offices. In contrast, the resignations of low-level officials have no significant effect. The differential effects of high- and low-level politicians suggest that only high-level politicians have enough information and influence to generate stock return effects. The difference between officials working in government offices and public sectors may stem from the fact that those work in public sectors may receive less supervision before the regulation and thus is more likely to seek rent. The effects are strongly associated with market institutions. In provinces with weaker marketization, the loss of political connections further reduces firms’ stock returns. However, the value of political connections cannot be fully explained by synergies. Politicians working in the same region or same fields of connected firms do not provide higher values than those not. The results are robust to several alternative specifications. These include firm fixed effects, changing sample periods, and various methods of choosing untreated firms to control for time trends in stock returns.====The estimated policy effect in this paper is in the middle range of those in the broader political-connectedness literature, indicating that a) the policy effectively reduced political influence, and that b) firms benefit from political connections. For example, Fisman (2001) finds that being connected to President Suharto contributed as much as 23% to firm value in Indonesia, while Fisman et al. (2012) find little effect of having Vice President Cheney as a board member in the U.S. Other estimates of the effect of political connections in the literature include 6% in Italy (Cingano and Pinotti, 2013), 13% in Egypt (Acemoglu et al., 2014), 5% in the U.S. (Goldman et al., 2009), and 2% to 4% across 47 countries (Faccio, 2006). In China, Xu and Zhou (2008) exploit a political scandal and find that related firms experience a 2% reduction in returns. Similar to the lagged response in this paper, Fisman and Wang (2015) finds no immediate effects. However, prices of politically connected firms fall by 7% in the 30 trading days following a fatal accident that affects a politician’s career. Xu (2018) considers a narrower definition of politicians in China and finds longer-run negative effects of losing political connections of approximately 4% measured in Tobin’s Q, which is consistent with the baseline result for high-level politicians in this study. In contrast, Tang et al. (2016) find that the announcement of Regulation No.18 resulted in a 3% reduction in short-run returns. Shi et al. (2018) study abnormal returns using the same shock and find an opposite signed effect, with politically connected directors destroying rather than creating value in the short run.====In addition to these mixed results, I find that abnormal returns effects vary by the nature of connected politicians. Politicians in high administrative level, and working in a less-supervised occupancy, may bring the most value to the firm. Specifically, in China, the result suggests higher supervision for generalized government branches, including State-owned Enterprises and government-controlled public sectors.====This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, because the analysis is based on a sudden change in the law in the world’s second-largest economy, the resulting estimates reveal the effects of a specific, commonly used policy that governments use to combat the influences of political corruption. The analysis provides compelling evidence that such policies reduce the political connectedness of firms. Second, the large number of affected firms (more than 600) allows for precise estimates of the influence of higher and lower-level politicians from different occupancy and an examination of whether the benefits of connectedness are increasing in the number of associated politicians. Specifically, I find that empowered leaders in public sectors may bring values to firms. Finally, the analysis considers the short- and long-run effects of political connections on stock returns, and whether there are observable changes in firms’ profitability.====The paper is organized as follows.

Using a unique dataset constructed from open-ended responses in the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, we conduct a structural analysis of wage distribution dynamics for higher education graduates over 2002–2016. In addition to the standard mean wage estimations across majors we explore within-major and across-cohort variation, as well as major-specific permanent and transitory variance components and their time paths.====The results suggest that changing wage inequality among university graduates is due to both changes in skill prices and wage shocks induced by economic fluctuations. Moreover, variation in skill prices relates to equilibrium effects induced by changes in the supply of graduates specialized in different fields. Uneven expansion in certain majors induces labor ==== and leads to an increase in the wage variance of graduates from the fastest growing majors. The estimation results also show the importance of accounting for within-major heterogeneity across cohorts, which could reflect differences in student ability distribution, changes in academic content, and changes in educational quality over time. Finally, this study suggests that focusing only on mean wage returns, without assessing the distributional implications, might substantially understate the labor market impact of the changing major composition.","While the classical literature considers years of education as a leading determinant of earnings heterogeneity, the recent literature argues that, given an increasingly educated workforce, workers’ skills and specialization become more important than quantity of education for determining wages. For instance, Altonji et al. (2016) and Altonji et al. (2012) argue that large variation in wages among US college graduates is driven by occupation-specific human capital, which conditions workers’ professional paths and careers. Altonji et al. (2014) suggest that the increasing wage inequality over the last 20 years is due to the widening inequality in returns to major-specific skills.====However, wage dynamics are not explored in the literature from the perspective of evolving skill composition of the labor force with higher education. Some descriptive estimates focus on wage differentials between groups of workers specialized in different fields (Altonji, Arcidiacono, Maurel, 2016, Altonji, Blom, Meghir, 2012) or payoffs by major (Kirkeboen et al., 2016). Yet, the educated labor force does not grow homogeneously but expands under the dynamic supply of graduates specialized in different fields and supplying skills and abilities varying across cohorts. The changing skill distribution induced by the evolving major composition and expanding higher education is likely to contribute to shaping wage dynamics and re-equilibrating the labor market.====This paper studies the effects of changes in the composition of academic majors on the wage dynamics using the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS)==== and structural analysis of wage distribution. We decompose the wage dynamics of college graduates in Russia over 2002–2016 in light of a significant expansion of higher education, which was accompanied by changes in the distribution of different fields of specialization. Boosted by the transition to a market economy, the expansion of higher education in Russia was exceptionally fast over 1995–2009. During this time there was an important shift towards majoring in the social sciences and a decline in majoring in the sciences and technical fields. While similar trends are observed in many advanced economies over past decades, the Russian context is advantageous in terms of empirical analysis of higher education and labor market dynamics because of the magnitude and speed of the changes.====The contribution of the paper is multifaceted. First, we show that growing inequality and growing variation in the price of skills in the labor market is particularly high among graduates in the fastest growing socio-economic majors. We show that changing inequality among university graduates is due to both changes in the price of skills in the labor market and wage shocks caused by economic fluctuations. The results suggest that skill price variation might relate to equilibrium effects induced by changing supply of graduates specialized in different fields.====We also contribute to the literature by providing evidence for the importance of within-major skill heterogeneity across cohorts. The heterogeneity is induced by changes in academic content and educational quality and relates to differences in student ability distribution, changes in academic content, and changes in educational quality over time.====From the methodological perspective, our study shows that wage analysis exclusively focused on mean wage returns would understate the labor market impact of the changing major composition. We contribute to the literature by exploring not only between-major wage differentials but also within-major variation. We study both of these dimensions over time and across several cohorts. Specifically, in addition to exploring the time trends of major distribution and major-specific wages, we analyze the variance of wages decomposed into permanent and transitory variations, along with their time paths, by extending the model from Baker and Solon (2003) to include major-specific parameters. This allows us to test the role of prices associated with major-specific skills in wage inequality: our structural analysis of wage variance distinguishes between wage dynamics related to the evolution of the labor market price for skill and specialization and wage dynamics related to labor market instability and wage shocks.====The permanent and transitory components are allowed to differ by major and by cohort. The permanent variance is parameterized to capture persistent heterogeneity across workers not only in their levels of wages but also in their growth rates; it also captures evolving forces of skill supply and demand, and different prices among workers from different cohorts and educational fields. The model also accommodates permanent reordering of workers in the wage distribution. The parameters of the transitory component allow for investigating the role of labor market instability and wage shocks for determining wage inequality across majors and cohorts. The shocks are allowed to decay gradually over time to accommodate the persistence of shocks related to recession periods.====Finally, our paper is the first to make an extensive analysis of the evolving major composition and its impact on wage dynamics in the Russian context. The analysis is based on a unique data set built by coding text variables from initial open responses. Despite marked changes to higher education and the labor market, the literature is scarce regarding the particular period and setting studied in this paper. The rare exceptions include Gorodnichenko and Sabirianova-Peter (2005) reporting increasing returns to education in post-Soviet Russia, Kyui, 2016, Kyui and Belskaya et al. (2020) discussing heterogeneity of returns to higher education during its expansion; Denisova and Kartseva (2006) estimating wage returns to occupational specialization; and Rudakov et al. (2019) and Gimpelson et al. (2009) showing significant wage penalties associated with mismatches between educational and occupational levels and fields of study of the university graduates.====The paper is organized as follows.

I examine this relationship in the context of Afghanistan, where I show that the construction of the country's largest modern infrastructure project, a 2,200 kilometer highway known as the A1 or Ring Road, led to significant increases in local opium cultivation over the past decade. Estimates from a two-way fixed effects model that exploits spatial and temporal variation in district-level poppy cultivation and proximity to the road suggest that the introduction of a highway to a district is associated with a 650 hectare increase in poppy cultivation in the subsequent year. This cultivation increases the longer a district has access to the road: Production in the second and third years rises by 750 and 900 hectares over pre-highway levels, respectively. Estimates also suggest that improved highway access leads Afghan farmers to substitute away from the production of legal crops towards opium, and that more farmers grow opium as their primary income-generating crop. These findings suggest that in nations where the rule of law is limited and opportunities for legal livelihoods remain scarce, investments in physical infrastructure can inadvertently incentivize illegal economic activity.","This study finds that the construction of Afghanistan's longest highway, a 2,200-kilometer road known as the A1 or Ring Road, led to significant increases in opium production within the country. I first use annual variation in the geographic extent of the road over the 2004 to 2012 time period, along with district-level estimates of poppy cultivation, to show that districts in closer proximity to the highway witnessed significant increases in opium production. I then use household-level data on Afghan farmers to show that improved highway access is associated with a greater percentage of farmers growing opium poppies, and that the highway has incentivized these households to substitute away from the cultivation of legal crops towards opium. These findings suggest that in the presence of weak state institutions, infrastructure investment may inadvertently incentivize illegal economic activity. Such findings are neither abstract nor limited to Afghanistan: As the country supplies over 80% of the world's illicit opiates, the consequences of this production have international ramifications.====More specifically, the initial introduction of the highway to a district is associated with a 650-hectare increase in opium cultivation. Rough calculations suggest that this figure could translate into a 1.2 to 2.1 metric-ton increase in the heroin supply. Production appears to increase the longer a district has access to the road, as cultivation increases by 750 hectares over pre-Highway levels two years after the road enters a district, and 900 hectares three years after. The construction of the Highway within a district is also associated with a 4.2 percentage point increase in the share of a district's farmers cultivating opium poppies in the subsequent year, and a greater percentage of these farmers report opium as their most important crop. I argue that these results are consistent with a significant drop in transaction costs caused by the highway's construction. The reduction of such costs, coupled with a limited state presence and a lack of legal livelihoods, likely incentivized the production of the more profitable opium poppies.====A key theme of this paper concerns the effects of improved road access on local economic activity. Given the importance of modern transportation networks for economic development, this is a topic which has received significant attention in recent years. Using an instrumental variables research design, improved roads have been found to be associated with significant increases in household income and employment in Indonesia (Gertler, Gonzalez-Navarro, Gracner, and Rothenberg, 2016), increased manufacturing activity in India (Ghani, Goswani, and Kerr, 2016), and moderate increases in per-capita GDP in China (Banerjee, Duflo, and Qian, 2020). Conversely, Asher and Novosad (2020) find a negligible impact of road construction on rural incomes in India, while Faber (2014) obtains evidence that such roads reduce local GDP growth in China by slowing industrial output in more peripheral areas. While such results may appear contradictory, it is likely that the effects of infrastructure investment can differ substantially depending on context, such as the location or time period under study.====The latter point is especially applicable in the case of Afghanistan, a country with a notoriously weak central government and a limited rule of law. In these circumstances, road construction appears to increase economic activity, but it is disproportionately through illicit pathways. In fact, economic theory suggests that such pathways can manifest in developing countries when the potential payoffs from such activities, defined as their net rewards less the expected punishment if caught, exceed the livelihoods that can be obtained via legal means (Bourguignon, 1999). In these models, the volume of illicit economic activity will depend positively on its net returns, all else equal (Ehrlich, 1996). I argue below that the Ring Road substantially raised the net returns to poppy production, primarily by reducing the time and effort associated with transporting the drug to domestic and international markets. Meanwhile, the other determinants of this black market, including the profitability of legal livelihoods and a weak rule of law, were essentially unchanged by the highway's construction.====Importantly, Afghanistan's opium production itself is an issue of international concern. The country supplied nearly 90% of all opiates in 2009 (UNODC 2010), and this share has not dropped below 80% since. This production has not escaped the attention of the international community, which has invested considerable resources into implementing anti-narcotics initiatives to stem this global supply. Yet such policies have had little success in reducing cultivation: Forced eradication of the crop has typically exacerbated the poverty and insecurity which facilitate this production in the first place (Mansfield and Pain, 2008), while policies which seek to incentivize the production of other crops have only had temporary success in reducing poppy cultivation (Mansfield, 2016). In identifying a key determinant of opium production, this study contributes to our understanding of the factors which incentivize drug production and suggest possible avenues for reducing supply.====Finally, this paper contributes to our understanding of the circumstances under which development policy can yield unintended and possibly harmful outcomes. This is an important aspect of economic development, but it is especially pertinent in the case of Afghanistan's reconstruction. For example, Murtazashvili (2015) documents how procurement systems instituted by the international community incentivized Afghan firms to skim development funds via systems of subcontracting, leaving few resources for actual reconstruction. While traditional, local governance structures are often effective and trusted, provincial and national governments are frequently viewed with suspicion or outright hostility (Murtazashvili, 2016). Yet it is the latter entities which are primarily responsible for the implementation of development policies, and their lack of legitimacy is likely a key factor in the emergence of Afghanistan's drug economy.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 I discuss the economy of Afghanistan. Section 3 describes the data and methods used for assessing the impact of the highway on opium production, while I present the main empirical results in Section 4. I discuss some robustness checks in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes.",The unintended harms of infrastructure: Opium and road construction in Afghanistan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300706,31 October 2020,2020,Research Article,129.0

Which specific institutions change and the consequences of these changes nevertheless remains largely unknown. Change after a coup or transition implies that some form of political or judiciary barrier has been erected or removed. We therefore focus on what happens to the quality of judicial institutions and political ==== around coup attempts and other types of regime transitions. We hypothesize that when coups are conducted by members of the incumbent political elite, they are likely to remove barriers to change while coup makers outside of the ruling elite are more likely to do the opposite and thus protect themselves from what remains of the elite in the political system. Using the new Bjørnskov-Rode coup dataset, our results suggest that successful coups are associated with degradation of institutions, with successful military coups in particular having a significant negative effect. Results are more varied for civilian coups where we find indications of differences depending on whether the coup makers are part of a political elite or not. We also explore whether the incumbent regime influences the effect of coup attempts on institutional change.","Coups and regime transitions are events that are almost always intended to change the basic institutional framework of a country. During a coup some group, typically within the political elite or the military, attempts to take power through illegal, and often violent means. The reasons are regularly depicted as blind ambition and lust for power in the popular media, but often also include a desire to change policies and institutions in the favor of the incoming elite (Aidt and Leon, 2019; Bjørnskov et al., 2018).====What those specific policies are and what their consequences may be remains largely unknown. The intended policies and institutional changes are probably also diverse and context-dependent, as autocrats have incentives to suppress the population, as well as other potential parts of the political elite. However, they also have strong incentives to protect the quality of basic institutions and some degree of freedom of speech and media (Egorov et al., 2009; Boudreaux and Holcombe, 2013). In most cases, the successful implementation of new policies or institutional changes after a coup implies that some form of existing political or judiciary barrier must be removed. Yet, in other cases, it is an arguably more effective strategy for the new regime to increase certain barriers in order to protect either the regime or the policy and institutional changes.====In this paper, we focus on the institutional consequences of coup attempts and other types of regime transitions. Specifically, we consider what happens to the quality of judicial institutions and political corruption, an indirect indicator of institutional failure to constrain government (Damania et al., 2004). We hypothesize that when the coup is conducted by members of the incumbent political elite, they are likely to remove barriers to change. Meanwhile, coup-makers outside of the ruling elite are more likely to do the opposite and thus protect themselves from what remains of that elite in the political system. Further, the type of regime replaced may influence institutional change. However, all coup-makers are likely to be interested in actual gain for whichever group or segment they represent.====We test these implications in a large panel of approximately 10,000 observations from 169 countries, spanning the period 1950–2018. Applying new data on coups and coup attempts from Bjørnskov and Rode (2020), we find that successful coups are associated with increased levels of corruption (i.e., the sale of government property for private gain) and a reduction in judicial constraints (i.e., institutional safeguards to protect the independence of the courts from political influence). These results are driven primarily by successful coups by the military and are robust to controlling for whether a country has democratic institutions and the level of economic development. We also find that judicial constraints are reduced following civilian coups (i.e., those organized and led by political actors without a direct tie to the military) that fail. In addition, we examine whether the rank of coup leaders matters for the institutional effects. Our results suggest that successful coups by high and low ranking military officials are associated with increases in corruption and reductions in judicial constraints, but there is no statistical difference in the estimated effects of successful coups by high and low ranking military officials. We also find some evidence that failed coups by high ranking civilian leaders are associated with a reduction in judicial constraints. Furthermore, we explore whether the type of incumbent regime in place influences the impact of coups on institutional change. We find that successful civilian coups waged against military autocracies are associated with an increase in judicial constraints, but successful military coups against military autocracies are associated with a decrease in judicial constraints.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In their study of the evolution of inequality in China focusing on spatial inequality over the long run, from 1952 to 2000, Kanbur and Zhang (2005) identified two phases of inequality change after the start of reforms in 1978. After an initial short phase of falling inequality as rural incomes rose in the wake of the liberalization of the personal responsibility system, inequality rose inexorably as China opened up to the world and explosive growth took place in the coastal regions.====This increase in inequality became an integral part of the narrative on Chinese development, with some commentators arguing that this was the inevitable price to be paid for the high rates of growth, with others warning of the social consequences of rising gaps. In any event, “harmonious society” was given center stage at the 2005 National People's Congress and among rising policy concerns on inequality. As more data has accumulated, greater attention has turned to an examination of the evolution of inequality in China in the 2000s, including in the present decade—the years after 2010. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive assessment of what the data show, a deeper look into the patterns of inequality change, and preliminary explanations for the trends observed. Our basic conclusion is that Chinese inequality appears to be plateauing and, according to some measures, even declining. The explanations lie in policy changes and in the nature of structural transformation in China. We complement our own primary research with a review of the recent literature which, we argue, also gives indications towards a turnaround in Chinese inequality.====We then provide a preliminary account of possible explanations of this turnaround in light of Kuznets (1955) and Piketty (2014). Through detailed decomposition analysis of the inequality trends, we relate the turnaround to two classic phenomena in the development economics literature, the Lewis turning point and the Kuznets turning point. We further argue that for China there is evidence that both of these are in turn closely related to government policy changes.====The evolution of inequality as a country grows has been the focus of much analytical and policy discourse at least since the classic work of Kuznets (1955) and his inverse-U hypothesis that inequality would first increase and then decrease with rising per capita income.==== This focus has stayed strong right up to the present, as exemplified in the blockbuster work of Piketty (2014). Despite Piketty's characterization and critique of Kuznets (1955) as arguing for an inverse-U as a natural law, Kuznets himself did highlight the role of policy when he said: “One group of factors counteracting the cumulative effect of concentration of savings upon upper-income shares is legislative interference and ""political"" decisions….”(pp 8–9). In other words, for Kuznets (1955) as much as for Piketty (2014), policy matters alongside and in interaction with economic processes, and political economy is integral to the evolution of inequality (see, for example, Acemoglu and Robinson, 2002). We argue in this paper that policy is a key part of the explanation for the evolution of Chinese inequality.====The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 sets out the data sources on Chinese inequality on which our assessment is based. Section 3 then presents the basic trends over the 24-year period from 1995 to 2018. Section 4 places our findings in the context of the large literature on Chinese inequality trends, arguing that the dominant narrative of rising inequality has obscured a growing literature pointing to stabilizing of inequality. Section 5 examines the patterns of inequality change by looking, respectively, at decomposition by income source and by population subgroup. Section 6 discusses some preliminary explanations for the observed trends.

We further find that the declines in wage inequality were driven by large wage structure effects that compensated for changes in the composition of workers.","The issue of increasing income inequality is being publicly debated in most OECD countries. Many of the questions raised in these discussions center around the extent to which changes in wage inequality levels are driving income differentials. Much of the existing literature on this topic has focused on firm-level determinants, and has recognized the important role of inter-industry and firm-level wage differentials (Abowd et al., 1999; Du Caju et al., 2010; Krueger and Summers, 1988; Martins, 2004). We know far less about how between-firm wage inequality levels change over time, and whether firm-level factors have contributed to the increases in the wage inequality levels observed in many OECD countries. This paper contributes to this debate by investigating the workplace features that are likely to drive wage inequality, and how it changes at different points of the wage distribution.====While there is extensive research on recent determinants of wage inequality in the US, Germany, and many other advanced countries, this paper focuses on Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. CEE countries are interesting not only because there is little comparative evidence on recent changes in their wage structures, but also because the countries in this geographical region have experienced similar wage inequality trends. While the transition from a socialist to a market economy was associated with increasing wage dispersion (Brzezinski, 2018), we show that the wage patterns continued to change in the period that followed. Specifically, we find that whereas wage inequality levels further increased in many advanced countries in the 2000s, they stabilized or declined in Central and Eastern Europe during this period.====There have been several institutional and economic changes in the region that likely contributed to the observed changes in wage inequality. These changes, which we discuss in detail in Section 3, involved reforms of labor codes that increased workers’ bargaining power, increases in minimum wages, and large migration outflows to Western European countries. We argue that all of these developments had the potential to reduce wage inequality. There is a broad consensus that an increase in the minimum wage reduces wage inequality, as both its direct and its spillover effects are concentrated at the lower end of the wage distribution (Autor et al., 2016; Cengiz et al., 2019; DiNardo et al., 1996). According to wage bargaining models, workers bargaining power and workers outside options determine wages (Pissarides, 2000). Therefore, the increase in workers outside options due to the opening of Western labor markets should have led to an increase in workers wages in the CEE countries. These increases were likely concentrated at the bottom of wage distribution, as the demand for migrant workers was largely limited to low-skilled jobs (Black et al., 2010).====This paper has three main objectives. First, we aim to present a clear picture of the changes in the wage dispersion patterns in post-transition CEE countries between 2002 and 2014 using harmonized, comparative data from a large, linked employer-employee dataset of the European Structure of Earnings Survey (ESES). We study both the variance of wages and the quantiles of the wage distribution. Second, we intend to analyze the role of firms in determining wage inequality, and to examine how much of this inequality is due to wage differentials arising between firms, and to within-firm wage inequality. Third, we investigate the potential micro-level factors associated with higher or lower levels of wage inequality, and particularly the drivers of the observed decrease in wage inequality during the 2006–2014 period.====Our results suggest that during the study period, wage inequality levels decreased in most CEE countries, especially in the Baltic states and Romania, where the initial wage inequality levels were the highest in the region. In these countries, the largest increases in real wages occurred at the bottom of the wage distribution. This may be related to the fact that those countries experienced the largest migration outflows and minimum wage increases during the study period, as argued above. Czechia, where the wage inequality level remains the lowest in the region, was the only CEE country that experienced a (slight) increase in wage inequality, which was observed both at the lower and the upper part of the wage distribution. Czechia also had the smallest migration outflows in CEE, and its minimum wage expressed as a fraction of the average wage decreased considerably.====We further show that the differences in the variance of wages across the CEE countries were primarily driven by the differences in the between-firm component of wage inequality (and, to a lesser extent, by wage inequality within firms). We gain additional insight into the determinants of wage inequality by applying recentered influence function (RIF) regressions following Firpo et al. (2018). We show that workplace characteristics played an important role in wage inequalities; and that of these workplace characteristics, the levels of education and the ages of an employees co-workers were as crucial as her/his occupational and sectoral affiliation. Decomposition of the changes shows that reductions in wage inequality in the region between 2006 and 2014 were largely attributable to wage structure effects (changes in the wage premia paid for individual- and firm-level characteristics, as well as in the intercept), rather than to composition effects (changes in covariates). In line with Firpo et al. (2018), we find that composition effects increased inequality, as the gains were greater at the top of the wage distribution. However, unlike in the US, we do not see polarization in wage growth, as the changes in workers returns to wages were concentrated at the bottom of the wage distribution, and thus led to decreases in inequality.",Firms and wage inequality in Central and Eastern Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300597,21 October 2020,2020,Research Article,132.0

Intergenerational redistribution tilts in favor of the elderly when they are sufficiently numerous, but in favor of the young rich otherwise. We exploit a natural experiment provided by the repeal of compulsory voting in Austrian parliamentary elections to study how exogenous turnout decline affects intergenerational redistribution through pro-young public education spending in Austrian municipalities. Empirically, education spending falls when the proportion of elderly voters exceeds 21% of the electorate, but rises when the proportion of elderly voters is below this threshold.","How does democracy resolve the question of intergenerational redistribution? The answer, in part, depends on participation in the democratic process. In recent times both Brexit and the election of the U.S. President Donald Trump highlighted stark divides across generations where elderly voters had a disproportionate influence on the election outcome due to their greater propensity to vote.==== In the aftermath of the UK referendum, the young – overwhelmingly voting to remain – were blamed in the press for having brought Brexit on themselves with their low turnout (Marocchi, 2016). More generally the political consequences of the widespread age gap in turnout are a real and increasing public concern==== and have led some governments to attempt to redress the balance, for instance by recently reducing the voting age to 16 in Germany, Austria, Scotland and in some Swiss cantons. Compulsory voting also represents an attempt to level the playing field.====Prior research studying the economic consequences of voter turnout predominantly focuses on the income-based voting gap and its consequences for redistribution between income groups (for example Hodler et al., 2015). However the consequences of the generational gap in turnout are relatively unexplored. This is surprising because intergenerational conflict over redistribution is widely acknowledged==== and the generational gap in turnout has been recognized by political scientists since the 1930s (Bhatti et al., 2012). Understanding the mechanisms underpinning intergenerational redistribution is already of paramount importance as social protection systems in the OECD redistribute more resources across age groups than across income groups.==== Moreover ongoing increases in life expectancy will likely amplify the tensions already present.====This paper investigates how the abolition of Compulsory Voting (CV) affects intergenerational redistribution through public education spending. Education spending clearly benefits young households with children, but is of little direct advantage to the elderly.==== We first outline a simple theoretical model, building on the well-documented evidence that both elderly, and separately also richer voters are more likely to participate in voluntary elections. Hence falls in turnout are pronounced among the young poor. In the model greater (relative) participation of particular demographic or socioeconomic groups, compared to the benchmark of full turnout under CV, leads to greater weighting of their preferences in policy-setting. If the old place least weight on education whilst young rich voters place most weight, the effect of the reform on public education is ambiguous, depending on the size of each of the groups in the population. The key result is that when the share of elderly in the population is above a certain threshold, abolishing compulsory voting decreases public education spending as the old become relatively more overrepresented in the policy-setting process. However if the share of elderly voters is below this threshold, then CV abolition results in the pro-education young rich becoming more politically dominant, thus resulting in increased public education spending. Because the young rich represent a force countering the electoral influence of the old, this threshold is higher when the population is richer and the share of young rich, relative to the young poor, in the population is higher.====We empirically test these hypotheses for a legislative change that resulted in significantly reduced turnout in municipal elections in Austria: the abolition of Compulsory Voting in Austrian parliamentary elections. In 1992 the constitutional court repealed CV for parliamentary elections in four out of nine Austrian states. Because the legislative change was made at the national level it represents a quasi-natural experiment, and provides a source of exogenous turnout variation across municipalities. Below we make the case that the reform resulted firstly in reduced turnout in parliamentary elections, which in turn led to reduced political participation in general, and in particular reduced turnout in municipal elections. Austria provides an attractive setting for the empirical analysis for three additional reasons: First, the disproportionate political influence of the elderly has become a major issue in Austrian politics.==== Second, the Austrian municipal setting allows specific focus on the education share of the budget, as Austrian municipalities have considerable autonomy over their budget expenditure composition but not regarding tax setting. Third, when Austria abolished CV in 1992, no other concurrent reforms were implemented, while CV laws have often been changed as a result of wider political reforms in other countries (Electoral Commission, 2006). Thus the Austrian experience of CV abolition facilitates isolation of the effect of a reduction in the net benefits of voting.====The empirical analysis uses panel data covering more than 2000 Austrian municipalities for 5–6 municipal elections over 1990–2010, combining data from Austrian government accounts, population censuses and election results. We first provide evidence of the conditional effect of the reform on education policies. In the youngest municipalities of our sample (where elderly voters represent only 6% of the population), compared to CV, Voluntary Voting (VV) is found to ==== the education share of the budget by 19%, holding all else constant. Conversely, in the oldest municipalities (where the elderly share is 43%), VV ==== the education share by 29%. The effect of VV on education turns negative when the elderly exceeds 21% of the municipal population, which is slightly above the mean of our sample (18%). Second this threshold is found to be higher in richer municipalities: 20% in a relatively poor municipality against 23% in a relatively rich municipality. This is consistent with the theory which emphasizes two opposing forces under VV: the relative over-representation of the elderly and the young rich against the under-representation of the young poor.====Our identification strategy firstly requires that the observed heterogeneous response of public education spending (depending on demography) to the abolition of CV is only due to the consequent relative overrepresentation of the elderly and young rich in the electorate. Arguably the reform could have led to other compositional effects on the electorate, such as influencing the vote share for left- and right-wing parties, party competition or fragmentation, for example if it especially discouraged impressionable voters who traditionally used to vote for the incumbent or leading parties. However the data exhibit no relationship between these electorate composition variables and observed changes in abstention. We also explore the possibility that VV could have impacted fiscal policies in general hence only indirectly affecting education spending, but again find no evidence that policies other than education were affected.====Identification also requires a strong relationship between turnout in municipal elections and parliamentary elections. Clearly the reform meant that turnout in the parliamentary elections was significantly reduced in overall terms, and also significantly changed in terms of its demographic and socioeconomic composition. We argue that this in turn had a strong effect on turnout, and electorate composition, at the municipal level. Individual level data in repeated cross-sections from the Austrian Social Survey support this argument. Firstly the elderly’s turnout in parliamentary elections is virtually unaffected by the abolition of CV of 1992, in contrast to younger voters whose turnout fell meaningfully. The elderly are also observed to identify with particular parties to a greater extent than the rest of the electorate, implying greater benefits from voting. Furthermore, the elderly are also observed to have also higher levels of information and interest-levels in politics, suggesting lower costs of acquiring the political knowledge necessary to vote. Secondly, we provide evidence that the abolition of CV at the parliamentary level affected turnout in subsequent municipal elections. We further show that one possible mechanism linking CV rules in general elections to participation in local elections is that CV abolition is associated with a decrease in interest in politics, which reduces the benefits of voting in local elections.====The paper contributes to the literature analyzing the effects of voter turnout on public policies. Most of this literature focuses on total redistribution following Meltzer and Richard (1981), for example Mahler (2008), though here the focus is on the composition of spending. It also relates to an innovative literature examining how particular public policies respond to change in the composition of the electorate. Miller (2008) investigates how child health policies were affected by the enfranchisement of women in the U.S., and Fujiwara (2015) similarly examines how child health policies changed with the increased turnout of the less educated following the innovation of electronic voting in Brazil. Naidu (2012) examines how the teacher-child ratio fell in black schools with the disenfranchisement of black citizens in the 19th century U.S. South. Closer to our paper, Bertocchi et al. (2017) document that the youth enfranchisement through preregistration laws in the US shifted government spending toward expenditure on higher education. However prior to this paper the consequences of the overrepresentation of the elderly on intergenerational redistribution have not been analyzed.====An important precedent studying the effects of CV laws on fiscal policy in Austria is Hoffman et al. (2017) (HLL henceforth).==== Interestingly, they find that CV laws did not affect government spending patterns (in levels or composition) nor electoral outcomes at the state level. A first difference between HLL and the present paper is that their analysis is of state-level policy rather than municipalities - which enables a considerably bigger dataset. Secondly our finding of a ==== effect of CV repeal on public education spending is compatible with HLL in that we estimate a quantitatively negligible effect for the ==== elderly share - which potentially is close to the cutoff where the overrepresentation of the elderly and of the young rich offset each other. The repeal of CV thus reduces (or increases) education spending only in municipalities where the elderly share in the electorate is sufficiently large (or small).====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical analysis of how differential turnout can affect policy choices. Section 3 discusses the Austrian institutional framework and the data. Section 4 presents the empirical strategy and Section 5 contains the results.

Our instrumental-variables regressions exploit exogenous variation in the supply of Chinese exports, aid, and investment. Specifically, we use China's market penetration of developing countries outside of Latin America as the instrumental variable. In contrast to the widespread criticism, we do not find evidence that China's growing economic activities in the respective countries diminish average attitudes towards China—neither at the national nor at the provincial level. However, China's economic engagement appears to contribute to more polarized opinions on China: more individuals develop either very positive or very negative opinions on China. We interpret this as suggestive evidence that China's economic engagement creates winners and losers.","One of the keys to a country's international success is its image abroad. First, favorable opinions held by foreign citizens pay off economically. Economic research suggests that countries trade more with countries with which their citizens have stronger affinity (Disdier and Mayer, 2007) and a higher level of trust (Guiso et al., 2009). Trade ties are also stronger if citizens admire a trading partner's global influence (Rose, 2016, 2018, 2019).==== Conversely, a bad image can also impose economic costs on countries by causing foreign consumers to launch boycotts (Antoniades and Clerides, 2015; Heilmann, 2016; Pandya and Venkatesan, 2016). Second, favorable attitudes held by a foreign country's populace also appear to enable closer cooperation in non-economic dimensions of foreign policy (Nye, 2004; Goldsmith and Horiuchi, 2012). Public opinion is of importance since a foreign country's citizens can exert influence on political decisions regarding international cooperation by approving or disapproving of the actions of their respective political leaders (Milner and Tingley, 2013). Highlighting the role of public opinion, Goldsmith et al. (2014, p. 90) expect that the United States and China “increasingly seek to pursue their international interests through currying favor among foreign elites and publics” to avoid the economic costs that would arise from violent conflict.====Despite the economic and political benefits associated with “soft power,” the formation of attitudes towards foreign countries is poorly understood. The significant increase in Chinese economic presence in Latin America over the last two decades make it an ideal case to study the link between the international economic activity and public opinion formation in developing countries. Since the turn of the millennium, China has developed from being a minor actor with virtually no presence in Latin American countries to being one of their most important economic partners.==== China's sudden arrival on this continent stands in contrast to its widespread and sustained expansion in Africa and Asia since the 1950s (Dreher and Fuchs, 2015).====Unsurprisingly, China's emergence in Latin America is the subject of fierce debate among policymakers and analysts alike. The divergent perceptions held about China's developmental impact in middle- and low-income countries has been succinctly coined as “monster or messiah” (Sun, 2014) or “angel or devil” (Santiso, 2007) by scholars and policymakers. Latin American media outlets also paint a mixed picture of China's economic engagement. While China has been praised for its business potential, concerns related to sustainability, the environment, trade inequality, and intellectual property rights have received considerable negative news coverage (Ospina Estupinan, 2017). Under the assumption that individuals alter their attitudes in response to China's growing economic activities, we expect to observe that China's sharply growing trade, aid, and investment affect local citizens’ attitudes towards China.====Using representative repeated cross-sectional survey data from the Latinobarómetro, we analyze whether the growing amounts of exports, foreign aid, and foreign direct investment from China to Latin America affect individuals’ opinions of China across 18 countries over the 2002–2013 period. The relationship between public perceptions and economic cooperation is likely to be reciprocal: economic cooperation can influence perceptions and vice versa.==== To account for the endogeneity of China's economic activities abroad, we construct instrumental variables from the interaction between a time-varying exogenous variable with a variable that varies along the cross-sectional dimension (e.g., Werker et al., 2009; Nunn and Qian, 2014). Inspired by the “China shock” instrument of Autor et al. (2013), time variation of the instrument stems from the market penetration of developing countries outside Latin America with Chinese exports, aid, and investments, respectively. To account for potential confounding factors, our regression specification includes standard individual-level parameters, time-varying country-specific economic and political characteristics, and year- and country-fixed effects.====To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first multi-country multi-year study to investigate the causal effects of a broad range of China's economic activities on its public perception in developing countries. In doing so, we contribute to the literature on attitudes towards international integration (Scheve and Slaughter, 2001; Baker, 2003; Mayda and Rodrik, 2005; Kono, 2008; Mansfield and Mutz, 2009; Chilton et al., 2020; and many more). The studies closest to ours are Kleinberg and Fordham (2010) and Hanusch (2012). The former find some evidence of a significant negative association between Chinese exports and unfavorable views of China in a sample of 47 countries. The latter shows that Chinese exports correlate negatively with favorable public opinion on China in Africa but finds the opposite to be true for Chinese investment. Since both papers only rely on cross-sectional variation, both sets of results might be biased, for example, because China chooses the location of its economic activities based on favorable public opinion.==== Our paper offers a decade-long analysis with a causal identification strategy. It is also the first quantitative analysis of opinions towards China in Latin America; the existing scholarly contributions rely on qualitative evidence only (Hearn, 2012; Cornejo et al., 2013).====To foreshadow our findings, our causal estimates show no average effects of China's economic activities—be it trade, aid, or investment—in the respective countries on attitudes towards China. This null finding is robust to a battery of robustness checks where we introduce various changes to the sample, measurement of our variables, lag structure, and estimation method. This also holds when we analyze the effects of Chinese aid at the provincial rather than national level. However, China's economic engagement appears to contribute to more polarized opinions on China: more individuals develop either ==== positive or ==== negative opinions on China. We interpret this as suggestive evidence that China's economic engagement creates winners and losers.====Sensitivity towards the Chinese economic presence is high among the Latin American public. Chinese investors have a reputation of upholding low labor and environmental standards. In some instances, this has led to protests.==== Critics denounce that Chinese investors bring their own laborers and thus do not contribute to—or even crowd out—domestic employment (see Bräutigam 2009, p. 227ff for a discussion). These negative perceptions of China's development footprint provoked statements such as those made by Neil Dávila, then president of Mexico's federal agency for the promotion of foreign commerce and investments: “We do not want to be China's next Africa” (Fumento, 2014, p. 1). Carlos Zúniga, a Nicaraguan Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) negotiator, described China as “an awakening monster that can eat us” (cited as in Gallagher and Porzecanski, 2010, p. 1). The dramatic increase of Chinese exports to Latin America has also given rise to concerns about potential adverse effects such as the competitive pressure on local companies and the potentially negative implications for domestic employment (e.g., Jenkins et al., 2008; Sargent and Matthews, 2009; Jenkins, 2012).==== According to Gallagher and Porzecanski (2010, p. 51), Chinese manufacturing “threatened” 92% of all Latin American manufactured exports in 2009 in the sense that Latin American manufacturers’ market share of those products increased at a slower rate than China's (in some cases it even decreased). Chinese goods are often perceived as being associated with bad quality as well as with poor safety standards. This is why Midler (2010, p. 1) even refers to the label ==== as a “mark of shame” (see also Ramo, 2007). If such negative perceptions and experiences of China dominate among the citizens throughout Latin America, we would expect a deterioration of attitudes towards China as its economic presence increases.====At the same time, there are reasons why China's economic engagement could translate into an improvement of attitudes towards China over time. This could be caused either directly through economic benefits of trade, aid, and investment that accrue to Latin American citizens, or indirectly by the effects observed by peers or by what is portrayed in the media. First, regarding trade, economic theory suggests that consumers benefit as imports expand the variety of available products and yield lower prices (Krugman, 1979; Feenstra and Kee, 2009, p. 245f). According to the IMF, the strong increases of raw commodity exports to China were associated with significant terms-of-trade improvements for countries such as Brazil and Chile (Elson, 2014), contributing to their robust GDP growth over the past decade.==== Second, economists have argued that foreign investments can generally enlarge the existing stock of knowledge via training, skill diffusion, and other forms of knowledge transfer (e.g., DeMello, 1997). Such human capital development and potential spillovers from higher salaries paid by foreign firms to the work force employed locally would yield benefits for the domestic economy (Blomström and Kokko, 1998; Zhang, 2001; Görg and Greenaway, 2004). If such beneficial effects are apparent and salient to citizens, this could lead to an improvement of China's image. Third, turning to foreign aid, the Chinese government uses aid projects explicitly to promote friendship with foreign countries (Lum, 2009). Some Chinese aid projects, such as the China-Peru Friendship Center in Lima, even openly display this purpose in their titles. As argued by Goldsmith et al. (2014), in order to affect opinions, aid needs to be need-oriented, long-lasting, and visible. An important precondition is that the recipient population associates the aid project with the donor country (Dietrich et al., 2018). Ultimately, it is an empirical question whether individuals perceive an impact, attribute any consequences to Chinese economic activities, and—if opinions are affected—whether the positive or negative experiences dominate in the formation of their opinions.====In the remainder of the paper, we proceed as follows: Section 2 introduces the data and explains our instrumental-variables approach to estimate the causal effects of China's economic activities on individual attitudes towards China. In Section 3, we present our main results at the national level and test the robustness of these findings. The final section concludes and highlights the implications from our findings.","The effects of trade, aid, and investment on China's image in Latin America",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300627,4 October 2020,2020,Research Article,134.0

This conventional wisdom has motivated ubiquitous policies that limit public expressions of religion and emphasize secular values. This paper demonstrates that a policy change which undermines secularity ends up empowering women. The current article takes advantage of a unique divergence in political institutions that occurred in Turkey’s recent history to explore how revoking a headscarf ban affected employment outcomes of women in the public sector. In a difference-in-discontinuities setting, I exploit the before/after discontinuous policy variation and compare female employment within municipalities that have Islamist and secular mayors. I find that eliminating legal obstacles against observant Muslim women in the labor market improves female employment in Islamist municipalities. Yet, when women are not allowed to wear headscarves to work, Islamist mayors employ less women vis-à-vis secular mayors. Overall, findings point to unintended consequences of headscarf bans on pious women.","Religious conservatism, especially in Islam, is often associated with patriarchal values and deterioration of women’s rights. Scholars have underpinned this phenomenon empirically. Fish (2002) shows that controlling for the level of development, the condition of women is significantly worse in Islamic countries, and Donno and Russett (2004) posit Islamic culture as an impediment to achieving women’s rights. Consistently, Guiso et al. (2003) present evidence from the World Values Survey corroborating that Muslims are more intolerant to women’s rights and less favorable towards working women. Recently, a significant number of governments have voiced and institutionalized their concerns on the potential threats of Islamist conservatism for women by regulating the use of the Islamic veil, a conspicuous symbol of religious expression. Proponents of these regulations advance the argument that headscarf bans help counter the oppression of women and reaffirm the society’s secular character (Shadid and Van Koningsveld, 2005). Several Muslim-majority countries including Turkey, Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia have enacted laws that regulate women’s Islamic dress. The scope of headscarf bans is not specific to Muslim countries, however. To date, almost one third of the EU countries are enforcing bans on the Muslim veil, in response to the rising inflows of Muslim immigrants (Open Society Institute, 2018). Surprisingly yet, the prevalence of headscarf laws is unmatched by the scarcity of research on the topic.====Despite their prevalence, headscarf bans are highly controversial as exposure to a ban impairs education and labor market integration of pious women. Therefore, while their intended goal often is to reduce the visibility of religion in the public sphere, headscarf bans may inadvertently have undesirable effects for observant Muslim women, who are the most disadvantaged group in the first place. These consequences are not well understood, as there have been little systematic investigation of headscarf bans. Recent work by Abdelgadir and Fouka (2019) addresses this gap in the literature and finds negative impacts of the 2004 French headscarf ban on educational attainment of Muslim minority women. There is, however, no existing analysis of female employment over secular policies, particularly on Muslim women. The efficacy of headscarf bans on enhancing female empowerment via the labor market is ambiguous. On the one hand, Islamic values resonate with traditional gender roles that might deter women from participating in the labor market. On the other hand, secular policies might exacerbate the existing socioeconomic constraints by institutionalizing discrimination against pious women. The current article takes advantage of a unique divergence in political institutions that occurred in Turkey’s recent history to explore how revoking a headscarf ban affected employment outcomes of women. I show that lifting a headscarf ban – a policy change which undermines secularity – ends up empowering women by eliminating legal obstacles that discriminate against pious women in the labor market.====The contemporary significance of veil bans provokes two questions in particular. First, does Islam indeed undermine female empowerment? Second, can political secularism effectively empower women? The focus of the burgeoning literature on the effects of Islam on women has so far been limited to the first question. Few existing studies addressing how women fare under Islamist political rule find that women benefited from better healthcare in Egypt (Blaydes, 2014), attained more high school education, were less likely to marry young, and politically more active in Turkey (Meyersson, 2014). While the rising importance of Islamist political rule on some female outcomes has been documented, the implications for female employment has so far been largely neglected. The focus of this study is female employment, which is key to women’s empowerment because it enables financial independence. At the macro level, Muslim-majority countries have low female labor force participation compared to their counterparts with similar levels of development (Kuran, 2018, Donno and Russett, 2004, Bayanpourtehrani and Sylwester, 2013). At the micro level, Islamic values resonate with traditional gender roles that might deter women from participating in the labor market, as argued by Hayo and Caris, 2013, Dildar, 2015 and Bugra (2014).====  The unique empirical setting of the current study allows for causally testing whether Islamist political rule impedes female employment, which has not been studied to date. This study extends the evidence on the effects of Islamist political rule on women by showing that Islamist mayors improve female employment, but only when pious females can also be hired.====The implications of veil bans for female employment are uncovered terrain. This is the first study to demonstrate the labor market consequences of a pragmatic policy facilitating female employment for pious females. In 2013, Turkish government revoked a longstanding ban on headscarves for women working in state institutions. I exploit the before/after discontinuous policy variation and compare female employment within municipalities that have Islamist and secular mayors. I establish two important results in this paper. First, eliminating legal obstacles against religious women in the labor market improves female employment in Islamist municipalities. Second, when women are not allowed to wear headscarves to work, Islamist mayors employ less women vis-à-vis secular mayors. While the data does not allow me to identify pious women, I present compelling evidence suggesting that the increase in Islamist municipalities is due to employment of pious women who were previously banned from working in state institutions. Altogether, these results imply that what keeps Muslim women away from the labor market is not Islam itself but government regulations, such as a headscarf ban.====The equilibrium outcomes of revoking a headscarf ban are not trivial ex-ante. Theoretically, female labor supply will unambiguously increase with pious women entering the labor force. Equally plausibly, signals of piety such as headscarves may actually hurt pious women on the job market if they face discrimination from employers (Weichselbaumer, 2016, Blaydes and Linzer, 2008). Empirically distinguishing between these possibilities is challenging first because it is difficult to identify pious women. Beyond that, the decision to work is endogenous to cultural preferences as pious women are less likely to participate in the labor market. This paper overcomes both of these challenges using an original empirical setting and design.====Turkey offers an ideal testing ground for causally investigating the role of cultural barriers on female employment for several reasons. First is the existence of a universal reform which revokes the headscarf ban in all state offices. This dispels doubts that religious views of workplaces interfere with employment of pious women. Second, there is a suitable state institution where preferential recruitment can be observed: municipal governments have a firm-like structure where the mayor is responsible for the recruitment of municipality staff. Third advantage of the setting is the blending of religion and politics, which allows me to distinguish between Islamist workplaces where the elected mayor is from the pro-Islamist Justice and Development Party, and secular workplaces which elect a mayor from one of the secular parties. Veiling of the employees conveys a credible signal of piety and political inclination to the recruiting municipal authorities.====  Mayors from the Islamist party have religious and political incentives to hire pious women, while this is not the case for mayors from secular parties that have historically been ardent advocates of the headscarf ban. This distinction sheds light into why the equilibrium with headscarf repeal yields higher female employment. I argue that the removal of the headscarf ban reconciles cultural conservatism with clientelistic motives for Islamist mayors.==== ====I implement a Difference-in-Discontinuities (diff-in-disc hereinafter) design in the spirit of Grembi et al. (2016) which allows me to exploit two sources of variation – timing of the headscarf repeal and mayor’s political party – simultaneously and identify causal effects of a government regulation on female employment. Within this setting, I exploit a regression discontinuity in close mayoral races where the winning party is quasi-randomly determined, and constituencies electing Islamist and secular mayors exhibit similar characteristics.==== ==== Diff-in-disc is preferable over a more conventional Differences-in-Differences strategy in this context, because the Islamist party is more likely to get elected in cities where there are more women who want to wear headscarves to work after the headscarf repeal, precisely because more women want these jobs. Restricting the analysis to close races eliminates this potential reverse causality by empirically verifying that constituencies marginally electing Islamist and secular mayors are observationally equivalent. Hence, we would expect the proportion of observant Muslim women to be similar across municipalities that narrowly elect Islamist and secular mayors. Lastly, by a similar argument, while supply and demand cannot be distinguished from the data, the empirical strategy provides some demand-side insights of the observed changes in female employment, as elaborated below.====The purpose of this paper is to document novel insights on the repercussions of headscarf bans on female employment. However, although this paper presents valuable and credible causal evidence on the role of religion in female employment, its informational value is limited in external validity. Municipal jobs make up a small fraction of overall employment in Turkey and in many OECD countries. As such, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to overall female employment in the public and in particular the private sector. Another limitation of the paper is that the data does not allow to pin down the specific mechanism: Veiling signals intrinsic religiosity as well as political inclination.====The paper is structured as follows. I begin by providing an overview of the political setting in Turkey, which is followed by institutional background on hiring practices in municipalities (Section 2). Section 3 introduces the econometric setup and outlines the identification assumptions. I then turn to data, first validating the identification strategy, then presenting the empirical results, and testing alternative mechanisms in Section 4. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of the significance and importance of the findings in Section 5.",Unveiling the effects of a headscarf ban: Evidence from municipal jobs in Turkey,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300676,1 October 2020,2020,Research Article,135.0

However, consolidated democratic transitions, i.e. transitions that do not go into reverse for at least five years, increase FDI inflows, with the bulk of the improvement appearing 10 years after the transition. Furthermore, when controlling for political risk, the effect of consolidated democratic transitions appears immediately after they have occurred, suggesting that higher political risk in the early years of the new regime offsets their positive intrinsic effect on FDI.","In September 2014, in the aftermath of Tunisia's democratic transition, the new government organized an investment forum entitled “Investing in Tunisia, start-up democracy” with the aim of attracting foreign investors.==== The same year, the Thai premier, in power since a coup in May 2014, had told European investors: “We are not dictators”.==== These events suggest that democratic and nondemocratic leaders alike believe that democracy attracts foreign investors. Their belief contrasts with the popular view that multinational firms prefer to invest in authoritarian regimes (Oneal, 1994; Harms and Ursprung, 2002).====In fact, the evidence for the impact of democracy on foreign investment is both scarce and contradictory. A meta-analysis performed by Li et al. (2018) highlights the heterogeneity of the evidence. Table A1 in Appendix A surveys the 30 papers in which we found estimates of the impact of democracy on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. While 13 papers observe that the relationship is positive, five find it negative, and six find it insignificant. The last six find that the relationship appears only in some periods or if certain conditions are met.====A key difficulty in observing the impact of democracy on FDI comes from the interplay between democracy and political risk. The effect of this risk on FDI has been repeatedly documented since the early work of Schneider and Frey (1985) (e.g., Alfaro et al. (2008)). At the same time, political risk can vary in a systematic way with the level of democracy. This is particularly true during democratic transitions because young democracies are subject to a risk of autocratic reversal while they consolidate, as argued by Olson (1993), Acemoglu and Robinson (2001), Svolik (2008), and Persson and Tabellini (2009). By overlooking political risk, the possibility of reversal, and the timing of the effect of democracy on FDI flows, existing studies may, therefore, provide biased estimates of the true effect of democracy (Li and Resnick, 2003; Li, 2009).====In this paper, we address the difficulty of separating the effects of democracy and political risk by applying to FDI flows the method that was applied to growth by Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005); Papaioannou and Siourounis (2008); Persson and Tabellini (2006), and Acemoglu et al., (2019). This method was also used by Aidt et al., (2006) and Aidt and Jensen (2009) to study the fiscal consequences of democratization and franchise extension, respectively. In this method, we identify instances of democratic transitions in a panel of countries and observe how FDI flows change before, during, and after those transitions using a set of dummy variables. We apply it to a sample of 115 developing countries from 1970 to 2014 and address three questions: (1) Do democratic transitions affect FDI flows?; (2) is the effect due to democracy itself or to political risk?; and (3) what is the timing of this effect?====This approach allows us to circumvent the difficulty stemming from the association between democratic transitions and political risk in several ways. The first is to distinguish consolidated transitions from the whole set of democratic transitions. Consolidated transitions are defined as those lasting at least five years (Papaioannou and Siourounis, 2008). Comparing the results based on the whole set of democratic transitions to those based only on consolidated transitions allows us to observe how political uncertainty affects the estimated impact of transitions on FDI flows. Secondly, this approach allows us to directly control for the effect of time-varying measures of political risk and to determine the average time profile of FDI flows over successive periods around transitions. Finally, the method does not require us to measure countries’ degrees of democracy but only to determine whether a democratic transition occurred in a given country in a given year. Accordingly, it circumvents a longstanding debate in political science about how to measure democracy. This feature is useful, as the choice of a democratic index has been found to affect empirical results (e.g., Casper and Tufis, 2003).====Our results suggest that, on average, democratic transitions do not attract FDI but that consolidated democratic transitions do. The effect of the latter is robust to controlling for the impact of political risk measured by the ICRG index, implying that democratic transitions have an intrinsic positive effect on FDI inflows. The effects of a consolidated democratic transition materialize around 10 years after the event. When controlling for political risk, that effect is observable immediately after the transition. This suggests that new democracies attract foreign investors but that the political risk accompanying the early years of democratic transitions offsets their positive intrinsic effect on FDI inflows.","Democratic transitions can attract foreign direct investment: Effect, trajectories, and the role of political risk",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300640,1 October 2020,2020,Research Article,136.0

To answer this question, we leverage the quasi-experimental setting of the sharply increased military threat to the neutral country of Switzerland during the two world wars as an exogenous shock. In doing so, we exploit a unique feature of Swiss politics: government issuance of pre-referenda voting recommendations. We use constituent adherence to government recommendations as a behavioral proxy for trust in government, measured in real time prior to, during, and after the crisis. Our empirical estimates provide strong evidence that constituents are significantly less likely to follow governmental voting recommendations during wartime.","In addition to being an important factor for myriad economic, political, and social outcomes – including economic growth, tax compliance, infrastructure quality, better governance, voluntary activities, and altruistic actions (e.g., Knack and Keefer 1997; Putnam 2000; Uslaner 2002) – trust==== is an essential condition for government delivery of effective public policy. It is closely linked to regime legitimacy (Bakke et al., 2014) in that citizens are less likely to comply with the demands of an untrustworthy government (Tyler 1990; Levi and Stoker 2000; Torgler 2007), so their trust depends upon how well the government functions (Uslaner 2002). In recent years, trust in government has been on the decline in many countries,==== a drop that recent studies (including Dyck et al., 2018, Griffin 2017, and Abrams and Travaglino 2018), as well as media reports, link to such major political events as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency.==== This mistrust of national governance has strengthened support for populist platforms (Inglehart and Norris 2016).====According to the research, organizations are at particular risk of losing public trust in times of crisis, when feelings of insecurity and perceived lack of safety provoke an accounting of the ways in which, and reasons why, people cannot trust their leaders (Galford and Drapeau 2003). For example, several studies examine the decrease of trust in government in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis (Earle 2009; van Erkel and van der Meer 2016; Armingeon and Ceka 2013; Gillespie et al., 2012). This damage to trust may not be due to the crisis itself but rather because of how the crisis is handled (Galford and Drapeau 2003). It is therefore related to the quality of governance, which, when characterized by weak institutional effectiveness, can erode trust (Rothstein and Stolle 2008). Nevertheless, because the quality of political institutions affects both trust in government and the likelihood of a crisis, identifying the effect of crises on trust is a major empirical challenge in that real-world crises are seldom randomly assigned.====To investigate this issue, we adopt a broad dictionary definition of crisis as ‘a time of great disagreement, confusion, or suffering’ or ‘an extremely difficult or dangerous point in a situation’.==== To exemplify such a time, we use the sudden increase of military threat to Switzerland during the two world wars, which being completely outside the control of Swiss institutions and unrelated to pre-war conditions in the country,==== constitutes a series of exogenous events that can be seen as a quasi-experimental setting.====Although Switzerland maintained its long-held neutrality during the two world wars, the Swiss were justifiably fearful of being dragged into the conflict. Hence, on August 1, 1914, three days after the start of World War I, Switzerland mobilized its army and subsequently deployed troops in many areas – particularly to its border regions with Germany. The Swiss army and Federal Council held deliberations over which alliances they ought to pursue should Switzerland be attacked (Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz 2015). Likewise, when World War II broke out, the Swiss army was again mobilized within three days under the leadership of General Henri Guisan (Hale and Waite 2015, p. 126) and during peak operations comprised up to 850,000 soldiers – just over one in five of Switzerland's then approximately 4.2 million inhabitants (Schrepfer 1989, p. 53). Hitler despised Switzerland as ‘a pimple on the face of Europe’ (Wylie 2003, p. 165) whose people were ‘the mortal enemies of the new Germany’ (Leitz 2000, p. 14) and a ‘wayward branch of the German people’ (Leitz 2000, p. 14); hence, the Nazis devised Operation Tannenbaum, a comprehensive plan to invade Switzerland to be implemented after Hitler's armies consolidated their control over continental Europe. The Nazis even feinted an attack between Basel and Schaffhausen in May 1940 (Church and Head 2013, p. 213). Although the invasion never materialized, the threat to Switzerland was real, so Switzerland's maintenance of its neutrality through two world wars, rather than being an inevitability, could better be described as an accident of history.====To explore how such crises affect citizen trust in a nation's institutions, we exploit not only the exogenous wartime threats but a unique feature of Swiss politics – the issuance of referenda voting recommendations by the Swiss government. By examining the actual voting behavior of Swiss constituents relative to these voting recommendations, we generate a ==== proxy of trust in government that is observable over time. We thus make a useful contribution to a trust literature that otherwise relies heavily on survey and cross-sectional data, with their inherent empirical problems for exploring trust across time (Keele 2007). In particular, our estimates show that constituents are significantly less likely to follow governmental voting recommendations during wartime, suggesting that crises do have a negative effect on trust in national institutions. Our results are in line with experimental evidence on attribution error: Weber et al. (2001) show that group leaders are likely to be blamed for adverse outcomes, even when those outcomes are in fact independent of the leader's actions.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides stylized facts and theoretical considerations about the relation between crises and trust in national institutions and explains our empirical contribution's place in the existing literature.

While the greater attainment of men in competitive chess is well known, the lesser known fact is that the gender gap in competitive chess varies strongly across countries. For instance, for every 100 male players with the attainment level of Candidate Master, there are about 48, 47, 38, 4, 3, and 2 female players in Vietnam, Georgia, China, US (Japan), France (Sweden), and Denmark (Finland), respectively. Noting these large gender discrepancies, this paper constructs a cross-country panel to explore the determinants of these gaps. Controlling for main economic development indicators and several measures of gender equality, a legacy of command economy is found to be the most significant predictor of a smaller gender gap in competitive chess across countries. Various explanations and their implications are discussed.","Competitive chess is a male domain (Chabris & Glickman 2006; Bilalić et al. 2009; Blanch 2016). The July 2019 report of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) lists 1,643 male Grandmasters against only 37 females (FIDE 2019). This dramatic gender gap is one of the largest observed among the male-dominated domains, which include the STEM fields, financial trading, and senior management. The cross-disciplinary literature dedicated to the root-causes of the lack of female representation at the top levels of certain domains has been active for many years (Bertrand & Hallock 2001; Hyde & Mertz 2009; Lippmann & Senik 2018), where the two explanations of biological and socialization differences between men and women are put forth. Notwithstanding the interaction between the two explanations, the biology-based explanation implies that little or no difference in gender gaps must be observed across countries. On the other hand, given the prevailing sociocultural differences around the world, the socialization-based explanation is favoured if the gender gaps are found to vary across countries.====Interestingly, a close look at the FIDE data reveals a pattern of large cross-country variations. For instance, the 2012 to 2018 FIDE data indicate that for every 100 males with the attainment level of Candidate Master, there are about 48, 47, 38, 4, 3, and 2 females in Vietnam, Georgia, China, US (Japan), France (Sweden), and Denmark (Finland), respectively. In this attainment level, the global average is 6 females for every 100 males. Many would expect a smaller gender gap in the Western developed economies than in the rest of the world. However, the above figures imply a much greater relative female presence at the top levels of competitive chess in countries with a legacy of central planning than in the Western world. A review of the extant literature indicates that this pattern is not accidental. In the literature dedicated to the effects of socialist institutions and policies on the labour market, there is some consensus that women under communism had a significant gender equality advantage in comparison with women in the geopolitical West (Dijkstra & Hanmer 2000; Pollert 2003; Esping-Andersen 2013). More recent studies provide compelling evidence for the persistence of these differences post-disintegration of the Soviet bloc, within and beyond the labour market (Amini & Commander 2012; Lippmann et al. 2020). For instance, Lippmann and Senik (2018) show that among German pupils, the gender gap in mathematics is smaller in regions formerly part of East Germany. Consistently, Campa and Serafinelli (2019) show that women from the former East Germany place a greater importance on career success than women from the former West Germany. Informed by this literature, the present paper explores the origins of the significant differences across countries regarding female attainment in competitive chess as compared with men.====This investigation is instrumental in shedding light on several actively researched economic questions. First, the present study contributes to a better understanding of gender difference in competitiveness. Gender difference in competitiveness is attributed to both innate and contextual factors (Gneezy et al. 2003; Niederle & Vesterlund 2007; Gneezy et al. 2009; Frick 2011; Zhang 2019). If this gender difference is affected by contextual factors, then the gender gap in chess must also vary across countries. The comparative examination of the gender gap in chess provides further evidence as to whether differences between men and women in competitiveness are affected by societal factors. The second contribution of this paper is to the research agendas focused on documenting the cross-country differences in female representation at the top levels of male-dominated fields such as mathematics (Guiso et al. 2008; Hyde & Mertz 2009; Kane & Mertz 2012). The third contribution of this paper is to the literature that examines the effects of sociopolitical institutions on gender-role attitudes and beliefs, and the persistence of these effects (Alesina & Fuchs-Schündeln 2007; Amini & Commander 2012; Lippmann & Senik 2018; Campa & Serafinelli 2019). Finally, much of the related literature has relied on laboratory or field experiments, whereas this paper enriches the extant evidence by using real-world data.====The World Chess Federation, whose acronym FIDE comes from its French name ====, reports the official Elo ratings of chess players by their country of flag, multiple times a year. The Elo rating is a reliable measure of a player's chess skill, and is determined by the outcomes of FIDE-sanctioned matches. The 2012 to 2018 FIDE data of chess players’ Elo ratings, which contain more than 1.5 million individual observations, are complemented by other sources, such as the World Development Indicators, to construct a cross-country panel. The paper first showcases stylized facts on the level of gender equality in competitive chess around the world, which are both surprising and instructive. Subsequently, regression analysis is used in order to identify national-level variables associated with female participation and attainment in competitive chess. Controlling for variables such as GDP per capita, economic growth rate, and female labour market attainment, having a history of command economy is found to be the most significant predictor of a smaller gender gap in competitive chess, especially at high levels of attainment. The sheer extent of the gaps, unaccounted for by country-level economic performance indicators and observed measures of gender equality, provides support for the socialization-based explanations of female scarcity at the top ranks of male-dominated fields (Guiso et al. 2008; Kane & Mertz 2012; Lippmann & Senik 2018). Moreover, the results produce further evidence in line with the growing scholarship on the persistence of the effects of political regimes on gender-role attitudes (Amini & Commander 2012; Campa & Serafinelli 2019; Lippmann et al. 2020). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews the related literature. Section III is concerned with the data and descriptive statistics. The methodology is outlined in Section IV. The results are presented in Section V.

Moreover, technological similarity, rather than input-output linkages, plays a dominant role in explaining the knowledge spillover both at the firm level and the aggregate level, which indicates the importance of absorptive capacity in digesting foreign technologies. Overall, our paper sheds new light on the innovation policy of developing countries as well as the global business strategy of multinational corporations (MNCs).","Over the past few decades, emerging economies, notably China, have experienced impressive growth in technological innovations. It is widely believed that direct technology transfers from the OECD’s multinationals help these countries to gradually approach the technology frontier. But how large are the effects of direct foreign technology on domestic innovation and what types of firms benefit most from them? How important are geographical and technological distances in shaping these spillover effects? These questions have important implications for innovation and place-based policies, especially in emerging economies. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the impacts of foreign technology transfer on domestic innovation in the context of one of the largest technology transfer event in recent decades: the introduction of high-speed-railway (HSR) technology into China.====This paper contributes to the innovation literature by revisiting the empirical evidence on the localized impacts of technology transfer in two aspects. First, to isolate the role of technology transfer from other local impacts of FDI such as competition or backward linkages (Javorcik, 2004, Liu, Wang, Wei, 2001, Lu, Tao, Zhu, 2017), we exploit a major technology transfer event: the introduction of state-of-art high speed railway (HSR, thereafter) technology into China. Two features of this event make it an ideal setting to study the local spillovers of foreign technology. On the one hand, the scale and coverage of this wave of technology transfer were unprecedented. The two major train manufacturers in China, China Southern Railway Corp. (CSR) and China Northern Railway Corp. (CNR) signed technology transfer contracts with all of the four major technology providers at the time and introduced a complete line of HSR technology ranging from engines, dynamos, and electricity transmissions to railway signal control systems.==== Many of these technologies have applications beyond the HSR system and have great potential for technology spillovers.==== On the other hand, direct receivers of this wave of technology transfer are pre-existing CSR/CNR subsidiaries with R&D centers located in 14 cities. We collect detailed 35 information on the types of technology introduced and the location of the firms that received them. This creates plausibly exogenous changes in foreign technology stock at a very local level and allows us to improve on the identification strategy used in the literature by restricting our attention to cities with foreign technology receivers. In practice, using a difference-in-differences design, we identify the localized spillovers of this plausibly exogenous technology transfer event by comparing the innovation and economic performance outcomes of firms within 10 miles from the nearest technology receiver to those within 10–20 miles. We also propose an event study design that allows us to transparently and non-parametrically test whether or not firms that are closer to the direct technology receivers display differential pre-trends in technological development.====Second, compared with the studies in the literature, each of which focuses on a subset of indicators for firm performance, we assemble a comprehensive dataset that matches the information on patents that were applied for at the State Intellectual Property Office of China (SIPO) to firm-level variables from China’s Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASI) from 1998 to 2009. This allows us to explore a long list of indicators that trace firms’ innovation activities to their indicators of performance, such as productivity and revenue. One criticism of the use of patents as a measure of innovation in China is the influence of government policies in pushing for additional patent applications over time (Hu et al., 2017). We complement firms’ patent data with their performance measures to uncover the real economic impacts of innovation associated with technology spillovers.====The rich panel data on firms also allows us to explore mechanisms at work. To distinguish the effects of demand-driven innovation from those of knowledge spillovers, we obtain a list of certificated suppliers by the Ministry of Railway (MoR). We focus our attention on firms that are neither receivers of transferred technologies nor direct suppliers to China’s railway sector. Additionally, the local spillovers of FDI technology transfer hinge on the absorptive capacity of domestic firms. To weigh the relative importance of different dimensions of firm absorptive capacity, we construct measures of technological similarity and the input-output linkages of firms from the direct technology receivers. These enable us to examine whether or not the spillover effects on domestic firms are stronger for firms sharing similar technology to the directly affected firms or those with stronger backward input-output linkages. Contrary to the literature that usually identifies the greatest spillovers in backward-linked suppliers, we find that firms which share similar technology to the HSR sector benefit the most from the introduction of foreign technology.====We find that the introduction of HSR technology into China’s railway sector leads to a significant growth in patenting activities among firms close to the direct receivers of foreign technologies. Such effect is slightly larger for utility-model patents (petty patents) than for inventions (important and radical patents). Moreover, these localized spillovers are associated with ====, such as significant growth in total factor productivity and revenue. Our event study supports the parallel trend assumption of the difference-in-differences design, and suggests that it takes a few years for domestic firms to digest transferred technology and produce indigenous innovation, especially for radical inventions.====More importantly, we show that the effects are significantly larger for particular types of firms. Specifically, we find that firms with closer backward input-output linkages or similar technologies to the transferred ones are more likely to innovate more and experience higher productivity growth. However, when we control for both factors in one specification, the role of technological similarity dominates. In addition, at aggregate level analysis (city-technology class-year level), we also observe a significant increase in patent applications in technology classes that are closer to the transferred technology. These results substantiate the importance of technological similarity in boosting technology upgrades and productivity growth.====Our findings have a number of policy implications. First, our study evaluates a classic example of the Chinese government’s promotion of ‘====’, also known as ‘market for technology’, policies that aimed at helping Chinese companies acquire advanced technology from foreign multinationals by specifying technology transfer as a pre-condition for the entry into Chinese markets (Holmes et al., 2015). This could be a very important lesson to learn for both MNCs making technology transfer decisions and other emerging markets that aspire to develop technological bases from transferred foreign technology. Second, our findings provide evidence of the importance of absorptive capacity (Hu et al., 2005), most importantly, technological similarity, on the magnitude of technology transfer spillovers. Our results indicate that the greatest positive spillovers from the technology transfer are gained by firms close to technology-receiving firms and specializing in similar technology as them. Policymakers who want to maximize the impacts of introduced foreign technology may want to place it in cities where clusters of technologically related firms already exist.

However, we are not aware of a paper that convincingly rejects the efficacy of these reforms. In this paper, we define generalized reform as a discrete, sustained jump in an index of economic freedom, whose components map well onto the points of the old consensus. We identify 49 cases of generalized reform in our dataset that spans 141 countries from 1970 to 2015. The average ==== associated with these reforms is positive, sizeable, and significant over 5- and 10- year windows. The result is robust to different thresholds for defining reform and different estimation methods. We argue that the policy reform baby was prematurely thrown out with the neoliberal bathwater.","One of the most valuable roles for economists is to inform policymakers about policies or collections of policies that they could adopt which would reliably increase economic growth. Twenty years ago, the so-called Washington Consensus represented a fairly comprehensive list of such policies. ==== However, this view has since fallen far out of fashion. As Rodrik (2006, p. 974) noted more than a decade ago, “it is fair to say that nobody really believes in the Washington Consensus anymore. The debate now is not over whether the Washington Consensus (hereafter WC) is dead or alive, but over what will replace it”====Easterly (2019) argues that the disenchantment over the WC is due to two reasons. The first is the poor overall economic performance of Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa during and after reforms in the 1980s and 1990s. The second is that published papers showing a link between trade reform and growth were later shown to not be robust.==== Rodrik (2006, p. 974) provides a third reason, “the reform agenda eventually came to be perceived, at least by its critics, as an overtly ideological effort to impose ‘neoliberalism’ and ‘market fundamentalism’ on developing nations.”====In this paper, we argue that sustained, generalized policy reform along the lines suggested by the Washington Consensus may have been prematurely discredited. In a sample of 141 countries from 1970 to 2015, we use discrete jumps in the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom of the World index (hereafter, EFW), which is based on policies such as free trade, secure property rights, lower government spending, fewer regulations, and sound money.==== We find 49 usable cases of such generalized, sustained reform. We find a positive, significant, and sizeable short- to medium-term average effect of these reforms on living standards. The result is robust to the size of the jump required to be classified as a reform case and to the technique used to estimate the average treatment effect. Thus, we believe that this set of policies is worth seriously considering for countries that wish to accelerate their growth rates for up to a decade.====The two papers most related to ours are Estevadeordal and Taylor (2013) and Easterly (2019), in that they both argue that the WC, or at least some of its components, has been prematurely discarded. Estevadeordal and Taylor find that “liberalizing tariffs on imported capital and intermediate goods let to faster growth.” They find an effect of one percentage point faster annual growth. Easterly shows that while reforms might have been associated with short-run stagnation in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, growth since then has recovered.==== He goes on to demonstrate that extremely bad policies significantly reduce growth.==== Our paper differs from theirs in that (a) we use discrete jumps in an index of reform that broadly captures the main ideas of the WC, (b) we study broad-based general reform and not a specific policy, and (c) we incorporate recent work on issues with generalized difference-in-difference panel estimators in our empirical analysis.====There is also a large literature that regresses a range of economic outcomes on the EFW index. Hall and Lawson (2014) survey 198 empirical papers that use the EFW index (in some form) as an explanatory variable and report that in over two-thirds of the studies, economic freedom is positively correlated with a good outcome such as faster growth, better living standards, more happiness, etc. The authors conclude that the “balance of evidence is overwhelming that economic freedom corresponds with a wide variety of positive outcomes with almost no negative tradeoffs.”====The vast majority of this empirical literature runs linear regressions with the EFW index on the right-hand side to estimate the treatment effect. This is not ideal, as EFW is a constructed index of a limited range and is unlikely to have a linear effect on outcome variables. That is to say, it is extremely unlikely that a movement in the index from say 1.5 to 2 would have the same effect on GDP as a move from 5.5 to 6. We look for large, discrete, sustained jumps in the index and estimate the average effect of those jumps. As the correct cutoff for defining “large” is not obvious, we experiment with a range of cutoff criteria. For all of these reasons, we believe our results are a substantial contribution the literature on reform and growth.====Specifically, we identify a set of countries that experienced a discrete, sustained, jump in their level of economic freedom. We present estimates of the causal effect of these jumps on growth using matching on differences methods. Even though matching methods are less dependent than regression analysis on the choice of functional form and do not suffer from potential extrapolation bias, they are not favored among economists as a means of identifying causal estimates due to their inability to match on unobservables. To deal with this issue, we follow An and Winship (2017) and match on the first difference of the outcome variable (real per-capita GDP). As they put it, “Using the differenced outcome helps remove the effects of time-invariant factors while matching helps balance covariates and create a more focused causal inference.”====Matching also computes the average treatment effect as the simple, unweighted average of the individual treatment effects. In contrast, the more commonly used two-way fixed effects with a treatment dummy model (often referred to as a difference-in-difference model), does ==== do this if there is treatment effect heterogeneity, as De Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2019, hereafter CH) and Goodman-Bacon (2018) show. CH put it this way, “Linear regressions with period and group fixed effects are widely used to estimate treatment effects. We show that they identify weighted sums of the average treatment effects in each group and period, with weights that may be negative. Due to the negative weights, the linear regression estimand may for instance be negative while all the (individual) average treatment effects are positive.”====When we estimate a two-way fixed effects panel with the reform treatment dummy, we find a positive and significant effect of generalized, sustained reform on real per-capita GDP. However, the estimated effect is implausibly large and reform cases later in the period and in richer countries receive greater weight in determining the coefficient. For these reasons, we prefer to emphasize our matching on the differences results.====In what follows below, Section 2 reviews the Washington Consensus and discusses how the Economic Freedom of the World index matches well with it. Section 3 outlines how we define reform as a jump in EFW and describes which regions and time periods experienced generalized, sustained reform between 1970 and 2014. In Section 4, we discuss our methods, explaining the benefits of using propensity score or covariate matching on the differences methods instead of regression to deal with selection bias. We also discuss the recent literature that raises questions about how appropriate panel difference-in-difference estimators are for estimating average treatment effects when there is staggered adoption and treatment effect heterogeneity.

We derive necessary conditions for the welfare gain to be positive, and show how it can be decomposed in an effect of economic growth, a mobility effect and a cost due to aversion to time fluctuations given individuals’ ranks in the income distribution. The mobility effect, generated by reranking in the income distribution has two components: a cost due to time fluctuations in incomes and a benefit, due to equalization in time averaged incomes. We illustrate the analysis using CNEF data for Australia, Korea, Germany, Russia, Switzerland and the US. Our results indicate that the largest component of social progress is the equalization of time averaged income, induced by reranking. In countries with high growth (Australia, Korea and Russia), the growth effect is larger than the mobility effect, but in countries with low growth (Germany, Switzerland and the US), the opposite holds true. The poor performance of the US is explained by the large costs of income fluctuations and the way economic growth is distributed.","As more and more panel data for different countries become available, economists have reliable data about the evolution of individual incomes over time. This paper deals with the evaluation of such data on income streams for a population of individuals. Given that we observe the incomes of the same individuals during a number of years, how can we evaluate the progress made over time by the society consisting of these individuals?====Traditionally, economists have looked at the issue of social progress based on the evolution of incomes from varying perspectives. Some look at economic growth, measured by the absolute or relative increase in aggregate income over time. Others consider the evolution of cross sectional inequality, often measured by the evolution of the Gini coefficient. Still others focus on income mobility, measured, for instance, by 1 minus the correlation between individuals’ incomes between two time periods. In Table 1 we compute the value of these measures for six countries, using biennial data from 2001 to 2009 (5 observations per country).====Looking at these numbers, it is not easy to determine how the countries rank in terms of social progress. In Germany inequality increased and in Switzerland inequality decreased in each of the 4 periods considered, but in other countries inequalities increased during some periods and decreased during others. Perhaps we need only to look at the change in inequality between the first and the last period. That position is taken in the fifth row of the table and allows us to rank countries unambiguously on the basis of the evolution of their inequality: Russia had the largest decrease in inequality, followed by Switzerland and Australia. Next come the countries where inequality increased: Germany, the US and Korea. Absolute and relative income growth was positive during all periods for Australia, Korea and Russia, but the other countries experienced periods of increasing and decreasing mean income. Perhaps also here one can take the position that only the total growth from the first to the last period needs to be considered. In terms of total absolute growth, Korea ranks first, followed by Australia, Russia, the US, Switzerland and Germany. The ranking in terms of relative growth over the entire period is identical, except that Russia moves from position 3 to the top. These rankings are very different from the ones derived for inequality, making the integration of these two criteria into one ordering a non trivial exercise.==== ==== Moreover, we still have to consider what happened to income mobility. It decreased in Germany, Korea and Russia, but in the other countries it went up and down. Perhaps, if we need to rank countries’ mobility over a period of time, it makes sense to look at average mobility over that period. This is done in the last row of the table. Ranking countries from high to low mobility, Russia ranks first, followed by Korea, Switzerland, Australia, the US and Germany. However, it is unclear whether a high income mobility is necessarily desirable: on the positive side it equalizes lifetime incomes (which in the sequel we call time-averaged incomes), but on the negative side it increases income uncertainty, which affects risk averse individuals’ wellbeing negatively. Hence, the different criteria used often pull in different directions. Moreover there exist many ways to measure economic growth, inequality and mobility.==== ==== The crucial issue addressed in this paper is the development of a consistent criterion that evaluates and ranks countries on the basis of their social progress and takes into account growth, inequality and the positive and negative aspects of mobility. This criterion automatically determines how these different concerns have to be measured.====We propose a social welfare function to evaluate a profile of income streams, and evaluate social progress by the social welfare gain that is obtained relative to a profile of income streams in which individuals keep their first period income level throughout. Hence our welfare gain is equal to the difference in social welfares between the observed income streams of individuals and a situation of income level immobility. As suggested by Shorrocks (1978) and Chakravarty et al. (1985), our social welfare function depends on individuals’ time invariant equivalent income, the income which, if received by the individual in each period of time, yields the same utility as the actual income stream he received. Thereby we account for aversion with respect to fluctuations in individuals’ incomes. These time invariant equivalent incomes are then aggregated over individuals. Using a rank dependent social welfare function, as proposed by Yaari (1988), the social welfare gain is decomposable in four effects: (i) the cost of rank changes as they increase the fluctuations in individuals’ incomes, (ii) the cost of fluctuations in individuals’ incomes given rank, (iii) the gain of rank changes as they equalize the distribution of time averaged incomes, and (iv) the change in welfare due to the change in time averaged income. The total effect of income mobility on the welfare gain is thus ambiguous: rank mobility has a negative effect (i) and a positive effect (iii).====Our paper is related to several approaches in the literature. A first related approach uses standard social welfare functions to measure income mobility by comparing social welfare generated by the actual profile of income streams and a hypothetical immobile profile.====As social welfare depends on the distribution of some measure of individuals’ welfare, a first choice that needs to be made is the choice of individual welfare measure. Chakravarty et al. (1985) take in their main analysis the time averaged income of the individual as a measure of his welfare, but suggest that time invariant equivalent incomes can also be used. Aaberge and Mogstad (2010) argue that the minimal annual expenditure the individual needs to obtain his maximal utility level subject to his budget constraints should be used. If individuals can freely borrow and lend during their lifecycle, for constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution utility functions, the “equally allocated equivalent income” is a constant times “annuity income”, the constant consumption having the same present value as the actual income stream. Hence individual welfare can be measured by the individual’s annuity income, a measure of their permanent income. The absence of borrowing constraints makes fluctuations of incomes over time irrelevant for individual welfare. However, many households are confronted with credit constraints at some point in time.==== ==== For this reason, we follow Chakravarty, Dutta and Weymark’s suggestion and use time invariant equivalent incomes as a measure of individual welfare. This explains why, when there is a positive aversion to intertemporal fluctuations in incomes, components (i) and (ii) show up in our social welfare gain measure. They play no role in the main analysis of Chakravarty et al. (1985) and in Aaberge and Mogstad (2010). In our approach, this situation is mimicked by setting the aversion to intertemporal fluctuations parameter equal to zero.====The second choice concerns the aggregation of the individual welfare measures into social welfare. Chakravarty et al. (1985) work with quite general social welfare functions.==== ====
 Aaberge and Mogstad (2010) work with a rank dependent social welfare function. We follow the latter in the main part of our analysis, as it allows for the decomposition into the four terms mentioned above. Sensitivity analysis shows that country rankings are similar when an iso-elastic social welfare function is used.====The third choice concerns the hypothetical immobile profile. Chakravarty et al. (1985) generate it by assuming that in every time period each individual receives an income share equal to his income share in the first period. Hence, they assume income share immobility. In Aaberge and Mogstad (2010), the hypothetical profile is generated by assigning the lowest income in every period to the poorest individual, the second lowest to the second poorest and so on. In both these hypothetical profiles, the average income at each point in time is equal to the average income in the actual income distribution. Hence, these approaches deliberately abstract from the contribution of economic growth to social welfare.==== ==== As the evolution of aggregate income is an essential ingredient of social progress, we take as hypothetical immobile profile the situation where individuals receive their first period income in all periods.====Hence, as in Chakravarty et al. (1985) and Aaberge and Mogstad (2010), our framework builds upon the information provided by the whole income stream that is observed. The crucial differences with their approaches are twofold. First, we assume that income fluctuations cannot be costlessly smoothed by borrowing and lending, thereby reducing individual welfare. This gives rise to terms (i) and (ii) in our decomposition. Second, our immobile benchmark assumes that individuals receive their first period income in every period. Hence economic growth, captured by component (iv), is an essential part of our measure of social progress. This component is absent in both Chakravarty et al. (1985) and Aaberge and Mogstad (2010).====A second approach related to our paper judges the welfare gain between two periods. Bossert and Dutta (2019) characterize a measure for the change in welfare in a two-period framework, equal to the difference between generalized Gini welfare of the second and the first period, with weights depending on the rank in the corresponding period. It is not easy to see how this generalizes to more than two periods. Moreover, the approach is different from our approach, as we compare the welfare of the actual distribution of time invariant incomes to the distribution of time invariant incomes under the assumption of income level immobility.====Finally, our paper is also related to the more traditional economic literature on income mobility. Most of that literature investigates the role of income mobility in a profile of individual income streams over time within a two period welfare framework — see Atkinson (1981), King (1983), Gottschalk and Spolaore (2002), Decancq and Zoli (2014) or the survey of Jäntti and Jenkins (2015). The exceptions are Shorrocks (1978) and Fields (2010). They measure mobility by the extent to which it decreases inequality in time averaged income. Our decomposition shows that the positive effect of mobility on the equalization of time averaged income is important.==== ==== However, it is also recognized that mobility has a negative effect as it leads to fluctuations in individuals’ incomes over time, see Shorrocks (1978) and Gottschalk and Spolaore (2002). We develop a framework that evaluates income streams over more than two periods and allows us to trade-off these two effects of mobility, components (i) and (iii) in a coherent way. In our framework, this net effect of mobility can be compared to the size of the growth effect, component (iv), and the cost of income fluctuations given rank, component (ii).====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the framework, derives dominance results to establish whether the actual evolution of incomes is welfare improving compared to the immobile income level benchmark, shows how the welfare gain can be decomposed in four components, then considers alternative specifications to compute time invariant equivalent incomes and aggregate these time invariant equivalent incomes over individuals. Section 3 describes the CNEF data for Australia, Germany, Korea, Russia, Switzerland and the US that we use in the application. The results are given in Section 4. We find that the dominance results are useful, and that country rankings display some sensitivity to the aversion to intertemporal fluctuations in income streams and the degree of inequality aversion towards time invariant equivalent incomes. With plausible values of the parameters the positive effect of rank mobility on the equalization of time averaged incomes, component (iii), outweighs the negative effect on the time fluctuations of incomes, component (i). For countries with high growth (Australia, Korea and Russia), the growth effect, component (iv), is larger than the mobility effect, the sum of components (i) and (iii), while for countries with low growth (Germany, Switzerland and the US) the opposite holds true. We show that the ranking of countries obtained with our framework differs from the country ranking in the standard framework that focuses on transitions between two successive time periods. The rankings obtained with an iso-elastic social welfare function and a rank dependent social welfare function are similar.

But most studies on parental-child relations are associative, without control for estimation problems, such as unobserved intergenerationally-correlated endowments, if causality is of interest. The few exceptions are relatively recent studies that focus on high-income countries (HICs), with their much different contexts than the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in which the vast majority of children globally are growing up. This paper estimates the causal (conditional on the assumptions for the model) relationships between parents’ schooling and their children's schooling in the most populous LMIC, using adult identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins data from urban China. Our ordinary least-squares estimates show that one-year increases in maternal and paternal schooling are associated, respectively, with 0.4 and 0.5 more years of children's schooling. However, if we control for genetic and other endowment effects by using within-MZ fixed effects, the results indicate that mothers''and fathers’ schooling have no significant effects on children's schooling. Our main results remain with various robustness checks, including controlling for measurement error. These results suggest that the positive associations between children's and parents’ schooling in standard cross-sectional estimates in this major LMIC are mainly due to the correlation between parents’ unobserved endowments and their schooling and not the effects of their schooling per se.","Widely-held and long-standing conventional wisdom is that parental schooling, particularly maternal schooling, importantly improves many child outcomes, including schooling, in a wide range of economies (e.g., Haveman and Wolfe, 1995; King and Mason, 2000). This perception is one of the major reasons that many governments and international organizations advocate greater investment in schooling, particularly in females, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in which the vast majority of children – over 85%– globally are growing up (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2017; World Bank, 2018; Narayan et al., 2018). However, such a policy recommendation makes more sense if parental schooling indeed has a causal effect on child outcomes in LMICs.====But most of the many studies discussed in review papers (Haveman and Wolfe, 1995; King and Manson, 2000; Black and Devereux, 2011; Torche, 2019) on parental schooling - child outcome relations are associative, without control for estimation problems such as unobserved intergenerationally-correlated endowments. The few exceptions are relatively recent studies that focus on high-income countries (HICs). These studies for HICs attempting to identify causal effects of parental schooling on children's schooling use strategies such as identical-twins (monozygotic, MZ) fixed effects based on the assumption that parents who are MZ twins have basically the same genetic and other endowments, adopted children based on the assumption that adoption is random and instrumental variables based on changes in schooling systems. A causal study on a LMIC is still lacking.====The results on what roles maternal and paternal schooling play in their children's schooling in HICs vary. Most studies find strong positive paternal schooling effects and smaller or no maternal effects. Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002, 2005), in contrast, find negative effects of mothers’ schooling (that they interpret to reflect that more-schooled women, holding constant endowments, spend more time in the labor force and less time caring for their children) and positive effects of fathers’ schooling on children's schooling when they control for endowments (including individuals’ own and their spouses’) by using U.S. adult MZ data. Other studies find that the effects of fathers’ schooling are positive and the effects of mothers’ schooling are close to zero, including Antonovics and Goldberger (2005) using the same data as Behrman and Rosenzweig, Plug (2004) based on a sample of adopted children in the U.S., Bjorklund, Lindahl and Plug (2006) using Swedish adoption data, and Holmlund, Lindahl and Plug (2011) using Swedish twins samples. However, mothers’ schooling is found to have a positive effect on children’ schooling by Sacerdote (2007) using approximately randomly-assigned Korean-American adoptees, though the effect is smaller than that of fathers’ schooling in a sample of Norwegian twins (Pronzata, 2012). Some results based on an instrumental variable (IV) approach indicate that paternal schooling has no significant effects while maternal schooling has positive but small effects (Black, Devereux and Salvanes, 2005), or even large positive effects (Chevalier, 2004).====However, the data used for most adopted-children studies probably do not approximate random assignment of adoptees. Also, the IV procedure results in local-average-treatment effects (LATE) pertaining to individuals at the margin of being affected by changes in compulsory schooling regulations, not the whole distribution of schooling, and it is possible that different estimates would result were the instrumental variable a policy change that increases enrollment in higher education such as college openings (Currie and Moretti, 2003) rather than educational reforms affecting the bottom part of the schooling distribution. In contrast, the distributions of differences in schooling between members of MZ pairs tend to occur for a wide range of schooling levels, not just those close to the legal minimums (e.g., Behrman et al., 2011; Amin, Behrman and Kohler, 2015). For a full exploration of how parental schooling influences children's schooling, within-MZ fixed-effects estimates are likely preferable to IV approaches, because the former would be closer to average treatment effects rather than LATE, although the twins strategy is still far from perfect.====The most common criticisms of the twins strategy include unobserved heterogeneity in what determines schooling differences in twins that may directly affect children's schooling and measurement error that is exacerbated in fixed-effects estimates (Griliches, 1979; Bound and Solon, 1999; Kohler, Behrman and Schnittker, 2011; Amin et al., 2015). The twins strategy requires strong assumptions with respect to the random generation of differences in schooling outcomes between the twins, though these differences could be caused by random events such as injuries or assignment of inspiring teachers that can be treated as quasi-experimental. Even if possible endogeneity of differences in schooling outcomes between MZs cannot be completely ruled out, the within-MZ estimator is still found to be less biased than the OLS estimator (Li, Liu and Zhang, 2012). Some also claim that there is a problem of external validity because twins differ from the whole population (e.g., lower birth weight distributions). However the control for endowments in the within-MZ estimates controls for whatever ways that MZs differ from the larger population (Kohler, Behrman and Schnittker, 2011; Amin et al., 2015; Lundborg et al., 2016).====This study helps fill the gap in the literature on causal studies of parental schooling on children's schooling in LMICs. We use Chinese adult twins data to estimate the causal net effects of parents’ schooling on children's schooling by applying the MZ fixed-effects strategy of Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002), as well as the causal gross effects using the standard within-MZ approach. The Chinese Twins Survey contains information on schooling attainment for the MZ twins respondents, their spouses and their children. In addition, it includes information on earnings on the current job and work time for both the respondents and their spouses and reports of each twin on the other twin's schooling and on the other twin's spouse's schooling. This dataset is the first socioeconomic adult twins dataset for China and, to our knowledge, for LMICs more generally. It allows us to study the causal relationship between parental schooling and their children's schooling by controlling for unobserved individual-specific endowment components.====In China, the increasingly heated issue of intergenerational mobility has drawn more and more attention both from the public and from scholars. A number of recent studies focus on the intergenerational transmission between parents and their children of schooling (Golley and Kong, 2013) or income (Guo and Min, 2008; Gong, Leigh and Meng, 2012). But most of these studies are descriptive and do not investigate causal relations between parents’ schooling and children's schooling. And none of them employs twins data to control for omitted ability, motivation and family background. It is well-known that positive correlations between schooling and heritable ability and other unobserved factors will likely lead to upward bias in OLS estimates of cross-sectional relations between the schooling of parents and their children. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate the causal effect of parents’ schooling on their children's schooling using adult twins data in China and in LMICs more broadly.====Consistent with previous results from conventional cross-section studies, our OLS estimates show positive relationships between the schooling of both parents and their children's schooling. Specifically, one-year increases in maternal and parental schooling are associated with higher children's schooling by 0.4 and 0.5 years, respectively. However, after controlling for individuals’ own endowments and the schooling and endowments of their spouses by applying within-MZ fixed effects, we find that maternal and paternal schooling effects are insignificant.====Our study contributes to the recent scholarly literature on causal effects of parents’ schooling on children's schooling in a much different LMIC context than the previous studies on HICs. Our findings also are important for policy makers. If parents’ schooling is largely responsible for creating an environment in which children can learn more and prosper, then increasing the schooling of one generation ==== will have long-term consequences through intergenerational spillover effects on subsequent generations. However, if inherited abilities and other endowments account for children's success in school, then improving schooling for one generation may have limited effect on the next generation. Rather than try to boost children's schooling in part via the parental channel, governments should shift focus to more direct interventions, such as early childhood programs and universal access to kindergarten, especially for the poor and disadvantaged.====This paper is structured as follows.

Exploiting geographic variations in trust across Italian regions and the occurrence of the 2008-09 financial crisis in a difference-in-differences setting, we show that generalized trust makes family firms less able to obtain trade financing during the crisis. This finding maps into performance results: trust ==== the negative effect of a crisis for non-family firms, while it ","There is a large evidence that financial crises harm companies by limiting the availability of bank credit (Campello et al. 2010; Kahle and Stulz 2013). An important question within this literature is whether family firms – a common organization around the world (Anderson and Reeb 2003; Faccio and Lang 2002) – are better or worse positioned than non-family firms to deal with financial crises.====The ability of companies to weather a financial crisis depends not only on firm-specific characteristics such as financial strength (Duchin et al. 2010) but also on contextual elements such as the cultural values in the area where firms operate.==== Along this line, Levine et al. (2018) show that, by fostering cooperation among business partners, generalized trust raises the amount of trade financing available to companies. The key mechanism here is that, by reflecting beliefs of trustworthiness in others’ behavior (Sapienza et al. 2013), trust improves contractual relationships (Bromiley and Cummings 1995; Dyer and Chu 2003).====Unfortunately, existing assessments of the role of trust for the financing ability of firms have largely ignored the role of ownership types. Stacchini and Degasperi (2015) make a useful step in this direction, but their work only looks at the supply of bank debt to family firms and non-family firms during a crisis. We contribute to this literature by focusing on trade financing, which represents a primary source of financing when bank credit dries up (Garcia-Appendini and Montoriol-Garriga 2013), as well as on firm performance. More specifically, we address the novel question of whether family firms are better or worse than non-family firms at accessing this alternative funding source and sustaining performance in a crisis as a function of the level of generalized trust in the geographic area of the firm's headquarter.====The effect of family ownership on trade financing during crises is theoretically unclear. On the one hand, family ties provide networking advantages (Amore and Bennedsen 2013; Bertrand and Schoar 2006; Bunkanwanicha et al. 2013), which could facilitate the access to trade financing. On the other hand, family firms – especially those led by family heirs – tend to display poorer corporate governance (Bloom and Van Reenen 2007) and greater informational opaqueness (Anderson et al. 2009), which can be costly in tightening credit markets. In a high-trust context, impersonal market transactions tend to be more prominent and entrenchment is punished more severely (e.g. Tabellini 2010); hence, suppliers facing greater uncertainty and binding financial constraints due to a crisis would favor firms with sound corporate governance. These arguments suggest that generalized trust hampers the ability of family firms to reap the benefit of networking and exacerbate the downside of opaqueness as they strive to access trade financing in hard times.====We conduct the analysis on a panel dataset of 14,337 firms in Italy from 2004 to 2009 (a period including both non-crisis and crisis years). The Italian context benefits from well-documented differences in generalized trust across regions, whose origins date back to the Middle Ages (Guiso et al. 2016; Putnam 1993) and are largely exogenous to current firm outcomes. Our analysis identifies the heterogeneous response to the financial crisis by companies that have different owners but that are located in the same (high or low trust) area. In particular, we employ a difference-in-differences approach in which the longitudinal variation is given by the crisis years of 2008-09 and the cross-sectional variation is given by the level of generalized trust in the region of headquarter of family and non-family firms.====We find that a crisis makes family firms less able to obtain trade financing in areas where trust is high. The financial crisis has a negative effect on the trade financing of both family and non-family firms, ranging between 3.5 and 4.3 percentage points with respect to the average value; however, for family firms trust amplifies the negative effect by 0.8 percentage points. Going beyond the comparison between family and non-family firms, we study the role of corporate governance within family firms. Results show that the negative effect of trust on trade financing during a crisis is significant for family firms with only family directors; by contrast, trust does not alter the effect of financial crisis on the trade financing of family firms with any non-family director. This heterogeneity is consistent with the view that during a crisis informational opaqueness becomes costlier in high-trust contexts – a cost which family firms with boards open to non-family directors are able to mitigate.====Next, we focus on firm performance. As expected, the financial crisis had a negative effect on operating profitability (i.e. return on assets, ROA). Moreover, trust reduces this negative effect – though this is true only for non-family firms. For family firms, trust ==== the negative effect of the financial crisis on profitability. The direct effect of the crisis corresponds to a 1.3 to 2 percentage points drop from the average ROA of 9%; while trust reduces this drop by 0.4 percentage points for non-family firms, it exacerbates it by 0.3 percentage points for family firms. Similar to trade financing, the negative profitability effect is absent for family firms that feature non-family members in the board of directors.====These findings hold controlling for time-invariant heterogeneity at the firm level (thus removing fixed differences between family and non-family firms) and for multiple sources of omitted factor bias. Moreover, we validate the assumption of parallel trends in profitability before the crisis necessary for the causal interpretation of our results. Finally, we address concerns of endogeneity in family ownership by exploiting the historical variations in managerial practices across Italian provinces provided by the US Productivity Program (Giorcelli 2019).====Recent works have analyzed the role of trust during periods of credit contraction. Lins et al. (2017) find a positive effect of firm-level social capital and trust on stock returns during a financial crisis, whereas Levine et al. (2018) show that trust increases trade financing thus alleviating the negative effect of liquidity crises on firm activities. Our contribution is to document the underexplored complementarity between cultural values, and firm ownership and governance structures in determining which firms are better positioned to perform during a crisis. As such, we move beyond Stacchini and Degasperi (2015), who show that family firms face lower bank loan spreads in low-trust areas. Here our contribution is threefold. First, we study trade financing, which represents a key funding source during financial crises (Garcia-Appendini and Montoriol-Garriga 2013). Second, our identification separates the effect of trust from other regional characteristics and also accounts for the endogeneity of family ownership through an historical instrument. Third, we explore the important role of corporate governance in shaping the nexus between trust and crisis – and show that boards drive significant differences in our results.====Our work also relates to a literature on the interaction between institutional characteristics and corporate governance (e.g. Cosset et al. 2016). While this research has shown the importance of governance quality to overcome financial shocks, the question of how firms’ ownership interacts with cultural values remains largely underexplored. By showing a significant intertwinement between the identity of firm owners and generalized trust, our findings expand the literature on the importance of cultural values for firms’ organization (Bloom et al. 2012; Bottazzi et al. 2016; Chami and Fullenkamp 2002; Hilary and Huang 2015; La Porta et al. 1997).====Accounting for institutional (e.g. Burkart et al. 2003; Mueller and Philippon 2011) and cultural factors (e.g. Amore 2017; Bertrand and Schoar 2006) helps to explain the diffusion of family businesses and understand when these firms perform better or worse than others. For instance, Amit et al. (2015) show that family firms outperform in areas where institutional efficiency is high. Miller et al. (2017) show that family-managed firms outperform other family firms in areas where family values are counteracted by market values. Our work contributes to this literature by showing the role of ownership and governance attributes in the wake of a financial shock.",Riding out of a financial crisis: The joint effect of trust and corporate ownership,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759672030041X,31 July 2020,2020,Research Article,143.0

The number of seats in parliament per constituency is effectively random. This setting permits us to investigate institutionally driven variations in the magnitude of individual constituencies on the allocation of federal resources to these constituencies. We analyze the causal effect of having more than one federal legislator per constituency on federal government resources by exploiting information from 1,379 constituencies from 1998 to 2017. More federal legislators per constituency lead to statistically significantly more employment of federal civil servants. The size of the effect is large and corresponds to about 3.5% of average employment once a constituency is represented by additional legislators from party lists. Robustness tests support our results. Further evidence points to heterogeneity of the effect: Constituencies represented by additional legislators who are experienced and who are members of larger, competing parties obtain more federal resources.","When allocating common federal resources, a constituency's share may not only depend on ==== represents it in parliament but also on ==== legislators represent it. We investigate how electoral district magnitude, i.e. the number of legislators per constituency, affects political representation. In particular, we analyze whether more federal legislators per constituency lead to more federal resources for the respective constituency.====Legislators aim to target their constituencies with public projects to improve their re-election probability.==== Since these projects are often financed from the common budget, the costs are shared among all constituencies which leads to a ==== (Weingast et al., 1981; Velasco 2000) and the associated law of 1/n stipulates that a higher number of legislators leads to excessive government spending and an increasing public sector if legislators do not internalize the shared financing costs.====While there is ample evidence that the local electorate profits from more political representation (e.g. Egger and Köthenbürger 2010; Aidt and Shvets 2012; Jennes and Persyn 2015; Fiva and Halse 2016; Maaser and Stratmann 2016; Gehring and Schneider 2018; Fritz and Feld 2019; Zhang 2020), there is also evidence to the contrary (see e.g. Pettersson-Lidbom 2012; Berry and Fowler 2016). The modern literature tries to account for endogeneity issues when analysing political representation by employing methods of quasi-randomization. However, such approaches do not always fulfill all requirements for identification and institutional details matter (Eggers et al., 2018).====We contribute to the literature by employing a methodologically innovative strategy to identify the effect of having more legislators per constituency on the federal resources that constituencies receive. The German mixed-member electoral system institutionally assures the exogeneity of the number of legislators per constituency. The ==== (federal parliament) is comprised of directly elected legislators for each constituency and legislators from state-wide party lists. While every constituency is always represented by one directly elected legislator in the ====, the total number of representatives per constituency can be higher as further legislators may enter parliament through state-wide party lists. This is possible since candidates can run as direct candidates for their constituency and as party list candidates simultaneously. Candidates who do not win a plurality in their district race can still profit from their fall-back option and enter parliament through the state-wide party list. District magnitude is effectively random from the point of view of a constituency. Candidates’ ranks on the party lists are independent of constituency specific characteristics and it is unknown prior to election how many legislators from the constituency finally enter parliament through state-wide party lists. Thus, we can analyze the effect of exogenous differences in legislative representation of constituencies.====We employ a dataset of 1379 German constituencies between 1998 and 2017 to analyze the impact of the number of legislators per constituency on the allocation of federal resources employing fixed effects. Federal resources are captured by the number of federal civil servants who work in a constituency. Additional federal representation by legislators elected through the party lists increases the number of federal civil servants by 0.22 per thousand inhabitants or 37 more civil servants in comparison to constituencies that have only one directly elected legislator. Thereby, having more than one legislator per constituency translates into to a 3.5% increase in federal employment compared to the mean number of federal civil servants. The impact of more legislators is statistically significant and remains robust to the inclusion of a variety of political control variables including local ties, positions on the party list, committee memberships and belonging to parties in government. The results also hold in diverse subsample estimations. Regarding mechanisms, constituencies particularly profit when they are represented (1) by more experienced legislators, (2) by legislators who also live in the constituency or (3) by legislators who are from the larger parties and who compete to win the direct seat of the constituency.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II relates our contribution to the literature.

We put these developments in the context of the structural and reform developments in transition economies. We rely on the predictions of the efficient bargaining model, whereby globalization forces are set to affect workers’ market bargaining power, which then produces certain developments in the labor share. We use industry-level data for 23 transition economies of Central and Southeast Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States over the late transition period of 2000–2015. Results robustly suggest that globalization forces played important role for the stagnant labor shares in transition economies, mainly in low-skill ====. Workers’ shares in high-skill industries largely remained intact. Results further suggest that the negative effect has been the strongest for the low-skilled workers in the early transition phase and then lessened or vanished as countries turned a higher development stage. The key finding advises that if governments of transition countries attempted to or undertook steps to seize globalization by offering ‘cheap labor’, then it has been the wrong strategy.","In a standard trade theory framework, global trade and finance flows increase the efficient allocation of resources, resulting in higher and diversified growth, more jobs, economies’ restructuring and spillover of technical innovation (Krugman and Obstfeld, 1994; Estrin et al., 1997; Prasad et al., 2005). Globalization increases the demand for the abundant factor of production, hence increasing its price. If the abundant factor is labor, then wages should rise, implying that workers gain more from the national income ‘pie’. However, greater factor mobility – both of capital due to race for attracting investment and of labor due to eased outward migration – under globalization may have impaired bargaining power of workers, corroding their share in total income.====Transition economies opened their markets to the forces of globalization in early 1990s. At that time, most of them faced fierce competition from the global market, against the losing of their traditional ones (which were usually secured because of the existence of one large central-planning state), which all resulted in a severe collapse of the output. Transition, convoyed with the privatization of the state-owned capital, was frequently accompanied by erosion of the physical and human capital and many transition economies saw years of disinvestment in machinery and massive lay-offs which made skills obsolete. The latter was predominantly a consequence of the inefficient use of labor resources under socialism (Lehmann and Muravyev, 2012). Hence, idle labor was surmounting, workers’ power and wages falling, despite patterns may have been heterogeneous across countries (Svenjar, 1999). Except for few transitioners (mainly being the Visegrad countries), majority of them consolidated only late (late-1990s and early 2000s), yet recognizing that their key economic problem remained to be large and structural unemployment. However, integration into the global trade flows was inevitable as many transition economies opened to trade – despite exporting concentrated and low-value-added products. Later, many of them started programs based on state aid to attract FDIs under the implicit offering of ‘cheap labor’.====Existing yet scarce data on transition economies suggest that labor share in total income has been stagnant at best. The simple average share of the compensation of employees in total expense has been ranging from 14.4% in the 1990s to 16.9% in the 2000s and moderating at 16.7% in the 2010s. Likewise, the labor share in manufacturing moderated from 15.6% in 2000 to 15% in 2015 (World Development Indicators). Hence, the question is if globalization, perplexed with a combination of structural transition characteristics, prevented labor share to significantly increase in transition economies. This paper aims to investigate this issue.====The issue of the labor share developments gained attention in the global literature, despite predominantly for the industrialized countries. For example, Blanchard (1997) and Bentolila and Saint-Paul (2003) and Piketty and Zucman (2014) document changes in labor and capital shares in the OECD countries or their subgroups, while Poterba (1997) and Elsby et al. (2013) in the United States. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) document labor share declines in an industrialized panel of 59 countries. Guerriero (2019) achieves the same concusion with a panel of 151 country overa 45-year span and thorough consideration of labor share measurements. Crotty and Epstein (1996), Rodrick (1997), Harrison (2005) and Guscina (2006) focus on the role of globalization for the labor share in industrialized countries, inferring its predominantly eroding effect.====We undertake an approach rooted in the bargaining literature, to be able to both theoretically and empirically establish the potential negative effects of globalization on labor share in transition economies. To that end, we employ an estimable version of the bargaining model, whereby labor share is a function of labor productivity, endowments, fixed costs of capital and labor to relocate and their alternative returns abroad. We observe labor shares and productivity at the industry level, securing space to capture inter-industrial developments, particularly in the light of skill intensity. We empirically investigate this model in a dynamic framework with past values of the variables used as instruments. The period 2000–2015 is captured for a total of 23 transition economies of Central and Southeast Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.====Defined this way, the paper brings a couple of novelties to the current sparse of discussions in the literature and in transition policy circles. First, it is among the few papers dealing with the issue in transition economies, and probably the only one for these countries framing the relations in a robust theoretical framework. Second, the paper is the first to analyze labor shares at the industry level, which is an aspect discussed at theoretical levels, but rarely pursued empirically due to its data requirements. Third, through relying on fixed costs for relocation and alternative returns of capital and labor, the paper examines genuine structural characteristics of transition economies, like their reforms in the enterprise, trade and foreign exchange policies, accelerated outward migration rates and deteriorations in market bargaining power. More so, by dwelling on skill intensity at industry level, the paper delves into the attempt of major part of transition economies to utilize globalization fruits through offering ‘cheap labor’.====Results robustly suggest that globalization forces played instrumental role for the stagnant labor shares in transition economies over the observed period, particularly for the low-skill industries. Results further suggest that the negative effect has been the strongest for the low-skilled workers in the early transition phase and then lessened or vanished as countries turned a higher stage of their development.====The paper is organized as follows.

On the one hand, women facing a risk of kidnapping may reduce education investment due to uncertain returns. Alternatively, since kidnapping is less likely to occur while a woman is in school, women may increase education investment to lower their personal risk of being kidnapped into marriage. Understanding how education is affected by kidnapping risk allows us to better anticipate changes in education when the laws are enforced and the risk declines. We develop a two-period utility model to highlight the effects of kidnapping risk on education and to help identify those girls who are most likely to increase their education when faced with positive regional kidnapping risk and thus most likely to reduce education if the risk is eliminated. We test the implications of the theory empirically using the Life in Kyrgyzstan data. Difference-in-difference regression results point to a negative relationship between regional kidnapping rates and education, suggesting that the elimination of kidnapping is likely to induce higher education rates of women in Kyrgyzstan. The results are informative to the literature at the intersection of marriage traditions, women's bargaining power and education attainment.","Marriage institutions and laws are increasingly recognized as having substantial effects on the schooling decisions of girls and young women in developing and transitional economies. The returns to education depend not only on potential wage gains but also on marriage transitions and marriage quality. Marriage institutions, in turn, vary across regions and ethnic groups for complex reasons, often due to quirks of history. Recent work along these lines suggests that the degree to which a country's marriage institutions favor men (e.g. patrilocality, concern for girl's “purity”), helps explain low female labor force participation, unequal decision making power within households, reduced investment in female human capital, and higher tolerance for gender-based violence (Bannerjee et al., 2013). Numerous studies highlight the effects of specific marriage institutions on women's outcomes, for example, child marriage (Wodon et al., 2017; World Health Organization, 2016; Sekhri and Debnath, 2014; Field and Ambrus, 2008), polygyny (Schoellman and Tertilt, 2006; Tertilt, 2006, 2005), son preference (Edlund, 1999; Foster and Rosenzweig, 2001), arranged marriages (Edlund and Lagerlöf, 2006; Vogl, 2013), bride price and dowries (Anderson, 2007; Ashraf et al., 2020), patrilocality (Levine and Kevane, 2003), and bride exchange (Jacoby and Mansuri, 2010).====In this paper, we focus on the relationship between education of young women and a particular marriage institution in Kyrgyzstan, bride kidnapping. Marriages that begin with the abduction of a woman are called ==== in Kyrgyz, which translates as “====” and are still common amongst ethnic Kyrgyz. Approximately 20 percent of all current marriages in the country originated through the cultural practice of bride kidnapping (National Statistical Committee, 2016). Although the practice is illegal, enforcement is weak as many believe the practice to be an expression of traditional culture.====We argue that ==== the direction of the effect of kidnapping risk on girls’ education is ambiguous, as there are two competing effects. First, investment in education is, like all investment, a risky venture – i.e. returns to education are variable and accrue in the future while the costs of education are immediate.==== When there is a risk of kidnapping, and those who are abducted into marriage are not expected to accrue the full rewards of their education, investment in education will be reduced. We refer to this negative relationship between the risk of kidnapping and education as the Consumption Decline Effect (CDE). Alternatively, young women may be more likely to enroll in higher education to reduce their individual probability of being kidnapped. Education may reduce the probability of kidnapping through a number of channels: (1) women are less likely to be abducted while they are in school, (2) young women may migrate away from rural regions to urban centres (where kidnapping is rare) to attend universities, (3) while in higher education, women may find a love match and thus avoid kidnapping, and (4) the completion of higher education may signal her modernization to potential kidnappers. We refer to this positive relationship between the risk of kidnapping and education as the Kidnapping Probability Effect (KPE). In general, the effect of kidnapping risk on education investment of women will be negative when the CDE dominates, and positive when the KPE dominates.====As noted, our research complements and builds on a broad literature linking cultural marriage practices and investment in daughters. This growing body of literature models a number of relationships: the effect of economic conditions on marriage traditions (Corno and Voena, 2016; Corno et al., 2020; Mbaye and Wagner, 2017; Anderson, 2003), the effect of education on marital customs (André et al., 2017), and effect of marital customs on education (see above). Within the latter group, the literature can be further segmented. The first group of papers considers the direct effects of participating in a particular marriage institution on women's outcomes. Examples include Jacoby and Mansuri (2010), who show that Pakistani women in exchange marriages (==== marriages) have a lower probability of marital disruption, depressive episodes, and domestic abuse, and Field and Ambrus (2008), who use the age of menarche as an instrumental variable for child marriage and calculate that, in rural Bangladesh, a delay of marriage of one year leads to an increase of 0.2 years of schooling.====The second group of papers analyzes the indirect effects of the mere existence of the marriage institution on women's outcomes. Edlund and Lagerlof (2006), construct an overlapping generations model to demonstrate that a shift from parental consent (arranged marriages) to individual consent (love marriages) redistributes resources from old to young and from men to women. Levine and Kevane (2003) consider the marital tradition of virilocality (daughter moves away after marriage) and find no support for the hypothesis that the practise reduces investment in daughters in Indonesia. Ashraf et al. (2020) estimate the effect of the custom of bride price in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia on the education of girls. The positive relationship between bride price received and daughter's education raises the returns to education above what a standard wage model would suggest. The authors show that families in ethnic groups who practise bride price are more likely to take advantage of increased education opportunities, relative to those who do not engage in the practice of bride price. Motivated by the results of Ashraf et al. (2020), our paper considers the effect of bride kidnapping risk on the education of girls in Kyrgyzstan, and whether the elimination of this institution may have the unintended consequence of reducing the education of girls.====We develop a simple two-period expected utility model to highlight the channels through which kidnapping risk affects education investment.==== We expect that the response to kidnapping risk varies with the level of tradition in households and regions. Households may be traditional and embrace the practice of bride kidnapping, or non-traditional and oppose the practice. Regions may also be traditional or non-traditional. We assume that the reputation cost imposed on girls who reject kidnappings impacts their ability to make a quality marriage match following the kidnapping rejection and that this reputation cost is higher in traditional regions than non-traditional regions. A positive relationship between education and bride kidnapping risk is shown to be most likely for (i) women in traditional regions, (ii) women in households that are not strongly traditional nor strongly non-traditional, and (iii) women in non-complementary situations – i.e. women in traditional households in non-traditional regions, and women in non-traditional households in traditional regions.====We test the implications of the model using data from the Life in Kyrgyzstan (LiK) survey. The risk of being kidnapped varies across regions within the country and is practiced only by the Kyrgyz ethnicity, not other ethnicities in Kyrgyzstan, such as Tajiks and Uzbeks (Sharshenova, 2011; Amsler and Kleinbach, 1999).==== These regional and cultural variations allow us to identify the effect of kidnapping risk by estimating a difference-in-difference model. We first estimate the effect of regional kidnapping risk on the education of young Kyrgyz women, relative to women in Kyrgyzstan who are ethnic Uzbeks. We then estimate the effect of kidnapping risk on the education of young Kyrgyz women in traditional households relative to those in non-traditional households.====Our empirical results suggest that for the entire Kyrgyz population, the effect of kidnapping risk on education is negative (the CDE dominates). Within the Kyrgyz community, we find that the estimated effect of kidnapping risk on education differs little for traditional and non-traditional households. The results suggest that an institutional change that reduces or eliminates bride kidnapping will not have an adverse effect on the education of women in Kyrgyzstan and may indeed lead to an increase in education enrollment and levels.====The paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2 we provide more information about the practice of bride kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan.

Their share of total credits in China was 12 percent in 2009, grew to 20 percent by 2014, and stayed around 20 percent until 2018 when a tightening of regulations on shadow banking by the central government reduced it to 15 percent. The rapid rise of shadow banking activities since 2009 has attracted a great deal of attention in both policy circles==== and academia.==== Is shadow banking a new phenomenon in China? What are the driving forces behind China's shadow banking activities? Most important, how does shadow banking affect China's real economy? These are the questions that I address in this paper.====I argue that shadow banking is not a new phenomenon; it has always been a part of China's financial system since the 1980s, and arose from the need to get around various lending restrictions imposed by the central government on banks. I also emphasize two potential effects of shadow banking on China's real economy. On one hand, because many productive private firms face difficulties in getting access to formal bank credits, lending through shadow banking activities may help to ease these firms’ credit constraints and therefore efficiency enhancing. On the other hand, shadow banking activities can also be used by local governments and SOEs to finance their favored but less efficient projects and therefore contribute to misallocation of capital. I provide evidence suggesting that the shadow banking activities initiated by banks prior to 1996 were efficiency enhancing. In recent years, however, I find that the shadow banking loans have a positive effect on real estate investments only, and their effects on investments by private firms outside the real estate sector have been negative. This suggests that the recent shadow banking activities may have diverted credits away from productive but credit-constrained private firms outside the real estate sector and contributed to the worsening of capital allocation in China.",The varying shadow of China's banking system,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718306048,23 July 2020,2020,Research Article,147.0

We build a model studying motivations for and effects of ownership-restricting policies. When some agents are prohibited from purchasing housing, competitive equilibrium further punishes renters, failing to attain a “second-best” that maximizes welfare subject to the policy’s intended constraint. We then consider real estate taxation, a hotly debated topic in China, currently undergoing reform. We show that positive ==== on housing transactions can help mitigate the inefficiency caused by restricted ownership, but only by introducing a new distortion. Meanwhile, subsidizing rental transactions could, in theory, restore the second-best, but only by diverting public funds away from other uses.","China’s “great migration” has led the Middle Kingdom’s urban population to grow by half a billion people over the past few decades. Indeed, the number of domestic migrants in China exceeds the estimated 232 million international migrants throughout the rest of the world (Gardner, 2014). This mass rural-to-urban migration is often associated with China’s “economic miracle” that has taken place over the same period, lifting hundreds of millions out of extreme poverty. Although the flow of migrants to the largest cities has subsided, it has, nevertheless, given rise to significant divisions between longstanding residents and recent arrivals (Gregory and Meng, 2018).====One such division lies in the housing markets of at least 50 of China’s largest cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Ever since 2010, the governments of these cities have enacted policies restricting who can purchase real estate. More specifically, the Chinese ====,==== or household registration system assigns each citizen to a specific geographic area. As the aforementioned migration numbers suggest, enforcement that people physically remain in their assigned areas is extremely lax. However, under these policies, the ==== system significantly affects people’s ability to buy real estate. So, for instance, holders of Beijing ====, often those who were born in that city, are entitled to purchase one unit of housing (of any particular size/value) to live in, as well as an extra unit that may be used to rent out. On the other hand, people living in Beijing without a local ==== cannot purchase any real estate until they can prove that they have paid local taxes for multiple years.====When they are spoken about in the press, the motivation typically given for such policies is to “curb prices” in a hot market.==== However, aside from their possible effects on the overall trajectory of housing prices, a number of separate, more microeconomic questions arise regarding the motivation for and the effects of housing ownership restrictions. What kinds of allocative inefficiencies do such restrictions lead to? Whom do they benefit and whom do they harm? Moreover, Chinese officials have actively discussed reforming the ways in which real estate is taxed (see below). Does conventional wisdom regarding different forms of real estate taxation apply in an environment in which ownership restrictions are in place? Finally, in seeking to make the housing market function more smoothly, which kinds of frictions should one target?====The simple, static,==== general equilibrium model we develop to shed light on these issues raises three main points: first, a basic economic mechanism resulting from restricted ownership drives an ====. Second, due to a key difference between frictions incurred by landlords and tenants, policies designed to lesson the former may be relatively more promising in this context. Third, in such an environment, transaction taxes discouraging sale or favoring rental can be corrective, but each with its own costs.====In the model, if offered the choice between purchasing and renting housing at equivalent prices, agents would (at least weakly) prefer to purchase. Meanwhile, owners of units who do not wish to occupy them prefer to sell for given price, rather than manage them as rental properties while receiving an equal stream of rental revenue. Thus, the rental market, which would otherwise be inactive, springs up as a result of the government policy restricting some agents from owning housing.====The most straightforward effect of the ownership restriction policy is that it harms non-==== holders, who are forced to rent rather than own the homes they occupy. Moreover, the policy has a split impact on those who are authorized to own real estate. On the one hand, it helps those who, under the ====, do not own housing by allowing them to acquire it more cheaply. On the other hand, for those who already own housing, it diminishes the demand for their surplus units, thus lowering the value of their endowments.====More subtly, when the government restricts some agents from owning real estate, competitive equilibrium is no longer efficient, even in the “Second-Best” sense of Lipsey and Lancaster (1956). In other words, keeping in place the constraint that non-==== holders must rent the housing in which they live, the prices that arise at equilibrium do not maximize total surplus. This inefficiency stems from the fact that, for owners of excess housing (beyond what they wish to occupy) to be willing to put their property on the rental market, rather than to sell it, they must be compensated for the management frictions they will incur. However, such management frictions vary with the market value of the rental property. As a result, property owners who put their real estate on the rental market do not internalize the entire impact of this action. This leads to overconsumption of housing by those who are authorized to own it, and underconsumption by those who must rent.====Together, these findings call to attention to an interesting tradeoff underlying ownership restriction policies that seems orthogonal to the aforementioned, widely cited objective of maintaining price stability in the housing market. In particular, the market’s failure to attain the Second-Best suggests that a city government that chooses to implement such restrictions does so, in part, to favor the interests of the relatively less-well-off natives over both wealthier natives and (often poorer) recent arrivals, at the expense of allocative efficiency.====The allocative inefficiency that arises when ownership restrictions are in place raises a host of questions about the merits of different forms of taxation in such an environment. An interesting feature of the Chinese housing market is that, in most locations, there is no property tax, although there have been rumblings that this may change.==== There are, however, transaction tax levied when property changes hands from one party to another and when it is rented out. Using our model, we analyze the impact of both property taxes and taxes on sales and rental transactions.====In line with a standard result discussed by Feldstein (1977), when the stock of housing is fixed, property taxation has no impact on the equilibrium allocation of housing or on total surplus. Meanwhile, when the stock of housing is endogenous, property taxes lower the amount supplied at equilibrium, but they do not differentially affect the amount consumed by the various types of agents. Transaction taxes, on the other hand, give rise to much more novel analysis.====In particular, we show that imposing a small sales tax is always welfare-improving. This is because such a tax encourages rental. Thus, it reduces the gap, which, at equilibrium, is inefficiently large, between the aggregate amount of housing consumed by ====-holding (“insider”) owners and non-====-holding (“outsider”) renters. However, the introduction of a sales tax also brings about a separate distortion within the group of insiders. Specifically, it discourages the insiders who initially hold a large endowment of housing from selling a sufficiently large fraction of these holdings to other, less well-endowed insiders. Consequently, the optimal sales tax is positive; it solves the tradeoff brought about by these two distortions but fails to restore the Second-Best outcome.====Unlike a sales tax, a rental tax does not introduce such a wedge between the consumption levels of the endowed and unendowed insiders. Consequently, it can restore the Second-Best. However, in order to do so, it must be negative; i.e., it must be a subsidy. This is because, in its absence, the equilibrium amount of rental is inefficiently low. Thus, although such an instrument is appealing from a theoretical perspective. In our context, however, it could be practically unappealing, as it involves using public funds to directly favor well-endowed ==== holders and non-==== holders, at the expense of less-wealthy ==== holders. As such, it would seem to visibly work against the interests of the group that the ownership restriction policy, itself, is intended to favor. In addition, rental subsidies would create incentives to game the system for the sole purpose of receiving the subsidy. Currently, Beijing and other Chinese cities imposes positive transaction taxes on both sales and rental transactions.====In sum, our model====These results can help to inform, in particular, two areas of housing policy in China. First, they are relevant for ongoing discussions about how to improve the real estate rental market. An especially relevant example of such efforts is the December 2017 conference, held by the Chinese State Council, which advocated for mechanisms to promote rental efficiency. One proposal that emerged was for the establishment of better platforms to intermediate landlord-tenant matching, to better deal with conflicts between landlords and tenants, and to improve tenants’ rights (Xinhua, 2017b).====Our model shows that, so long as restricted ownership is in place, it is particularly important to focus on alleviating frictions that are proportional to the total ====, rather than volume, of rental inventory on the market. Whereas both landlords and tenants likely incur costs that are proportional to volume (e.g, matching, transferring/receiving rent, etc.), landlords are more likely to also incur frictions proportional to property value, as the potential for loss due to damage scales in this dimension. Thus, even if tenants are the intended beneficiaries of the aforementioned efforts to improve rental, it may be worthwhile to focus attention on measures that, at a superficial level, appear to be more helpful to landlords, in order to increase supply of rental units.====Second, standard thinking about the merits of different forms of real estate taxation should be adapted to take into account the effects of restricted ownership. Following the pilot property tax programs, mentioned above, in Shanghai and Chongqing, there have been growing calls for broader adoption of ownership-based taxation. In addition to the comments of Premier Li, cited in footnote,==== officials from the tax authority have claimed that real estate taxation is more effective when it is ownership-based rather than the current, transaction-based practice (Xiao, 2017). Others have said that the two forms complement each other (Reuters, 2010).====Our results appear incompatible with the former of these two views. Under the restricted ownership policy, even without any taxes, the economy fails to obtain the Second-Best. Thus, the conventional argument for avoiding transaction-based taxes, because they more directly distort incentives,==== does not necessarily apply. Instead, we find that properly chosen transaction taxes improve incentives. The latter view, advocating complementarity between property and transaction taxes is more compatible with our findings. In particular, we find that rental subsidies have the potential to restore the Second-Best, but they draw on public funds. These could, in theory, be raised via a property tax in a non-distortionary way. However, as we discuss in Subsection 5.3, where we extend the model from its simple, quasi-linear baseline to a version that allows for wealth effects, there are two caveats. First, we believe a good degree of caution is warranted before adopting such fiscal policy as a corrective to the effect of the initial, ownership restriction policy. Second, the relative merits of transaction-based taxes and subsidies depend on one’s view of the more general macroeconomic effects of government spending, itself a topic of debate.====The stylized model that we develop in this paper to study certain facets of the Chinese housing market contrasts with most literature on the topic; most work in this area covers more “macro” aspects (e.g., Fang et al. (2016), Glaeser et al. (2017), Han et al. (2018)), especially the evolution of housing price levels over time, relative to other assets. Nevertheless, a recent stream of empirical papers focuses particularly on the effect of ownership restriction policies. This includes Wu et al. (2012), which points out China’s high sale-to-rental price ratios in the period before the adoption of ownership restriction policies and Sun et al. (2017), showing a drop in sales prices and sales-to-price ratios once the policies took effect. Cao et al. (2015) and Du and Zhang (2015) also find the policies to be effective in curbing housing prices; Cao et al. (2018) find that such policies discourage demand for investment in housing.==== Li et al. (2017) and Chen et al. (2018) both use simulation techniques to predict the future dynamics of housing prices in the Chinese setting with restricted ownership.====Literature on real estate taxation in China includes Bai et al. (2014), Cao and Hu (2016), and Du and Zhang (2015). These articles do not, however, observe variation in transaction tax policies and thus do not have direct bearing on the primary focus of Section 4 in our paper. The aspects of the housing market that we study are motivated, broadly speaking, by China’s urban-versus-rural divisions. Meng and Zhang (2001) is a pioneering work on this topic, Song et al. (2012) models Chinese urbanization, and Gregory and Meng (2018) provides a recent update on the topic.====Using a stylized model to study specific public policy questions in an urban context follows in the spirit of works such as Chen and West (2000) and Ushchev et al. (2015). Given our aim of cleanly shedding light on a set of potentially complicated economic mechanisms, we intentionally ignore many of the myriad factors that also influence housing markets, especially in the baseline model described in Section 2. A vast literature addresses different topics that could potentially interact with the issues we address in interesting ways. This includes, especially, work comparing ownership and rental of real estate (see, e.g., Smith (1974); Rosen and Smith (1983); Weiss (1978); Henderson and Ioannides (1983); Flavin and Yamashita (2002); Himmelberg et al. (2005).==== The aim of this literature differs from ours in that it seeks to explain different individuals choices to own or rent housing, whereas we take as given a general preference to own, which has been documented in China (Wei, Zhang, 2011, Hu, 2013) and study the effects of forced rental. Finally, our work builds on classic studies of property and commodity taxation (e.g., Feldstein (1977), Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976), etc.)","Outsiders, insiders and interventions in the housing market",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718306176,22 July 2020,2020,Research Article,148.0

Using annual data for 106 countries over the period 1975-2015 and a two-step system GMM estimator, this study shows that right-wing governments are indeed more prone to promote economic freedom and to deregulate the economy. It also finds that this effect seems to be stronger in developing/emerging economies than in more developed countries. Moreover, the analysis of the broad dimensions of economic freedom indicates that right-wing governments tend to act by improving monetary soundness and freedom to trade internationally and by easing regulations that restrict entry into markets. Mainstream left-wing governments do not seem to affect economic freedom, however populist left-wing parties, when in office, are found to have a detrimental effect.","There is a common believe that ideologies shape policy debates and choices. A fundamental premise for this is that right-wing parties defend a decentralized economy funded on economic freedom and on the protection of property rights, while left-wing parties tend to the diverge from this scenario. This gave rise to an abundancy of studies analyzing partisan preferences over macroeconomic variables with some degree of success in capturing distinctions between right and left ruling (see, for instance, Alesina et al., 1997; Franzese, 2002). However, hovering above the realm of the macroeconomy, we come across the notion of economic freedom that, in general, stands for the degree to which an economy is a market economy. This landscape in which economic agents operate is shaped by policy decisions and existing institutions.====In today's democracies, political debates and voters’ perceptions align significantly with the idea that selecting between right or left governments is a choice between socialism and unrestrained free markets. The idea of partisan preferences over economic freedom has been consolidated by, for example, Margaret Thatcher's and Ronald Reagan's strong support to the concept of free markets. In a more recent case, the expansion in the size and scope of the government under the Obama administration – which included new regulations in areas like finance, health care, and the environment – pushed the United States to its lowest economic freedom score ever in 2017. However, under the Trump administration, America's economic freedom has seen a substantial boost linked to several policy changes that include tax cuts and deregulation. Nevertheless, there are also historical examples that contradict the traditional left-right positioning over market freedom. For instance, Tony Blair's “New Labour” (1997-2007) defended limitations to government involvement in the markets and was open to the idea that the state should not own major industries. Yet the empirical question remains: Do right-wing parties, when in office, actually promote and guarantee economic freedom, while left-wing governments are more moderate on this matter? And if so, in which of the major dimensions of economic freedom is ideology relevant? These are important questions, not only from the perspective of the democratic functioning of societies, but also for those studying policy decision making. Additionally, answering these questions is critical for understanding the actual contribution of modern political parties to the organization of contemporary societies, allowing us to assess if the longstanding theoretical debate between free markets and interventionism is indeed reflected in real policy choices.====The main goal of this paper is to provide an empirical answer to these interesting research questions. Some clues can be found in the existing literature, but the number of papers on the subject is scarce and centered at the sub‐national level. The present paper goes beyond the strict examination of developed economies and resorts to an extended timeframe of annual data in the empirical analysis. To accomplish the task at hand, annual data are collected for 106 countries over the period 1975-2015 and adequate panel data techniques are used to assess the role of ideology. In addition, it tests other political and economic features such as the relevance of time in office, majority governments and the impact of financial crisis. As a measure for the many aspects of economic freedom, we rely on the aggregate Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) index computed by the Fraser Institute and on the five broad areas that compose it.====This study shows that left-wing governments do not affect economic freedom, unless they are populists. In that case, economic freedom is significantly undermined during their tenure in office. However, right-wing governments clearly conform to the expectations: they are indeed more prone to promote economic freedom and to deregulate the economy. This effect is found to be relatively stronger in their first term in office and in developing/emerging economies than in more developed countries. Furthermore, right-wing governments tend to stimulate economic freedom levels mainly through monetary soundness, international trade and by easing regulations that restrict entry into markets. In addition, other factors have also proved to play a relevant role in the economic freedom dynamics observed over the last decades.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the link between ideology and economic freedom; Section 3 describes the data, variables, and methodology. The empirical analysis and discussion of the results are presented in Section 4.

Yet our understanding of the influence that this engagement can have over elections is still rather limited. In this paper we study electoral consequences of citizens’ involvement in monitoring 2015 presidential elections in Poland. Our analysis provides strong support for arguments saying that watchdog organisations may have an important influence on electoral outcomes. Our findings suggest that in municipalities in which election observers were present the share of vote for an incumbent candidate, Bronisław Komorowski, was significantly lower than in municipalities where the watchdog organisation did not have its representatives. Our results are robust to several tests which allows us to argue that the effect we find should not be attributed to some unobservable factors.","Recent decades have witnessed growing concerns regarding electoral integrity (see e.g. Schedler, 2002; Birch, 2011 or Norris and Nai, 2017). In fact, many contentious elections end in disputes about alleged fraud, irregularities and malpractices. While the problem is often most acute in the third world and quasi-authoritarian regimes, in a less severe form it is also present in the long-established democracies (see e.g. Schaffer, 2008; Buckley, 2011; Hasen, 2012; Norris, 2015; Norris and Nai, 2017).====As commonly argued, flawed electoral competitions may undermine confidence in regime institutions, diminish trust towards politics and politicians, and thus pose a threat to democracy (Norris, 1999, Lehoucq, 2003). On the other hand though, electoral irregularities and malpractices can trigger civic activism that aims to protect and safeguard the integrity of the electoral process. As found in many studies, flawed elections often increase the participation of civil society in electoral processes (Norris, 2014, Norris, 2015). This seems to be especially the case for citizens who value free and fair elections and care about electoral legitimacy as they are more likely to engage in protest activism.====While this engagement may take many forms, one of them involves contributions to improving the quality of elections. Indeed, actions aimed at avoiding election fraud and revealing other flaws often originate in grassroots movement of domestic observers. As the ACE project informs, the observation of electoral processes by national citizen groups has evolved significantly in the first years of XXI==== century (Nagore and Tuccinardi, 2015). The surge of these initiatives reflects a common belief that election observation can considerably hinder vote manipulation by detecting or deterring electoral fraud (Hyde, 2008, Norris, Nai, 2017). This is based on the assumption that people who wish to commit fraud would not do it in the presence of observers. In line with this view, the effect of observers on electoral fraud is often concluded from the comparison of electoral outcomes in the commissions that are monitored and those that are not. More specifically, the effect should be reflected in systematically different electoral outcomes in the two types of commissions. Instead if the observers have no impact, it is expected that in observed and unobserved commissions the candidates (and the incumbent candidate in particular) should perform equally well.====That being said, there is an ongoing debate whether election observers can have a substantial effect on reducing electoral fraud (see, for example, Enikolopov et al., 2013 and Buzin et al., 2016 for a discussion about the impact of observers in Russia). In addition, it has been argued that documenting the effect of observers on electoral outcomes should not be automatically equated with the evidence for electoral fraud (Hyde and Kelley, 2011). Furthermore, the available evidence is still rather limited. In this paper we aim at further contributing to this literature. In order to achieve that, we study the political consequences of citizen’s mobilisation to monitor elections in Poland. More specifically, we look at the effect of citizens’ engagement with monitoring the May 2015 presidential elections, following flaws observed in the November 2014 local elections. The civic activism was driven by the dissatisfaction with how the authorities (the National Electoral Commission, governing coalition and the incumbent president Bronisław Komorowski) responded to accusations of electoral fraud and controversies about the accuracy of the 2014 election results. The concerns about the integrity of the electoral process fuelled fears that the ruling Civic Platform party might resort to electoral fraud during the 2015 presidential elections in order to secure Bronisław Komorowski his second term in office. The fears of potential electoral malpractices together with the willingness to assure electoral integrity led to the emergence of citizens’ movement that aimed at monitoring the 2015 elections.====In this paper we investigate whether the civic engagement affected the electoral outcomes and in particular what impact it had on the electoral results of the incumbent president. To do so, we look at two presidential elections, held in 2010 and 2015 respectively. Since the monitoring of elections took place only in 2015 we use the differences-in-differences methodology and compare the change in the share of votes for the incumbent in the municipalities in which election observers appeared in 2015 to the change in support in the municipalities in which the elections were not monitored. Our results suggest that the presence of election observers negatively affected the share of vote of the incumbent candidate and that this effect is statistically significant and robust to several tests. These findings provide strong support for the role that grassroots citizen groups may play in shaping electoral results even in consolidated democracies. On the other hand, they also incline towards asking the questions about the quality of Polish elections and the potential channels through which the documented effect could have taken place. In this context it should be noted that controlling for confounding factors is difficult and therefore it is hard to pinpoint the exact mechanism leading to persistent effect of observers.====Our paper builds on and is related to several strands of the literature. First, we aim at contributing to the literature on the effects of observers on political processes and election outcomes (Hyde, 2007, Kelley, 2012, Hyde, Marinov, 2014). As these papers convincingly argued, the presence of independent observers may improve the quality of the electoral process by deterring potential frauds and strengthening standards of election administration, and thus contribute to the development of democracy (Carothers, 1997).==== Our paper differs from these studies in two main respects. First, the existing evidence comes predominantly from developing countries and concerns mainly newly emerged democracies or quasi-authoritarian regimes. Second, the focus in the available studies is often on the role of international observers. Instead, our analysis reports the evidence on Poland, i.e. a country which is commonly perceived as a consolidated democracy and free.==== Poland is also highly rated in overall levels of electoral integrity (Norris et al., 2016).==== Further, our focus is on the importance of grassroots movement of domestic observers.====By examining the role of civil society in electoral processes, the present paper contributes to the growing literature which acknowledges the impact that domestic election observer groups may have for deterring frauds, ensuring transparency and increasing credibility of elections (see, for example, Bjornlund, 2004; López-Pintor, 2010; GCEDS, 2012; GNDEM, 2012; Ichino and Schündeln, 2012; Enikolopov et al., 2013; Buzin et al., 2016; Asunka et al., 2019). This literature is predominantly based either on an anecdotal evidence or on experimental design. Our empirical approach takes a different direction and uses a differences-in-differences methodology. More specifically, we exploit the fact that an incumbent candidate takes part in two consecutive elections and that each of the elections consists of two rounds of voting. This allows us to control for a number of unobservable factors that are likely to affect political preferences of the voters as well as for the fact that these preferences may change over time. Thanks to this, we can remove the impact of potentially confounding factors that might have impacted both the propensity to organise the monitoring and the election outcomes. To best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to use this approach in studying observers’ influence over elections. Since the situation in which the incumbent candidate needs to take part in two ballots is not that rare, the method we propose can be applied also in other geographical contexts. This strategy seems to be particularly attractive for those settings in which, for various reasons, the experimental design was not implemented. Our data have also additional advantage. Typically, only a small fraction of polling stations is visited by election observers (see e.g. Hyde and Kelley, 2011). Alternatively, the focus in the experimental design is often on covering a specific region/type of constituencies (e.g. a capital or larger cities). This raises the question whether the results from studies using these strategies can be generalised to a national context. In our case instead, the civic engagement with monitoring elections was organised on a national scale. What follows is that in our analysis we can use the data from the whole country and take advantage of the fact that election observers gathered information on more than 25% of the territory. We are not aware of any other paper investigating the effects of observers with such a broad coverage.==== This issue is of importance as political parties may strategically respond to civil society’s efforts to detect electoral irregularities and concentrate their activities in regions/polling stations that are unobserved (Ichino and Schündeln, 2012). This obviously is more likely if the observers cover only a small fraction of the territory.====The civic engagement under study would not be possible without social mobilisation (Rogers et al., 2018). Indeed, monitoring elections can make sense only when many people perform the behaviour. From this perspective, our study is also related to the literature on the political consequences of social movements (see e.g. Tarrow, 1994; Andrews, 1997; Giugni, 1998; Amenta and Caren, 2004; Amenta et al., 2010). These studies provide convincing support for arguing that social mobilisation may have an important effect for the outcomes of various political processes, including elections. To best of our knowledge though, this literature is predominantly concerned with the influence of social movements exerted through channels different than monitoring electoral processes (for an excellent review of this literature see, for example, Amenta et al. (2010)).====Finally our work is also related to studies analysing the effect of political protests on political outcomes (Madestam, Shoag, Veuger, Yanagizawa-Drott, 2013, Aidt, Franck, 2015, Acemoglu, Hassan, Tahoun, 2017). While the citizen’s engagement with monitoring elections that we study was, in principle, non-partisan, it was dominated by people dissatisfied with the way the then Polish government worked.

In sharp contrast to Mao's aggressive extractive policy against the peasantry, the 181 Central Committee (CC) members—the political elite of the Chinese Communist Party—may have alleviated the casualty of this most devastating famine, by arranging more “resale grain” to be shipped to their hometowns. Specifically, having an additional native CC member in a prefecture reduces the excess death of that prefecture by 46,500, accounting for 2.3 percentage points in the death rate when evaluated at the mean. The effect is more pronounced if a CC member worked in the central planning apparatus in charge of grain transfer. Moreover, evidence suggests that the counties with more CC members tended to receive more resale grain, while grain procurement remained affected.","It was not until recently that “birthplace” or “hometown”, as an analytical concept, began receiving serious attention in the political economic analysis of development. For instance, rich evidence has been amassed showing that many dictators around the world have poured disproportionate amounts of resources into their hometowns, in some instances favoring their own ethnic groups, irrespective of what the economic returns were (e.g., Burgess et al., 2015; Franck and Rainer, 2012; Kramon and Posner, 2016). But self-interest is not always the only motivation for hometown or regional favoritism. Using authoritarian Vietnam as an example, Do et al. (2017) find that, upon coming into power public officials in Vietnam allocated more public resources to their hometowns. In this study, we use China's Great Leap Famine (1959-61) to illustrate the role of political elites in shaping its outcome;==== an effect that arose also out of the presumed compassion of high-level officials for those with whom they share a geographic affinity.====We choose China's Great Leap Famine for examining the potential hometown effects of the political elites not only because it is the “worst famine in human history”, but also, given the highly centralized nature of China's authoritarian regime these leaders likely played a pivotal role in resource allocation, and yet only scant attention has been paid to studying the potential influence of key political leaders.==== Yet, anecdotal evidence suggests that political leaders not directly involved in the governance of the provinces may have attempted to save the lives of those sharing their hometown affiliations. For instance, Xi Zhongxun (the father of China's current Party chief Xi Jinping), a native of Shaanxi Province, had allegedly asked the Shaanxi provincial government to “allocate relief grain” to his hometown Fuping County (Lin, 2008). This paper attempts to systematically examine whether political elites ever practiced such favoritism, and if so whether the practice played a role in reducing famine severity in their hometowns.====We choose CC-CCP members as the potential actors for examining the human factor in shaping the famine's outcome because the CC is the supreme ruling nucleus of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) (Lieberthal, 1995), and as such its members were likely the ones who played a key role in reallocating the relief grain.==== To examine the association between CC-CCP membership and famine severity in their hometowns, we construct a data set covering 265 prefectures across 18 Chinese provinces.==== We choose the prefecture over the province to be our unit of analysis mainly because of the enormous variation in the death rates even within a province, not to mention that the Chinese province would be geographically too large for identifying hometown effects. Given that our period of interest is 1959-1961, we focus exclusively on the membership of the Eighth CC, which was first elected in 1956 and later amended in 1958.==== Out of the 195 members elected, 181 (nearly 93 percent) are included in our sample. Our data set thus consists of 181 CC members in 265 sample prefectures. Our key explanatory variable is the number of CC members in a prefecture.====Our first key finding is that having an additional native member in the CC significantly reduces a prefecture's excess death rate by 43.5 percent when evaluated at the mean (the average excess death rate is 107 per thousand), which equates to as many as 46,500 lives saved. But the effect of CC membership on reducing famine severity is heterogeneous, patterned upon whether a CC member worked in the central or local (provincial) government. The strongest effect, our analysis finds, comes from those who worked in the central planning department, and specifically with duties related to the procurement and resale of grain. This nuanced finding reinforces the anecdotal evidence from Xi Zhongxun (a central government official) that hometown favoritism was initiated by, and effectuated through, political elites not directly involved in governing the provinces, the latter of whom had very different career incentives as others have found (Kung and Chen, 2011). Second, and by recognizing the importance of central planning, we are able to rule out the concern that favoritism was born out of “factional ties”, as many of the CC members who worked in central planning were intimately tied to such political elites as Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. In fact, we find quite the contrary. As it turned out, the CC members who had close ties with Liu and Deng had significantly higher excess deaths in the prefectures where they originally came from. We conjecture that both Liu and Deng were deeply aware of how unrealistic Mao's ambitions were for the Leap, yet they also knew that any favoritism extended by their subordinates to their hometowns would easily invite political backlash and is thus an outcome these leaders were eager to avoid.====Although the geographic distribution of the CC members might be endogenous, the determinants of the number of CC members are more likely to be orthogonal to famine severity since most of the CC members had left their hometown at a very young age, and were promoted into the CC when they were serving elsewhere (as regulations prohibited them from working in their hometowns). To further ensure that endogeneity is not a major concern, we conduct three additional tests. First, given that those who came from the “revolutionary bases” stood a higher chance of becoming a CC member, we perform a test and are able to rule out the concern that the revolutionary bases may also be a significant determinant of excess death rate. Second, we follow the procedure developed by Oster (2019) in assessing the extent to which our estimation is affected by biases of an omitted variable nature. Given that the lower bound of the CC member's effect is much larger than zero in our analysis, the likelihood that our estimated effect is fully driven by the unobserved factors is small according to Oster's model. Third, we perform a placebo test to examine whether the CC membership of the Seventh (in 1945), Eighth (in 1956), and Ninth (in 1969) National Congresses may also have a significant effect on reducing the famine's severity, and find that only the Eighth National Congress has had a negative and statistically significant effect on the outcome variable of interest, while the other two congresses do not.====Our last contribution lies in providing suggestive evidence regarding the possible channels through which the CC members were able to offer their “distant relatives” more food for their own consumption—the primary reason for a lower excess death rate. We focus on two possible mechanisms related to the grain distribution system—the procurement and resale of grain. The first plausible channel is that the central government may reduce the amount of grain that farmers were required to procure and submit to the state. Alternatively, the provincial government may ship more “resale grain” (====) to the hometown prefectures of the CC-CCP members for famine relief, as Xi Zhongxun's famous request amply demonstrates. Based on the analysis of 109 counties in Henan Province—a famine-stricken province for which county-level data are available, we find that CC membership has no significant effect on grain procurement but a significant and positive effect on grain resale; the net effect is a significant reduction in ==== grain procurement (gross procurement minus resale). What we have found is thus consistent with the observation that grain procurement was most likely “institutionally rigid” (Meng, Qian, and Yared, 2015). But the system was not completely inflexible; once they had fulfilled the procurement obligations, provincial and lower level governments were allowed to redistribute relief grain to their jurisdictions (Li, 2011; Xu and Zhong, 2014).====Our work is clearly related to the importance of national leaders (e.g., Besley, Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, 2011; Jones and Olken, 2005). In the specific Chinese context, our work contributes to understanding the role that political leaders played in determining the severity of the world's most deadly famine under authoritarianism. In sharp contrast to the self-serving provincial officials—some of whom were prepared to sacrifice the lives of their people in pursuit of their own career interests, we show how other similarly high-ranking officials—especially those in charge of grain procurement and resale in the central planning department—had acted in the interest of their “distant relatives”. Our analysis reveals how the central planners, having been swept aside by Mao for the allegedly slow progress in China's economic development (Lieberthal and Lampton, 1992), might have leveraged what little power they had left and saved the lives of many of their “distant relatives” out of compassion at a tumultuous time when political uncertainty was high.====In addition, our work also contributes to the small literature on regional favoritism (e.g., Hodler and Raschky, 2014), a literature that has exposed many dictators around the world for pouring disproportionate amounts of resources into their hometowns favoring their own ethnic groups (e.g., Burgess et al., 2015; Franck and Rainer, 2012; Kramon and Posner, 2016). In this case, however, our work is more closely analogous to that of Do et al. (2017), who also found that hometowns were favored on compassionate grounds.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide a brief overview of both the literature on the Great Leap Famine during 1959-61 and the geographic distribution of the CC-CCP members of the Eighth National Congress. In Section 3 we test the hypothesis regarding the alleged effect of CC membership on famine severity and deal with the potentially endogenous nature of the explanatory variable by following a procedure designed to evaluate the extent to which an empirical analysis is driven by unobserved variables, and by conducting a test using alternative national congresses as placebos. Section 4 examines a number of CC membership's heterogeneous effects, including whether there may be spillover effects on neighboring prefectures, whereas in Section 5 we examine the two possible channels of hometown favoritism based on the analysis of 109 counties in Henan Province.

Building on a conceptual framework developed from standard theory and a detailed qualitative study of India's apparel industry, our econometric analysis exploits establishment-level data on formal Indian garment manufacturers between 2009-10 and 2013-14 and interstate variation in labor laws. We find a close fit between the implications of our conceptual framework, the qualitative evidence and the data. Apparel producers in states with pro-worker labor regulations tend to replace labor with capital. This choice of technique effect is smaller for exporting firms, which are more tightly bound to norms for organizing production in global supply chains. Pro-worker labor regulations also reduce output levels more for exporters than for non-exporters, consistent with exporters being bound to international pricing norms. Labor regulations thus have a particularly adverse impact on exporters. Our findings underscore the cost of poorly-designed and implemented labor regulations in a labor-abundant country wishing to spur exports, employment and industrial activity in labor-intensive ====.","Difficulties in achieving growth in exports and export-led employment are often attributed to pro-worker labor regulations, which, while potentially welfare-enhancing====, also carry unintended consequences (Economist, 2018, Nickell and Layard, 1999). While a large literature has examined a wide variety of effects of labor regulations====, their particular effects on exporting firms have not been examined before. This paper takes a first step towards filling this gap in the literature with a deep dive into India's formal garments sector – a labor-intensive industry with significant export potential, in a country with significant but geographically differentiated labor regulations.====The effects of labor regulations on the production decisions of surviving firms are complex, and often theoretically ambiguous. For example, pro-worker labor regulations could have both positive and negative effects on the employment levels of surviving firms: by making labor expensive relative to capital, they could induce firms to replace labor with machinery; by increasing marginal production costs, they could reduce firms’ optimal output and employment levels; and, conversely, they could drive less productive firms out of business, leaving only more productive firms, which tend to hire ==== workers. This complexity is compounded when thinking about whether and why the effects of labor regulations would be different between exporters and non-exporters. These differences could depend, inter alia, on differences between exporters and non-exporters in the elasticities of substitution between labor and capital, price elasticities of demand, and labor law's effects on fixed costs. A general conclusion, then, is that the effects of labor law could differ significantly across industries and target markets, depending upon technological, demand and competitive conditions. Interpretion of reduced-form tests of the effects of labor regulations and of their differential effects on exporters therefore requires a conceptual framework and some advance knowledge of market and technological conditions.====Our study contributes to the literature with a clear conceptual exposition of the main ways in which labor law could affect manufacturing firms, and of the reasons that their net effects might differ between exporting and non-exporting firms. We combine these conceptual insights with qualitative information gleaned from employers and industry experts in one industry – apparel manufacturing (Baruah, et al., 2015). With these priors in hand, our conceptual framework offers unambiguous predictions about the effects of labor regulations on some firm outcomes (specifically, capital intensity and labor productivity), and about the difference in these effects between exporters and non-exporters. The priors and framework together also permit us to interpret the multiple effects of labor regulations jointly to shed light on why they arise.====We then conduct an empirical analysis using detailed plant-level data between 2009-10 and 2013-14 to examine the impact of labor regulations on formal Indian apparel manufacturers producing for export and domestic markets. India is a useful case in which to study these issues. Labor regulations are constitutionally determined jointly by state and central governments. They can therefore vary widely across Indian states from pro-worker to pro-employer regimes –and in ways that allow the overall thrust of labor regulations to be captured quantitatively (see, in particular, Besley and Burgess, 2004, Dougherty, et al., 2011). On the other hand, trade and exchange rate policies, helpfully, do not vary across Indian states. To account for the endogeneity of labor regulations, we instrument for labor regulations with data on historical tax collection regimes from Banerjee and Iyer (2005).====We focus on the apparel industry for several reasons====. First, most policymakers and experts’ priors are that the effects of labor regulations should be most clearly felt in labor-intensive industries such as apparel. Indeed, as in many other developing countries, India's apparel industry is not only one of the largest employers in manufacturing, it is also the most labor-intensive subsector within manufacturing (Baruah, et al., 2015, Chaurey, 2015). Second, India's apparel sector has been a relative underperformer in export markets, with reason to believe that its labor regulations may be playing a significant role. For example, while China accounted for around 35% of global apparel exports from 2012-2015, India's share was around 4%, lower than those of Bangladesh and Vietnam (Government of India, 2017). India's formal sector apparel firms operate under a variety of labor regulations,==== some of which are potentially problematic for firms in an industry in which frequent changes in designs and a high degree of seasonality require firms to frequently adjust their workforce. Many observers therefore trace the relatively weak performance of the industry in export markets, and the large share of employment in the informal sector, in some part to labor regulations (see, for example, Ahluwalia, et al., 2018, Subramanian and Verma, 2016).====Consistent with our conceptual framework, we find that apparel producers in Indian states with pro-worker labor regulations tend to employ more capital-intensive techniques, produce more output per worker, and hire fewer workers. Inflexibility results in less capital-labor substitution among exporters than non-exporters, given that exporters, often functioning within global supply chains, have limited flexibility to choose production techniques. This constraint, highlighted by our qualitative analysis, means that pro-worker regulation is costlier to exporters than to non-exporters, and is also associated with relatively lower output per worker, output, capital and labor use among exporters relative to non-exporters.====We find that apparel firms in states with pro-worker labor regulations employ a larger share of contract workers. This is particularly so among domestic producers, as opposed to exporters for whom adherence to labor codes may be more relevant, given its significance for overseas buyers and consumers in advanced economies. Firms in states with pro-worker labor regulations also employ a smaller share of female workers directly. This is not surprising given that some regulations can make it more onerous to employ women. For example, the Factories Act restricts the use of women in night shifts out of concern for their safety. Finally, our results are also consistent with exporters facing stiffer price competition. They show that formal sector firms in states with pro-worker labor regulations are no less likely to export than their counterparts in other states, but that fewer and more positively selected firms survive in the formal sector (a near pre-requisite for exporting). Moreover, we find some evidence that among those firms that do export, those in states with pro-employer labor regulations export more. Our results are robust to employing an alternate measure of labor regulations; to the inclusion of state-specific time trends; to restricting the sample to firms that started operations after India's liberalization; and to dropping firms located in states with neutral (i.e. neither pro-employer nor pro-worker) labor regulations.====Our paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we discuss insights gleaned from practitioners and industry experts in interviews that guide our conceptual framework. Section 3 presents that framework. Section 4 explains our empirical strategy and Section 5 describes the data. We present results in Section 6.

A potential concern with such a segmented system is that the establishment of a non-employment-based insurance program may generate a disincentive for firms to provide health insurance benefits to workers. In this study, we empirically examine this crowd-out effect of a non-employment-based insurance program, the Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), in China. Exploiting city-by-year variations in the roll-out process of the program and utilizing a unique administrative dataset on Chinese firms, we find that the enactment of URBMI reduced a firm's offering of an employment-based health insurance program by a statistically significant 0.94-1.29 percentage point. This crowd-out effect was stronger among domestic private firms, new firms, and firms that are individual-owned.","In recent years, achieving universal health insurance coverage has been a top health policy priority in many countries and has been particularly challenging in developing countries (Bitran, 2014; Reich et al., 2016). Developing countries often face the challenge that a large share of the labor force lacks stable formal employment. As such, an employment-based health insurance system would fail to cover individuals without stable formal employment, who also tend to be financially vulnerable. To circumvent this challenge, many countries in the developing world have established a segmented health system, where different population groups defined based on income or employment status have access to different health insurance programs. In countries like China, Mexico, and Indonesia, formally employed workers obtained employment-based health insurance on a mandatory basis, which has a high premium and more generous benefits; individuals who are not formally employed obtain government-subsidized non-employment-based health insurance on a voluntary basis, which has a low premium and less generous benefits (Bitran, 2014; Blumenthal & Hsiao, 2015; Han, 2012; Sparrow, Suryahadi, & Widyanti, 2013).====Despite that these segmented systems serve the purpose of achieving universal or nearly universal coverage with limited resources, the efficiency of these systems merits further research. An important consideration is the potential issue of selection, which may result in a loss of economic efficiency. A segmented health insurance system is associated with at least three types of selection that need to be examined for policy evaluation. First, the voluntary nature of non-employment-based health insurance creates the classic adverse selection issue. If those who anticipate higher health expenditures select into coverage, the risk pooling design of health insurance will fall apart (Wang, Zhang, Yip, & Hsiao, 2006; Yao, Schmit, & Sydnor, 2017; Zhang & Wang, 2008). Second, the availability of non-employment-based programs may induce workers to exit formal employment (Azuara & Marinescu, 2013; Bosch & Campos-Vazquez, 2014). If the existence of a non-employment-based insurance program increases informality, which is often not subject to labor legislation or income taxation, it may lead to a loss of social efficiency. While these two types of individual selection are well-studied in the literature, there exists an often-neglected selection from the firm's perspective. In particular, with the existence of a non-employment-based program, firms may decide to evade offering health insurance by pushing workers to obtain coverage through the non-employment-based program. If firms have large bargaining power over workers in the labor market, workers may end up losing their employment-based health benefits. Similar to the adverse selection by individuals, such firm selection may weaken the risk pooling mechanism in the employment-based health insurance. If workers who would otherwise be covered by the employment-based program end up enrolling in the government-subsidized non-employment-based program, there will be a misuse of public funds. Therefore, a separate analysis should be conducted to understand the significance of firm selection. However, we are not aware of any existing study that examines insurance selection in developing countries by focusing on firm behavior.====In this study, we seek to fill the gap in the literature by providing an empirical examination of such firm selection in China. Specifically, we examine the effect of the Urban Residents Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), a non-employment-based insurance program, on firm's decision to offer the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), an employment-based insurance program. Although firms are required by law to provide UEBMI to workers, enforcement of such mandate is not perfect (Meng, 2006; Nyland, Smyth, & Zhu, 2006). As a result, the rate of UEBMI participation by firms is far from 100%. We test the hypothesis that the establishment of URBMI provides an opportunity for firms to push workers to enroll in URBMI, and thus not to offer UEBMI.====To establish a causal relationship, we exploit city-by-year variations in the enactment of URBMI. The program was piloted by the central government in 2007 and was gradually rolled out in all cities over several years. URBMI is a voluntary program and is government subsidized to combat potential adverse selection. We take advantage of a novel firm-level dataset: the National Tax Survey Database (NTSD) in 2007-2011. The data contain rich information about firm characteristics and a firm's contributions to UEBMI. We focus on a firm's participation in UEBMI, measured by making any contributions to the program. Using a difference-in-differences (DD) model and a propensity score matching difference-in-differences (PSM DD) model, we find robust evidence that the establishment of URBMI reduced a firm's offering of UEBMI by 0.94-1.29 percentage points (a 2.3%-3.2% decrease relative to a base offering rate of 40.3%). Subsample analyses suggest that the effect is pronounced among domestic private firms, new firms, and firms that are individual-owned. Moreover, the decrease in UEBMI offering is not accompanied by an increase in wage.====In addition to its contribution to the literature on the evaluation of segmented health insurance systems in developing countries, this study contributes to two other strands of literature. First, it enriches the literature on the evaluation of health insurance programs in China, particularly URBMI. Existing studies have examined the effects of URBMI on health care utilization and health (Liu & Zhao, 2014; Pan, Tian, Zhou, & Han, 2016; Qin, Pan, & Liu, 2014), labor supply of workers (Liu and Zhang 2018), and private insurance coverage (Liu, Gao, and Rizzo 2011; Hou and Zhang 2017). In addition, a few studies have found evidence for adverse selection due to the voluntary nature of the program (Chen & Yan, 2012; Wang et al., 2006). The current study, to our knowledge, is the first to examine the effect of URBMI on employment-based health insurance.====Second, this study contributes to an extensive literature on the crowd-out effect of government-subsidized insurance programs. Many studies have examined the negative effect of subsidized public insurance on employer-sponsored health insurance coverage in the US (for example, Cutler and Gruber 1996; Shore-Sheppard, Buchmueller, and Jensen 2000; Gruber and Simon 2008; Lo Sasso and Buchmueller 2004; Brown and Finkelstein 2008; Hamersma and Kim 2013). Despite ample evidence for crowd-out effect, little is known about whether the reduction in employer-sponsored health insurance coverage is driven by firms reducing provision or by workers reducing take up. There are only a few studies that we are aware of that seek to disentangle the mechanisms by directly looking at insurance provision by firms and have found small or no effect (Buchmueller, Cooper, Simon, & Vistnes, 2005; Shore-Sheppard et al., 2000). The current study contributes to the literature by providing a discussion of the firm response in the context of a developing country.",The effect of non-employment-based health insurance program on firm's offering of health insurance: Evidence from the social health insurance system in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718304979,24 June 2020,2020,Research Article,157.0

Consistent with ====. Interestingly, Chinese imports may distort the view of constituents toward China which render legislators in districts subject to large Chinese import competition to take an affirmative position on foreign policy that may hurt China.","One of the prominent features in current world economy is the peaceful rise of China as a major economic power in the recent past. For example, as seen in Figure 1, compared with the United States and Japan, China’s GDP as a share of world GDP has more than doubled over the past 26 years, from 6.8% in 1991 to 18.2% in 2017.==== Although there is no consensus==== on the root causes of this long-term sustainable growth, at face value, China’s growth is primarily inspired by its internal reforms, and Chinese product exports to developed countries play a monumental role. For example, China’s exports-to-GDP increased from 3.3% in 1991 to 18.7% in 2016. Among Chinese total exports, the share that went to Europe and the United States was 19.3% in 1991, and climbed to 34.6% in 2016. Various studies have shown the effects of the surge in Chinese import competition on U.S. society: deterioration of employment prospects of manufacturing workers (Autor et al., 2013; Pierce and Schott, 2016), health and mortality (McManus and Schaur, 2016; Pierce and Schott, 2020), and marriage market and fertility (Autor et al., 2019). These distributional effects of trade liberalization with China have been received much attention from U.S. legislators who are elected to be responsible for the welfare of their electorates and various concerns and thus legislation responses have been discussed and debated in the U.S. House: “China’s economic rise has significant implications for the United States and hence is of major interest to Congress.” (Morrison, 2015); “China’s economic rise has become a factor in congressional debate over various aspects of U.S. trade policy (that are not directly related to China), such as the renewal of trade promotion authority (TPA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).” (Morrison, 2015); “The push for PNTR was borne of wishful thinking rather than evidence or a genuine understanding of the Chinese Communist Party’s goals and objectives” (Legislator, Frank Wolf).====In this paper, we investigate whether the rise of Chinese imports in the United States will affect legislators’ voting decisions on fast-track authority (FTA), the most important power that the president needs to obtain from the Congress for signing free trade agreements with foreign countries. FTA==== is a temporary (usually five years) authority if the Congress decides to deliver it to the president. FTA empowers the president such that the Congress can only vote up or down on a free trade agreement the president has negotiated in a certain short period, and cannot make any amendments on the agreement. The testable hypothesis we propose is that legislators in districts that have been heavily affected by Chinese imports are less likely to vote in favor of FTA. This argument relies on the following two premises. First, to avoid endless amendments, foreign countries are reluctant to fix the contents in a trade agreement if the president has not yet obtained FTA; the president has the vision that free trade is in the country’s interest in the long run, and aims to maximize the welfare of the average district (Celik et al., 2015). Therefore, giving FTA to the president means paving the road for further liberalization. Second, recent trade liberalization has resulted in losers whose relative welfare compared with winners is more depressed, and there is no sign that there will be effective redistribution programs in the future (e.g., Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Pierce, Schott, 2016); district representatives care about the welfare of their electorate (Levitt, 1996, Mian, Sufi, Trebbi, 2010) and the representatives’ performance (improving the welfare of their constituency) in the district represents an important signal of their ability, which will be positively correlated with their later political career (e.g., senior position in the House and vice president).====Empirically, to quantify district exposure to Chinese import competition across years that have FTA bills (1992, 1996, 2000, 2014), we first obtain district-industry employment by using information on county-industry employment from the U.S. Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns (CBP) and population shares across district-county cells from the Missouri Census Data Center. Then we create district exposure to Chinese import competition by disaggregating the change in Chinese imports (UN Comtrade) in different districts, using district-industry shares as weights. A higher value of this index denotes larger exposure to Chinese import competition. To implement the idea, the dependent variable is a dummy that equals one if the incumbent legislator voted “Yea” or “Aye” on FTA and zero otherwise.====An obvious challenge in regressing the voting dummy on district exposure to Chinese import competition, along with a set of commonly accepted baseline controls, is that candidates who take a protective position may choose to run the campaign in districts with large import competition from low-income countries. In this case, we can only obtain a spurious estimate due to the reverse causality problem. Another caveat of ordinary least squares (OLS) analysis is that, since it is difficult to exhaust all the determinants, some district characteristics that attract certain candidates may also be correlated with industry structure or Chinese imports, generating omitted variable bias in our baseline estimate. To isolate the exogenous variation in district exposure to Chinese import competition, we construct an instrument relying on Chinese exports to eight other high-income countries in the same period and district industry structure as the previous one. The main reason for the selection of this instrument is that after 1992, the surge in Chinese manufacturing exports in high-income countries has been primarily caused by China’s internal institutional reform and thus productivity improvement and factor reallocation (i.e., migrants). Combining this Chinese supply shock in developed countries with lagged district-industry structure may generate a plausible source of exogenous variation in the variable of interest.====Our baseline IV Probit estimate suggests that district exposure to Chinese import competition has had a negative and significant effect on House members’ voting in favor of FTA. In particular, a one standard deviation increase in exposure to Chinese import competition causes the probability on voting in favor of the passage of FTA to decrease by 6.7 percentage point. This baseline result is robust to alternative dummy dependent variable models and alternative measures of our key independent variable. The assumption for instrument exogeneity is that conditional on the baseline covariates, our instrument should only affect legislators’ voting behavior through district exposure to Chinese import competition, other than its impact through the error term. The major concern with this exclusion restriction is that, during our sample period, the developed countries may have experienced a series of demand shocks on Chinese products, where district exposure to Chinese import competition may pick up their influences on legislators. To alleviate this concern, we control two major such demand shocks (i.e., housing boom and computerization) and our baseline estimate does not change qualitatively. To be cautious, we also conduct a falsification test, in which future change in district exposure to Chinese import competition should not affect past legislators’ voting behavior. The results are as expected.====Complementing extant studies, we show that in different regional units (county, district, and state), large exposure to Chinese import competition significantly causes a high unemployment rate and decreases income per capita; across different regional units, we also find that the regional growth rate decreases significantly because of regional exposure to Chinese import competition. These findings support the characterization that regional Chinese imports can be considered a “localized economic shock” (Feigenbaum and Hall, 2015). All these factors help to explain why legislators change their voting behavior on FTA because of the surge in Chinese imports. As an extension, we investigate the response of our baseline estimate across region and year. We find that in districts represented by the Democratic Party, the exposure effect on legislators’ voting on the passage of FTA is more negative than that on average. Another heterogeneous response is that in years when US major medias (====) reported more negative images of China, the negative effect of Chinese imports on legislators’ voting on FTA becomes larger.====As additional results, we find that, consistent with our baseline estimate, in districts with large Chinese import competition, legislators are also less likely to support free trade agreements that promote trade liberalization, although legislators in districts with large exposure to Chinese imports are more likely to vote in favor of unemployment assistance bills. Interestingly, we find that, in districts with large Chinese import competition, legislators are also more likely to support bills that may “hurt” China. This result, which might be inspired by job pressure and complaints by the electorate, is supported by U.S. citizens’ negative attitudes toward China.====Our paper is closely related to contributions that show that trade liberalization with China causally affects U.S. society via a variety of channels: manufacturing employment conditions (e.g., Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Pierce, Schott, 2016), health and mortality (McManus and Schaur, 2016; Pierce and Schott, 2020), household debt (Barrot et al., 2017) and provision of local public goods (Feler and Senses, 2017). Our study differs from this stream of literature in the sense that we ask, “Given or based on these established stylized facts, will U.S. legislators use legislation as a response to Chinese imports?”====Although our paper investigates the voting behavior of legislators, the logic of our story is related to papers investigating citizens’ responses to import competition in the United States. While Jensen et al. (2017) show that increasing imports in U.S. are associated with decreasing presidential incumbent vote shares, Che et al. (2017) find that citizens in regions that are hard hit by Chinese imports are more likely to vote for Democrats, who are supposed to protect the poor traditionally. Rather than looking at the response of ordinary citizens to Chinese imports, our paper investigates the response of the elected politicians who, by definition, should be responsible for the welfare of their constituency.====Our argument is also related to work on the effect of Chinese import competition on legislators’ voting behavior. Feigenbaum and Hall (2015) show that community-zone-adjusted district exposure to Chinese import changes for periods 1991-2000 and 2000-2007 had negative effects on the average district legislator’s voting score on trade-related issues for periods 1992-2000 and 2002-2010; using DW-Nominate score for legislators’ degree of conservativeness, Autor et al. (2017) find that community zone exposure to the change in the level of Chinese imports between 2002 and 2010 caused political polarization. Our paper differs from this literature in the following two aspects. First, this literature focuses on the within-district change in voting score (for trade bills or general bills) and thus extensive margin plays a role; we focus on the effect of Chinese import competition on the voting behavior of the same incumbent legislator.==== Second, our analysis focuses more on FTA (Conconi et al., 2012), PNTR, and China-related policy at the district level rather than all the issues raised in the House. In this light, our paper is more related to Conconi et al. (2012), though we are from the angle of exogenous surge in Chinese imports and our investigation of the heterogeneous effects on FTA and the exploration of other plausible outcomes may have provided a fuller picture on this topic.====Our paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we briefly present the historical background of FTA, discussing why it was introduced, how it functions, and its importance for signing Free Trade Agreement. This section also provides a detailed discussion of the economic rise of China and thus the supply shock of Chinese imports in developed countries. Section 3 discusses our empirical strategy. Section 4 describes the data that were collected for both independent and dependent variables and presents some basic descriptive statistics. Section 5 discusses our baseline results and robustness checks. Section 6 provides the reasons underlying our baseline results while section 7 explores heterogeneous responses. Section 8 presents extensions of the main results and section 9 concludes.","Import competition, fast-track authority and U.S. policy toward China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300172,23 June 2020,2020,Research Article,158.0

The current findings in developed countries have documented that immigrants' earnings growth exceeds that of natives and that immigrants upgrade their occupations over time. Three possible explanations for these observations are suggested in the literature: 1) immigrants accumulate more human capital than natives, 2) immigrants are not able to fully transfer their skills, so over time, they restore the value of source-country human capital, and 3) immigrants are more productive than natives because they are positively selected on ability. This study investigates the labor market outcomes of immigrants in low-income countries and finds that immigrants earn more than comparable natives and work in better-paid occupations. Over time the gap in earnings and occupational distribution between immigrants and natives narrows. This observation is more consistent with the predictions of human capital accumulation theory than with skill transferability and selection theories.","The existing studies on the labor market outcomes of immigrants are based on developed countries. These studies have shown that immigrants earn less than natives with comparable characteristics and work in low-paid occupations (Dowhan and Duleep [24], 25], Antecol et al. [6], Winkelmann [67], Dustmann et al. [31], Zorlu [69]). Furthermore, the gap in the labor market outcomes between immigrants and natives closes over time, with immigrants catching up with natives in terms of earnings and occupational status (Chiswick [18], 19], Chiswick et al. [20], 22], Duleep and Regets [28], 29], 30], Akresh [2], Green [36], Mattoo et al. [50], Zorlu [69], Dustmann et al. [31], Barrett and Duffy [7]).====Three potential theories explain the narrowing of the gap in the labor market outcomes between immigrants and natives: human capital accumulation, selection, and skill transferability. According to the human capital accumulation theory, the differences in earnings and occupational distribution of immigrants relative to natives reflect the differences in their human capital endowments (Hendricks [39], Hendricks and Schoellman [40], Schoellman [60], Lagakos et al. [45]), and thus, the closing of the gap in the labor market outcomes between immigrants and natives is explained by immigrants investing more in human capital than natives do (Duleep and Regets [30], 28], 29]). The inability of immigrants to fully transfer skills they acquired in their birth countries is another source of the immigrant-native gap in economic performance (Chiswick [18], 19]). The skill transferability theory suggests that immigrants cannot fully transfer their skills, and over time, they increase the labor market value of source-country skills and/or invest in host-country-specific skills. The third explanation of higher earnings growth for immigrants is attributed to their self-selection, according to which immigrants are more productive than natives because the former are positively selected on productive characteristics.====To distinguish between the theories, this paper looks at immigrants in low-income countries, where they earn more and hold better-paid occupations than natives. Human capital theory suggests that the gap in labor market outcomes should narrow due to opportunity costs associated with investments in human capital, whereas skill transferability and selection theories suggest that the gap should widen if immigrants experience skill loss and if they are positively selected on learning abilities. The purpose of the paper is to empirically investigate whether we actually see this by analyzing the changes in the labor market outcomes of workers for three Latin American countries: Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela.====This paper begins by documenting the first key fact that immigrants in Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela perform better than observationally similar natives in terms of earnings and occupations. The empirical analysis shows that the earnings of immigrants are higher than those of natives and that the gap persists within occupations. The study also finds that the occupational distribution of immigrants first-order stochastically dominates that of the native-born population, meaning that immigrants work in high-paid occupations more often than natives do.====By investigating the changes in the relative earnings and employment patterns of immigrants over time, the paper establishes the second key fact that the earnings of immigrants grow more slowly than those of natives and that immigrants downgrade their occupations relative to natives. The initial earnings of the 1980–1990 and 1990–2000 arrival cohorts of immigrants in Brazil are 35% and 18% higher than those of natives with similar labor market characteristics, respectively. Examining the economic behavior of the cohorts over 2 to 3 decades shows that the gap in wages between the 1980–1990 and 1990–2000 arrival cohorts and natives has fallen to 14% and 15%, respectively. Moreover, the wage gain from changing occupational distribution relative to natives for less-skilled immigrants is -0.74% and -6.6%, and for high-skilled immigrants, it is -1.13% and -6.09% after 10 and 20 years of stay in Brazil, respectively.====These empirical findings are more consistent with the human capital accumulation theory than skill transferability and selection theories. The convergence in earnings and occupational distribution of immigrants and natives suggests that skill transferability is less of an issue for immigrants in low-income countries. Moreover, as a proxy for imperfect skill transfer, the paper compares the share of college-educated migrants in high-skill occupations to that of nonmigrant workers in the source countries and shows that immigrants are less likely to experience skill loss after migration. Data comparing education levels of migrants and nonmigrants suggest that migrants are positively selected on schooling, which implies that the self-selection of immigrants is unlikely to explain the closing of the gaps in economic performance as expressed both in terms of earnings and occupational status.====The analysis contributes to the literature on immigrants and human capital accumulation in its use of data from low-income countries. Although immigrants’ economic performance is well-studied in the literature, the questions examined here have not been addressed for immigrants in low-income countries. This analysis enables a disentangling of the implications of the selection, skill transferability, and human capital accumulation theories.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the census data obtained from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. Section 4.1 examines the differences in earnings and occupational distribution between immigrants and natives. Section 4.2 provides empirical evidence on the convergence between the labor market outcomes of immigrants and natives. Section 4.3 investigates the characteristics of migrants and nonmigrants to distinguish between the theories.

To this end, we propose a method to estimate an extended input-output (IO) table that tracks inter-sector transactions between different types of firms in a domestic economy. The method is an application of constrained optimization, which relies on basic information from a country's national IO table, as well as sector- and firm-level data. We also propose a way to construct bootstrapped standard errors for any global value chain (GVC) measures estimated from the extended IO tables. We then use the extended IO table to study the domestic segment of GVC in China. We find that, not only is state-owned enterprises’ (SOEs) domestic value-added to gross exports ratio much higher than those of other firms, but it also increased significantly from 1.2 in 2007 to 1.7 in 2010. Our findings suggest that, even after years of privatization, SOEs still play an important role in shaping China's exports.","China's unprecedented economic growth in the past three decades is often attributed to its market-oriented reforms (Branstetter and Lardy, 2006). The Chinese government actively sought to privatize state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which contributed to the country's significant productivity increases and economic growth (Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, Zhang, 2012; Zhu, 2012).====While the role of SOEs in the Chinese economy has been diminishing in the past few decades (Lardy, 2014), recent evidence points to a resurgence in the role of SOEs in the economy, especially because of the monopoly power they command in key upstream sectors, such as banking, electricity, and hydrocarbons.==== This phenomenon is not unique to China. A recent OECD study reveals that SOEs still command a significant share of large emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia, and India, in terms of both sales and assets (Kowalski et al., 2013).====This paper seeks to document whether the changing domestic segment of global value chains (GVC) contributed to the resurgence of state capitalism in China. We study the question from the perspective of international trade, by analyzing SOEs’ contribution to China's domestic value added (DVA) in exports. More specifically, we answer the following questions: In which sectors did SOEs still possess a dominant presence? How did the changing distribution of SOEs across sectors along the GVC shape other firms’ participation in trade? How might downstream firms’ increasing exports help explain the revived dominance of SOEs in China?====To answer these questions, we first develop a framework to use firm-level data to expand a standard input-output (IO) table into a more detailed account that reports inter-sector firm transactions within the economy. Our method belongs to the large class of quadratic optimization models,==== which feature a minimization of a quadratic penalty function with arguments equal to the values of the extended IO table, subject to a series of accounting identities and adding-up constraints based on official statistics (e.g., industry-level exports and imports). The method only requires a minimal set of information: (1) a country's national IO table, (2) firm balance-sheet data, and (3) trade statistics by firm group and sector. As an additional literature contribution, we propose a way to compute the standard errors for the estimates of the extended IO table, using samples bootstrapped from the underlying micro data.====We implement the optimization model using China's IO tables for 2007 and 2010, along with 2008 census data for both manufacturing and service firms.==== Firms are categorized into four groups based on their equity ownership structure and size: state-owned, foreign, large private, and small and medium-sized private (SMEs). We then estimate the value of the IO transactions between firm group pairs in the extended tables using our proposed constrained quadratic optimization method. Based on these estimates, we quantify the contributions of different domestic IO channels to Chinese DVA in exports.====We find that, in China, SOEs’ DVA in exports is significantly larger than the value of their gross exports. This contrasts the conventional view that Chinese exports are associated with a lower domestic value added to gross exports ratio (DVAR) (Chen et al., 2012; Koopman et al., 2008). Specifically, the DVAR of SOEs is estimated to be 1.7 in 2010, up 47% from 1.2 in 2007. Among private firms, large firms’ DVA ratio is around 0.7 while that of SMEs is above 1 for both years (1 and 1.3 in 2007 and 2010, respectively). Foreign firms’ DVAR hovers around 0.35 for both years.==== In sum, SOEs’ and SMEs’ DVAR's are much larger than those of other types of firms, and that of aggregate exports.====To address the concern that our estimates can be imprecise or sensitive to the initial conditions and constraints imposed in the optimization, we propose a way to construct bootstrapped standard errors for all estimated GVC measures using extended IO tables. This procedure involves simulating thousands of IO tables using constraints and initial values constructed with data from randomly drawn firm samples. The bootstrapped standard errors for our estimates show that the estimation results in general are robust to the choices of initial values in the objective function and linear constraints.====Equipped with the extended IO tables, we study the pattern of domestic trade transactions between different types of firms in China. We find that indirect exports (exports through other firms) accounted for about 80% of SOEs’ DVA in both 2007 and 2010. In fact, about 40% of their DVA was indirect exports through SME and foreign firms. This suggests that despite their relatively small engagement in direct exports, SOEs’ actual participation in, and therefore impact on, China's exports have been significant. Similarly, large private firms and SMEs also have a large share of indirect exports in DVA. Different from all other firm groups, foreign firms tend to have significantly lower DVA ratios, both direct and indirect.====We also use the extended IO tables to analyze the reasons behind the high and rising indirect export participation by both SOEs and SMEs. Focusing on the sectoral composition of indirect exports by firm group, we find that SOEs’ indirect exports relate to their prevalence, measured by output and export shares, in upstream and mostly non-tradable sectors, such as banking, mining, energy, and the supply of electricity, gas and water. We also find that SOEs are, on average, more upstream in GVC ==== sectors, based on the “upstreamness” measures proposed by Antràs et al. (2012) and Fally, 2012. These patterns are outcomes of the unique sequence of China's privatization across sectors, which started from the downstream, competitive sectors of the supply chains in the late 1990s but ended without the privatization of upstream, monopolistic sectors. Given that many upstream sector firms, especially those in the utilities sector, do not export directly, their exports are largely indirect and embedded as value added in other firms’ exports. As such, firms in upstream sectors or in the relatively upstream position within a sector tend to have a high DVAR in exports. The prevalence of SOEs in upstream sectors or in upstream positions within a sector, thus, explains their relatively higher DVA ratio.====SMEs also have high DVA and indirect export ratios, but for very different reasons from those for SOEs. SMEs are on average more downstream along GVC within sectors. Possibly because of high fixed costs of exporting that are difficult to overcome, they have greater propensity to sell intermediate inputs and services to direct exporters, including trade intermediaries. These analyses of the ownership structure of GVC inside China can offer important insights for understanding the country's past and future economic growth.====Despite this paper's focus on China, our estimation framework is general enough to be applied to a wide range of topics in trade and economic geography, such as the propagation of demand or supply shocks across sectors and regions within an economy, the benefits for SME to participate in GVC even without direct exports, and the distribution of gains from trade across sectors and regions.====This paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, it adds to the growing literature on the measurement of global production fragmentation using IO tables (e.g., Hummels et al., 2001; Koopman, Wang, and Wei, 2014; Johnson and Noguera, 2016), which has focused on the shares of domestic versus foreign value added in international trade while paying relatively little attention to the composition and dynamics of the domestic segment of GVC. More specifically, relatively few studies have explored how international trade shapes domestic trade between firms and industries.==== The two notable exceptions are Koopman et al., 2012 and Ma et al., 2015.==== This paper improves upon existing studies on several fronts. First and foremost, on the methodological front, we show how to compute standard errors for all estimates in our extended IO table and the related estimates. Second, our firm census data set covers many more firms, including all SMEs. Third, our research focus is vastly different. Koopman et al., 2012 focus on correcting the upward bias in the estimated domestic content in exports when processing trade is pervasive. Ma et al., 2015, on the other hand, focus on the respective contributions of foreign and domestic exporters to China's GDP. This paper offers a more detailed account of the domestic segment of GVC, and specifically highlights the much higher DVAR of SOEs, a unique aspect of the domestic segment of GVC in China.====Relating to the literature on trade in value-added, our approach extends the IO table approach to take firm heterogeneity in international trade—an important aspect emphasized by the recent trade literature—into account.==== Firms differ substantially in export intensity, import intensity, and participation in GVC. Other characteristics such as ownership structure (domestic/foreign, private/public), location, and size can also directly affect the way firms respond to trade liberalization and other economic shocks. Aggregate IO tables offer no information about the underlying firm heterogeneity. Unless buyer-seller linked data are available, which represents a recent phenomenon (e.g., Tintelnot et al., 2018), reducing the aggregation biases in GVC measures computed using aggregate IO tables is not feasible.==== By proposing a method to extend a typical IO table, our paper offers a solution to reduce the aggregation biases arising from specific aspects of firm heterogeneity.====This paper also contributes to the literature on the determinants of firms’ indirect exporting. Research in international trade shows that only a small fraction of firms, typically the more productive ones that expect enough export profits to overcome fixed exporting costs, participate in international trade directly (e.g., Bernard et al., 2015). Many non-exporters may engage in trade indirectly, through intermediaries and by providing intermediate inputs and services to direct exporters. While the literature on trade intermediaries has received some attention (e.g., Bernard et al., 2010 and Ahn et al., 2011), how much value added is generated from exporting indirectly though other firms has not received the attention it deserves, partly due to the lack of data.==== Our paper provides a method that combines firm-level and industry-level data to quantify indirect export volumes, and the channels through which they are created.====On the methodological front, our paper contributes to previous attempts to cast the estimation of unknown values in IO tables as a constrained matrix balancing problem (van der Ploeg, 1988, Nagurney and Robinson, 1989, Bartholdy, 1991). It also adds to the information theory literature on estimating inter-region transactions using regional economic statistics and input-output accounts (Batten, 1982; Batten and Martellato, 1985, Canning and Wang, 2005). In particular, our paper is closely related to Golan, Judge and Robinson (1994), who also pose the estimation as an optimization problem with a nonlinear criterion objective function and multiple linear constraints.====Finally, this paper adds to the broad literature on the progress of privatization and the role of SOEs in the Chinese economy (e.g., Brandt et al, 2012; Zhu, 2012; Hsieh and Song, 2015).==== As opposed to existing studies, we focus on quantifying the trade pattern of SOEs, and how it affects and is affected by trade among other firms.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 develops the conceptual framework for our estimation. Section 3 introduces the optimization model. Section 4 describes the data sources and the initial conditions of the optimization procedures. Section 5 explains how conventional bootstrapping can be combined with our method to compute standard errors for our estimates. Section 6 applies the method by studying the estimated DVA for different firm groups in China, focusing on SOEs; and Section 7 concludes.",Domestic segment of global value chains in China under state capitalism,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300160,12 June 2020,2020,Research Article,160.0

The paper distinguishes between two strategies for decentralization of firms in an environment with weak institutions: decentralization of decision-making authority to professionals hired through open competition (real decentralization) and decentralization to people hired through connections (cautious decentralization). The paper argues that real decentralization has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of firms and therefore can have economic payoff for firms even under weak institutions. However, the higher the distortionary effect of corruption on fair market competition in an environment with weak institutions, the lower the firms’ returns to being economically efficient. Therefore, the lower the returns to real decentralization, and, hence, the firms’ willingness to really decentralize. The empirical analysis presented in the paper demonstrates that really decentralized Russian firms are, on average, more successful compared to other firms in a range of activities: they are more likely to invest, to bring to the market innovative products that are new to the Russian or global market, and to export. The gap between really decentralized and other firms in the probability of investment and introduction of new products to the market is very substantial under low or moderate levels of corruption. However, the gap shrinks as corruption grows and disappears under very high levels of corruption. Correspondingly, real decentralization is less popular in Russian regions with higher corruption.","Can the decentralization of firms be successful in an environment with weak institutions? The practice of decentralization – the delegation of some decision-making authority from the top of a firm's managerial hierarchy down to middle-level and local employees – is becoming increasingly widespread at firms in developed countries. Decentralization has a huge potential to improve firms’ efficiency and competitiveness; it creates conditions for quicker and more competent decision-making on a wide range of questions and can enhance employee motivation. Although decentralization is associated with an increase in agency risk, there is growing evidence that in an environment with good institutions, the benefits that decentralization can bring to a firm can far outweigh its potential agency costs. But what about countries with weak institutions: poor social norms, high corruption, and weak judicial system? Agency costs of decentralization are expected to be much higher in such an environment. Evidence on the decentralization of firms in countries with weak institutions is still very limited. At the same time, there is a popular belief that decentralization cannot be successful in countries with weak institutions, so it is not worth even trying.====In this paper, I challenge this belief by studying evidence from Russian firms. Previous literature that studies the decentralization of firms in an environment with weak institutions primarily focuses on the high agency costs of decentralization in such conditions. In this paper, I look from another perspective, and pay more attention to the potential benefits that decentralization can bring to a firm, even under weak institutions. Even under weak institutions, decentralization, if implemented properly, can relieve the excessive workload of CEOs, significantly improve the speed and quality of decision-making at firms, and enlarge the scope of questions firms are able to respond to simultaneously, thus making the firms more competitive and creating opportunities for their growth. Moreover, decentralization can increase the involvement of employees, which may greatly improve their attitude toward work, intrinsic motivation, and productivity. Yet the potential of decentralization to improve the firm's efficiency is likely to be highly dependent on the professionalism and talent of the employees who gain the delegated authority.====I distinguish between two strategies for the decentralization of firms in an environment with weak institutions: the strategies of ==== and ==== decentralization. I introduce the concept of ==== to represent the decentralization of decision-making authority to people hired through open competition – that is, to the most professional and talented people a firm can hire – and the concept of ==== to represent decentralization to people hired through connections – to people whom firm owners or top managers trust on the basis of some sort of connections or recommendations, but who are not necessarily good professionals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that ==== is rather popular in economies with weak institutions. It is believed to be a good adaptation of the idea of decentralization to the conditions of weak institutions; however, its potential to improve firms’ efficiency seems to be quite limited. In this paper, I am primarily interested in ==== of firms in an environment with weak institutions.====I presume that the improvements in efficiency that can be brought to a firm by ==== can be so important that they can outweigh the expected costs associated with decentralization even under weak institutions. This assumption implies that ==== under weak institutions can be successful and can yield positive payoff to firms. However, I argue that the greater the role of non-market factors in the economic wellbeing of firms in an environment with weak institutions – for example, the higher the distortionary effect of corruption on fair market competition – the lower the firms’ returns to being economically efficient. The firms’ returns to ==== and thus their willingness to ==== will be correspondingly lower as well. I test these assumptions against the data on Russian firms and find that the data is consistent with the theory.====Institutional conditions in Russia are far from good. In 2014 – the year of focus in this study – Russia scored 27 out of 100 in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking much worse than many post-Communist Eastern European countries and similarly to a number of Central Asian and African countries. According to the data of the Russian Public Opinion Fund, more than 50% of Russian people do not condemn those who give bribes; 30% do not condemn those who take bribes. Russia's 2014 rule of law score from the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators was -0.7 out of a range from -2.5 (the worst) to 2.5 (the best). According to the World Values Survey 2011 data, only 28% of Russian people believe that most people can be trusted and 66% of Russians think that one needs to be very careful in dealing with people. Therefore, I believe that Russia represents a good case through which to study the decentralization of firms in an environment with weak institutions.====The empirical analysis of this paper is based on the data of the “Russian Firms in a Global Economy” (RuFIGE) survey, which was conducted by the Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia, in 2014. The survey provides information on the organizational choices; hiring strategies; investment, innovation, and export activities and outcomes; and other characteristics or choices of about 2,000 manufacturing firms across 60 Russian regions. To the best of my knowledge, RuFIGE is the only survey that combines information about firms’ choices regarding centralization or decentralization with information about criteria for hiring for top positions. This unique combination allows me to distinguish between firms’ strategies of ==== and ==== decentralization in the empirical analysis. I complement firm-level data from the RuFIGE survey with data on the quality of institutions in Russian regions estimated from the “Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey” (BEEPS) that was run by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in cooperation with the World Bank in Russian regions in 2011-2012 and data on trust in Russian regions estimated from the Russian Fund “Public Opinion” GeoRating-2014 Survey.====I demonstrate empirically that ==== Russian firms are, on average, more successful in a range of activities: they are more likely to invest, to bring to the market innovative products that are new for the Russian or global market, and to export their production, compared to other firms. At the same time, no significant difference in the probability of investment, of introduction of innovative products, or of exporting products is observed between the other groups of firms – cautiously decentralized firms, centralized firms that hire competitively for top positions, and centralized firms that hire through connections. The difference between really decentralized firms and other Russian firms in the probability of investment and of introduction of new products to the market depends on the level of corruption: this difference diminishes as corruption in the region grows. Accordingly, in Russian regions with higher corruption, firms are less likely to be really decentralized. Yet the gap between really decentralized firms and other Russian firms in the probability of investment, of introduction of new products, and of exporting products is impressively large under low, moderate, and even median (for Russian regions covered by both the RuFIGE and the BEEPS samples) levels of corruption.====The empirical results presented in this paper imply that there is considerable room for the successful decentralization of firms under a wide range of institutional conditions, including rather poor conditions like those seen in Russia. The results demonstrate that the strategy of ====, which is traditionally considered to be very risky under conditions of weak institutions, can work fairly well and have economic payoff for firms even in an environment with weak institutions (at least, payoff in terms of the likelihood of investment, introduction of new products, and export). At the same time, the strategy of ==== does not improve firms’ outcomes with regard to chances to invest, to bring new products to the market, and to export. The paper also presents a novel channel through which corruption can limit the real decentralization of firms, arguing that corruption, in particular the distortionary effect of corruption on fair market competition, can reduce the value of economic efficiency for firms and, thus, the potential value of real decentralization and firms’ willingness to really decentralize. The paper presents empirical support for this argument, highlighting a mechanism of the negative influence of corruption on economic development that has not been studied in prior research.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Our sample includes 134 countries (1975-2014). We employ spatial patterns and biological characteristics as ==== for culture. The results show that culture is an important predictor for the generosity of welfare states: welfare provision is higher in countries with loose family ties and individualistic attitudes, high prevalence of trust and tolerance, and low acceptance of unequally distributed power. These channels explain 20-50% of the cross-country variation in welfare provision. Cultural heterogeneity (diversity) influences redistribution non-linearly: moderate diversity levels impede redistribution, while higher levels offset the negative effect.","Cross-country differences in the generosity of welfare states are large and persistent. Public redistribution has reduced income inequality by an average of 34% in the OECD, but the numbers vary greatly from almost 50% in Denmark, Sweden, and Germany to roughly 25% in the United States and Switzerland and less than 10% in South Korea and Chile.==== An important question is why these differences arise. The standard economic model describes that unequally distributed market incomes give rise to redistribution preferences of the electorate and increase welfare systems via household voting behavior (Meltzer and Richard, 1981). The “redistribution hypothesis” has found some support in empirical studies (Milanovic, 2000, Scervini, 2012), but the relationship between market inequality and income redistribution has often been found to be weak (Kenworthy and McCall, 2008).====There are several explanations for why the redistribution hypothesis is poorly reflected in the data, including prospects of upwards mobility (Bénabou and Ok, 2001), influence and power of the rich (Ursprung and Breyer, 1998), misperceptions of inequality (Cruces, Perez-Truglia, Tetaz, 2013, Gründler, Köllner, 2017), and high deadweight costs (Harms and Zink, 2003). In this paper, we show that much of the cross-country differences in welfare policies depend on cultural socialization, as learned cultural behavior influences judgments about fairness and solidarity with other individuals.====Studies in psychology and sociology have shown that the ways in which individuals think, feel, and act in response to social issues vary systematically across countries and have their roots in so-called “mental programs”, which are influenced by the social environment and passed from one generation to the next (Hofstede, 2001, Oyserman, Lee, 2008). Psychological experiments also show that subjective status (Arrindell et al., 1997) and judgments about fairness (Gelfand, Higgins, Nishii, Raver, Dominguez, Murakami, Susumu, Toyama, 2002, Hoffmann, Tee, 2006) depend on cultural socialization. These studies suggest that culture plays an important role in determining individuals’ support for welfare provision. In a similar vein, Carillo and Gromb (2006) have shown that cultural inertia can influence organizations.====Understanding how culture influences the welfare state is also important for political reasons, given that the past few years saw the highest level of human displacement on record. Roughly 65 million people around the world were forcibly displaced, 21 million of them having escaped war or political pressure and seeking refuge in foreign countries (UNHCR, 2016). Consequently, ethnic, cultural, and religious diversity in immigration countries has increased, which in turn is likely to influence social security systems via two mechanisms: first, preferences for redistribution of immigrants are determined by their country of birth and often deviate from the preferences of the native population (Luttmer and Singhal, 2011). Second, increasing diversity may reduce the native population’s support for redistribution because of cultural protectionism and fear of unemployment (Blanchflower, Shadforth, 2009, Dahlberg, Edmark, Lundqvist, 2012, Stichnoth, Van der Straeten, 2013). Empirical evidence suggests that individuals decrease their support for welfare spending as the share of local recipients from other racial or religious groups rises (Luttmer, 2001, Freier, Geys, Holm, 2016).====We empirically investigate the effects of culture and diversity on the welfare state and provide three new contributions: first, we examine the extent to which cultural socialization explains cross-country differences in the generosity of welfare systems. Our analysis uses a broad cross-country perspective that sheds light on the different mechanisms through which cultural traits translate to welfare policies. Second, we disentangle the effects of culture and institutions by employing an instrumental variable strategy that exploits spatial patterns and biological characteristics. Third, we examine how cultural and ethnic heterogeneity (“diversity”) influence welfare provision.====Our analysis adds to the burgeoning literature on the political and economic consequences of culture. Scholars have examined the role of culture for economic outcomes (Guiso, Sapienza, Zingales, 2006, Alesina, Giuliano, 2015, Gorodnichenko, Roland, 2017), but the effect of culture and diversity on public welfare policies remains largely unexplored. Some studies associate historical and cultural factors with the organization of the welfare state (Huber, Stephens, 2001, Brooks, Manza, 2006, Berigan, Irwin, 2011, Rivera-Rozo, García-Huitrón, Steenbeek, van der Lecq, 2018), but rigorous cross-country analyses on the role of cultural socialization for welfare provision are scarce (Pfau-Effinger, 2005).====Cross-country studies concerned with redistribution and cultural values face two important challenges: (i) the acquisition of comparable harmonized data on inequality and redistribution and (ii) the need to disentangle cultural values from institutions. Previous analyses respond to these challenges by employing specific fiscal policy instruments or preferences to measure redistribution, and simply ignore the entanglement of institutions and culture or use preferences for redistribution of immigrants as instruments (the “epidemiological approach”, see Fernández, 2011, Luttmer, Singhal, 2011). However, the volumes of tax revenues and transfers provide little information about their redistributive effect (Causa and Hermansen, 2017), and measures that gauge redistribution preferences are often biased.==== Moreover, the weak spot of the epidemiological approach is that different groups of immigrants may well encounter different informal institutional frameworks (Maseland, 2013). We use novel strategies to deal with both issues. Rather than examining preferences, we measure the generosity of welfare states via the “pre-post-approach” (Lupu, Pontusson, 2011, Gozgor, Ranjan, 2017), which gauges redistribution via the differences of gross and net inequality. Data on inequality pre and post taxes and transfers comes from the ==== (SWIID) of Solt (2016). The SWIID has significantly increased the availability of cross-nationally comparable inequality data, covering 174 countries from 1960 to 2016 and encompassing some 4,600 country-year observations on inequality before and after taxes and transfers. Another advantage of the SWIID is that it provides 100 multiply-imputed values for each country-year observation. We therefore address data uncertainty in inequality series, whereas earlier studies rely on point estimates of fiscal policy measures and redistribution preferences that are prone to measurement errors (Atkinson and Brandolini, 2001). Furthermore, our analysis is based on two strategies to compute instrumental variables for culture. The first strategy exploits spatial patterns of culture by constructing jack-knifed regional averages of cultural traits, following the nascent literature that employs “sharp” instruments (see, e.g., Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, Robinson, 2019, Cherif, Husanov, Wang, 2018). The second strategy draws on the theory of “co-evolution” of culture and genes advanced in the biological literature (Chiao, Blizinsky, 2010, Way, Lieberman, 2010). This theory describes that cultures and genes have developed in parallel, as parents transmit both their genes and their cultural values to their children. In accord to this theory, biological studies found strong correlations between cultural variables and specific genetic markers (Way and Lieberman, 2010). Our set of biological characteristics includes genes measured via blood type frequencies (Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2017) and prevalence of the pathogen ==== (Maseland, 2013).====The results show that culture plays an important role for the generosity of welfare systems, and this role manifests in three channels: (i) the degree of integration of individuals into a cohesive group and the strength of family ties, (ii) solidarity and the acceptance of differences in status and power, and (iii) attitudes towards unknown situations. In particular, collectivist societies with strong kinship ties provide their members with a family-based social safety net and feature lower degrees of redistribution. In contrast, individualistic societies that lack family insurance have greater need for public provision of social protection. The results also show that solidarity with other individuals is important for welfare policies. Support for the indigent is weaker in countries that accept an unequal distribution of power and that consider hard work to be key to success. Attitudes towards the unknown affect public redistribution in two ways. First, trust and tolerance towards members outside the own social group increase the support for equalizing policies, because they promote the belief that fellow citizens do not exploit welfare programs. Second, discomfort in uncertain situations raises private insurance and lessens the need for social security on the state level.====The results are robust to changes in the empirical strategy. We account for many potential confounding factors and effects that may violate our exclusion restriction, including the institutional framework and the income distribution (Gründler and Köllner, 2017), globalization (Ursprung, 2008, Potrafke, 2015), geographical location (Alesina and Giuliano, 2015), government ideology (Pickering and Rockey, 2011), and religion (Potrafke, 2012). Inferences also do not change if we account for the uncertainty in inequality series and use alternative measures to proxy the generosity of welfare systems.====Finally, we examine the consequences of cultural heterogeneity for welfare provision and show that the linear relationship between diversity and redistribution is inconclusive, although diversity tends to be negatively associated with welfare provision. When we account for non-linearity in the relationship between diversity and redistribution (Selway, 2011), we find that the negative effect of diversity is pronounced in countries with an ethnic, religious or cultural majority, and reverses once a threshold of roughly 50% of our diversity measures is exceeded. We explain this pattern by two mechanisms. In countries with low levels of diversity, individuals prefer that welfare be received by members of their own group (“racial group loyalty” or “anti-solidarity effect”). When diversity exceeds a certain tipping point, individuals perceive greater risk of income loss to migrants or members from other social groups. Hence, demand for redistribution rises to insure against this subjective threat (“compensation effect”). We find evidence for both mechanisms on the macro-level and at the micro-level.","Culture, diversity, and the welfare state",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300366,10 June 2020,2020,Research Article,162.0

Yet, there is little evidence showing that increases in state capacity lowers the use of violent informal institutions to resolve disputes. Utilizing a novel dataset of violence—specifically, duels—across American states in the 19th century, we use the spread of federal post offices as an identification strategy to investigate the importance of state capacity for the incidence of violent dispute resolution. We find that post office density is a strong, consistent, and negative predictor of dueling behavior. Our evidence contributes to a burgeoning literature on the importance of state capacity for development outcomes.","On July 11, 1804 in Weehawken, New Jersey, the rivalry between two giants of the American founding generation, the inaugural Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, and Vice President, Aaron Burr, came to a bloody apex. Bitter political foes, the enmity between the two culminated on this day with a duel by pistols. Following standard dueling protocol, Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel, having been offended by Hamilton’s successful campaign to defeat Burr’s bid for the governorship of New York. At the same location that Hamilton’s son was killed in a duel three years earlier by a Burr supporter, Burr mortally wounded Hamilton. While dueling was illegal in both New York (their home state) and New Jersey (and both states charged Burr with murder and a grand jury in New Jersey indicted him), the charges were ultimately dropped (Winfield, 1874). Burr would go on to complete his term as Vice President without prejudice.====Clearly, such a bloody affair was an inefficient resolution to a long-standing conflict between these two men. Moreover, the failure of the state to adequately punish Burr maintained an unfortunate precedent, as many more duels would be fought on this spot in the subsequent years.==== Does this event, and the pervasiveness in this period of dueling to solve conflicts, reflect a long-ago “culture of violence”? Did duels serve as the “[rules] that [were] neither promulgated by an official source, such as a court of a legislature, nor enforced by threat of legal sanctions, yet [were] regularly complied with” (Posner, 1997, p. 365)? Or does the weakness of the early republic’s formal political institutions better explain the pervasiveness of this violent informal institution?====Answering this question is important to our understanding of the incidence of violence and peaceful conflict resolution across societies. Indeed, scholars have long argued that a society’s ability to resolve disputes efficiently and non-violently is essential to not only maintaining order but a critical pillar of development.==== In weakly-institutionalized societies, informal institutions and norms play a more central role in dispute resolution (Milgrom and North, 1990). Yet, societies that can rely on formal institutions to adjudicate disputes and credibly enforce its rules are less prone to break down into violence, especially when reputation and commitment problems are present (Bates, 2001, North, Wallis, Weingast, 2009).====For any formal system to be effective, however, the state must have the capacity to not only adjudicate disputes fairly but also enforce compliance to its ruling. Scholars in comparative political economy have increasingly focused on the importance of the state’s capacity to enforce its rule as an important determinant of economic development (Acemoglu, Garcia-Jimeno, Robinson, 2015, Besley, Persson, 2009, Dell, Lane, Querubin, 2018, Dincecco, Katz, 2014, Michalopoulos, Papaioannou, 2013, Rogowski et al., 2020, e.g.,). Despite the prominence of this view, there is a paucity of comparative empirical evidence that identifies the effects of state strength on minimizing violence, especially informal institutions to resolve conflicts. There is even less empirical evidence using panel data measuring within-unit changes in state capacity on changing rates of the use of violence to resolve disputes.====In this paper, we investigate the role that state capacity had on the incidence of dueling using a panel of American states over the 19th century. Like many developing countries, the pre-20th-century U.S. states were in the early stages of political and economic development and, especially in the early 19th century, remained an overwhelmingly pre-industrialized and agriculture-based society.==== Minimal infrastructural development severely constrained the ability of state governments to impose their rule, especially in the interior hinterland. Hence, an institutional environment of weak states, which continues to characterize many societies in the world today, also characterized many of the U.S. states in this period. Yet, in critical ways, as we discuss below, the degree of institutional and economic development varied significantly across states and time. Exploiting these contextual features, we investigate the relationship between state capacity and the spatial and temporal incidence of dueling in a panel of all states using a novel dataset consisting of all duels that occurred in the 19th century as reported in over 1000 newspapers (Byron, 2008).====Following Acemoglu et al. (2016) and Rogowski et al. (2020), we use the number of federal post offices in existence at the state level as a proxy of early investments in “infrastructural” state capacity.==== This not only provides a plausibly exogenous source of variation across states and time in state capacity, as post office locations were determined by the federal government, it is also a good measure of the extent of the federal government in the early Republic. For instance, in 1841, nearly 80% of all civilian federal employees worked for the post office (John, 2009, p. 3). A recent literature has demonstrated the crucial economic and political role that post offices played in spreading information and creating a network that connected the geographically large and sparsely populated country (Acemoglu, Moscona, Robinson, 2016, John, 2009, Rogowski et al., 2020, e.g.,). Given that mail was only transported from post office to post office until the late 19th century, proximity to a post office was vital to being connected to the country’s political and economic life. Perhaps, more critically, post offices were the primary investments by the federal government in infrastructural capacity during this period, especially in the country’s vast interior. As a result, Acemoglu et al. (2016, p. 62) claim that the “presence of a post office is indicative of a much broader state presence and functionality, for example, via legal services and regulation, access to land, and security of other forms of property rights.”====Using American states in a panel model allows us to minimize many of the omitted factors that bias cross-national empirical studies. Namely, the states shared the same colonial history, and did not vary as significantly as countries in terms of cultural, linguistic, and religious diversity. Our empirical strategy also allows us to control for variation across states in a number of institutional factors that could explain the reliance on formal institutions and which are often observed jointly with increases in state capacity. Namely, we control for the timing in which states removed economic suffrage restrictions on adult white men, political party competition, and whether state-level judges were given lifetime appointments (and therefore plausibly more insulated from local politics). Furthermore, we also control for economic development and other regional factors that could influence the incidence of dueling. Even after accounting for these confounding factors, we find that post office density has a large, negative effect on the incidence of dueling. This is true whether the duel took place in the South, a region in which dueling’s pervasiveness is often explained by a prevailing “culture of honor” (Greenberg, 1990, e.g.,).====We add additional support to our baseline findings by using multiple lagged panel models to show that early expansions in the density of post offices predicts increases in later state-level fiscal capacity, specifically, greater per capita state tax revenues. This supports our claim that the federal government’s investment in post offices, which we call infrastructural capacity, facilitated the expansion in the capacity of state governments. Our results also survive a series of robustness tests. Specifically, we show that our results hold whether or not we measure the number of post offices on the basis of population (i.e., per capita) or county area (i.e., per square mile) and, furthermore, are robust to the inclusion of state and decade fixed effects.====These findings provide one of the first comparative designs that shows that increases in state capacity reduce the use of violent informal institutions to resolve disputes. Furthermore, our data and strategy of using federally-determined post offices allow us to identify the effects of state capacity independently of other state-level institutional factors that might influence the use of dueling. Not only does this contribute to the recent literature on the importance of early investments in state capacity on later development outcomes (Dincecco, Katz, 2014, Michalopoulos, Papaioannou, 2013, Rogowski et al., 2020, e.g.,), our evidence also suggests that one critical channel by which this happens is through the reduction of violent informal institutions to resolve disputes.",Going postal: State capacity and violent dispute resolution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300378,9 June 2020,2020,Research Article,163.0

These results appear to hold in most regions of the world and suggest that governments perceive foreign economic dynamism as a threat, leading them to reduce their CTRs to maintain their FDI attractiveness.","Corporate income tax rates (CTRs) have fallen substantially worldwide over the past decades. Between 1995 and 2015, the median (top marginal) statutory tax rate in both developed and developing countries declined by nearly one-third, from about 35% to 24%. Researchers on European and OECD economies attribute this shift towards lower taxes on profits to tax competition between countries eager to retain and attract capital, notably foreign direct investment (FDI), in an increasingly integrated world economy (Davies, Voget, 2008, Devereux, Lockwood, Redoano, 2008, Overesch and Rincke (2011), Redoano, 2014). This trend is likely to persist as special regimes (e.g. patent box, interest reductions, ruling arrangements) are discouraged by the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project adopted by over 130 collaborating countries, progressively leaving CTR cutting as the only tool to attract FDI.==== The aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the drivers of international tax competition. The existing empirical research investigates this issue by testing whether a country’s CTR is partly determined by the CTR of other countries. In doing so, this literature finds substantial evidence for the existence of strategic interactions between governments. For example, the seminal paper of Devereux et al. (2008), which focuses on 21 OECD countries for the period 1982–1999, shows that countries open to capital flows compete over their CTRs.==== This strand of research has strongly improved our understanding of tax competition. However, it neglects a key insight from the recent theoretical tax competition literature: that relative market size should also matter.====Recent tax competition models acknowledge that countries are not symmetric. A country with a large market can afford to impose a higher CTR than a smaller country because it offers a more attractive environment due to its larger market (Haufler, Wooton, 1999, Haufler and Wooton, (2010)) and agglomeration economies (Baldwin, Krugman, 2004, Ottaviano, Ypersele, 2005).==== These models suggest, in a world where FDI tends to be market-seeking, that a government ought to perceive, all other things equal, faster growth in neighbouring countries as a threat, leading it to adjust downward its CTR to maintain its attractiveness for FDI. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate empirically the relevance of this theoretical proposition, by considering market-based (indirect) tax competition as another spatial determinant of CTRs. More precisely, we estimate a spatial dynamic fixed-effects model with country-specific trends in which we take into account not only the weighted average of foreign CTRs but also the weighted average of foreign GDPs. Given the nature of our econometric model, we investigate in practice whether CTRs are influenced by out-of-trend foreign growth performance.====While tax competition amongst developed countries has been investigated in a large number of papers, the same cannot be said in the case of developing countries.==== This is a puzzling omission given that CTRs in these countries have also strongly fallen in the last decade. Our second contribution to the literature is to shed light on the extent of tax competition in the developing regions of the world. Using a variety of sources, we have created a database of statutory CTRs covering a large number of developed and developing countries for the period 1995–2014. Our largest sample includes 38 EU-OECD countries and 76 other countries. This is a significant improvement on databases used previously.==== We look at tax competition within geographical regions as well as within free-trade zones, given that regional economic integration ought to be stronger in such sub-sets of countries. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first study to comprehensively look at strategic interactions between governments of developing countries.====Our key result is that CTRs are lower when the growth performance of geographically close countries is particularly strong. This relationship is especially robust in EU and OECD countries and in several developing regions. Further investigations indicate that this market-based spatial effect is stronger if neighbouring countries are developed, large, and open to capital flows. In contrast to previous research, we have not found strong statistical evidence of direct competition over CTRs, although our econometric approach and period of investigation may prevent us from identifying this. All in all, and in agreement with asymmetry-based tax competition models (Haufler, Wooton, 1999, Haufler and Wooton, (2010)), our results suggest that market-based considerations of relative international attractiveness is a driver of tax competition for FDI.====The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the tax competition literature, with an emphasis on models dealing with asymmetric market size. Section 3 describes our spatial econometric approach and the data.

Subsequent studies unveil additional determinants of ratings, such as exchange reserves or the current account balance (Afonso et al., 2014; Ratha et al., 2011), the fiscal balance, trade openness or institutions (Bario and Packer, 2004), political business cycles (Block and Vaaler, 2004), monetary policy regimes (Balima et al., 2017), or the fiscal transparency (Hameed, 2005). Regarding the latter, the literature reveals that a sovereign rating change affects the re-rated country bond market (Gande and Parsley, 2005), stock market (Kaminsky and Schmukler, 2002), credit default swaps market (Ismailescu and Kazemi, 2010), banks’ ratings (Williams et al., 2013), corporate ratings (Borensztein et al., 2013), and its real economy (Chen et al., 2013, 2016). For instance, William et al (2013) find that sovereign rating downgrades (upgrades) have strong effects on bank rating downgrades (upgrades) in emerging markets. Chen et al. (2016) show that a one-notch downgrade (upgrade) causes a decline (increase) of about 0.3 percent (0.6 percent) in re-rated countries’ average growth rates via the interest-rate and capital flows channel. This latter branch of the literature highlights how importance it is to understand the determinants of sovereign credit ratings.====In fact, of the above array studies and their implications for policymakers, no study has yet investigated the impact of coups d’état with regards to one of the financing sources for governments: the bond market. This is somewhat surprising giving that few political events attract as much as attention as coups d’état (Gassebner et al., 2016), and that, even almost three decades after the end of the cold war, coups d’état continue to be common around the world and often lead to political transitions and leadership changes (Leon, 2014). Given the paucity of evidence, it is also not surprising that we know even less about the channels by which the occurrence of coups d’état may affect the sovereign bond market.====The occurrence of a coup d’état in a country may have an impact on its sovereign bond market through a number of channels. First, coups may have adverse consequences for economic growth and investment. This is well demonstrated empirically by Barro (1991), Levine and Renelt (1992), Sala-i-Martin (1997), and Alesina et al. (1996). More recent research shows that coups cause economic downturns through the increase in military spending and institutional changes (Leon, 2014; Bove and Nistico, 2014; Meyersson, 2016). A recent example of coups’ impact includes Thailand's experience in 2014 where the period following the coup was characterized by weak domestic demand (including a decrease in spending and investment), a decrease in trade and tourism, and an increase in uncertainty (The Economist, 2014). The economic downtown in coup d’état countries may reduce their capacity to honor present and future debt obligations, thus worsening bond market access conditions. Second, a country's willingness to honor its debt obligations may also be negatively affected following a coup. Indeed, since a coup may likely result in a new administration, it may negatively affect the country's willingness to repay debt obligations undertaken by previous administrations. Such situations may arise when the new administration does not bear responsibility for previous debt contracts. Finally, the market might react accordingly as the result of irrational exuberance due to the obvious political turmoil coups d’état create. This may be so even if the coup d’état country's economic fundamentals remain sound.====In sum, whether and how coups d’état affect the sovereign bond market is an empirical issue. This paper differentiates from the literature on the financial effects of revolutions but rather contributes to the growing literature on the economic consequences of coups d’état (see for instance Barro, 1991; Levine and Renelt, 1992; Alesina et al., 1996; Leon, 2014; Masaki, 2016; Meyersson, 2016). It investigates in a first step whether the occurrence of coups d’état affects the cost of debt measured by sovereign credit ratings. In a second step, It tests whether countries that experienced coups d’état are likely to experience sovereign debt crises. Simple t-tests in Table 1 show that the level of sovereign credit rating is 3.94 notches higher in non-coup observations compared to coup observations. The probability of a debt crisis is also higher in the former group, with a different of 1 percent being statistically significant. In addition, the conditional probability of a debt crisis—that is the probability of a debt crisis conditional on the occurrence of a coup d’état—is 2 percent, compared to an unconditional probability of 1 percent. Building on these descriptive statistics, I employ a formal empirical analysis and rely on a monthly panel dataset covering 134 countries over the period 1990 to 2014. The period of the analysis is limited to the post-cold war period due to data availability constraints on sovereign ratings. A critical challenge in identifying the effect of coups on the cost of debt and debt crises is the well-known selection bias and endogeneity issue as both the cost of debt and coups may be driven by common factors. To overcome the issues, I employ an impact assessment methodology. A rather similar strategy is also used by Bussière et al. (2014) to analyze the impact of exchange rate appreciation on economic growth, by Forbes and Klein (2015) to examine the macroeconomic consequences of policy responses to crises, and by Forbes et al. (2015) to study the effectiveness of capital-flow management measures. Unlike these previous studies which rely strongly on the assumption of selection on observables, my empirical approach uses the entropy balancing method, a generalization of conventional matching methods proposed by Hainmueller (2012). Entropy balancing allows correcting for the self-selection that may result from observable characteristics by controlling for a large number of variables that may affect differently coup d’état and non-coup d’état countries. In particular, entropy balancing allows to achieve a high degree of covariate balance by using a reweighting scheme that directly incorporates covariate balance into a weight function that is applied to the sample units (Hainmueller, 2012). Practically, entropy balancing imposes a number of balance constraints that imply that the matching covariate distributions of coup d’état and non-coup d’état groups in the preprocessed data match exactly on all prespecified moments. Another crucial advantage of the methodology is that it allows to proper control for country and time dummies and therefore rolling out unobservable factors at country and time levels. Using the entropy balancing, I compare the level of a sovereign debt risk or debt crises in coup d’état and non-coup d’état countries that are as similar as possible in terms of observable characteristics, after purging for unobservable factors. To ensure that my finding is not the result of a statistical artifact, I also make use of falsification tests. In the falsification tests, I replace the true coups d’état dates with fake dates and re-estimate the impact of coups d’état based on these fake dates.====To anticipate my main results, I find that the occurrence of coups d’état significantly reduces sovereign credit ratings in coup d’état countries compared to non-coup d’état countries. On average, a country experiences a half-notch reduction of its sovereign debt rating following a coup d’état. Such a reduction represents a change in outlook from positive to negative. I demonstrate that this finding is not sensitive to alternative specifications of the entropy balancing, potential omitted variables bias, or the use of falsification tests. Moreover,====I show that the impact of coups d’état on sovereign debt ratings varies depending on the political regime, the types of coups d’état, and the quality of the rating in the coup d’état country. The magnitude of the effect of coups is more pronounced in autocratic regimes than in democratic regimes because coups are more likely to happen in autocracies than in democracies; and even when they do happen in democracies, they are less likely to succeed. I also find that successful coups, attempted coups, and plotted coups have negative effects on ratings, while alleged coups do not have any statistically significant effect. The magnitude of the impact of successful coups is more important than that of attempted or plotted coups. The findings also suggest that coup events negatively affect debt cost only in speculative rating grade countries but not in investment rating grade countries as the latter group of countries may have stronger institutions in place and also solid and less volatile macroeconomic fundamentals. Going further in the analysis, I provide additional evidence that coups d’état increase the probability of sovereign defaults. Once a coup occurs, a country's likelihood of entering a sovereign crisis increases by 1.5 percentage points. Finally, I provide suggestive evidence that the induced drop in the real economic growth, the changes in the willingness function to honor contracts (proxied by an indicator of “law and order”) and irrational exuberance (proxied by stock price volatility and bank z-score) are potential transmission channels through which the occurrence of coups d’état affect sovereign debt risk.====The next section presents the entropy balancing methodology. Section 3 details the data and presents some descriptive statistics. Section 4 reports the empirical findings of the effect of coups on debt cost and sovereign debt crises.

We find that households living in localities exposed to the war have been subsequently more likely to be poor than non-exposed households. ==== estimations, controlling for time-varying heterogeneity at the province level, confirm the positive impact of violence exposure on household poverty. We investigate some of the potential mechanisms at play in the violence – poverty nexus, and the role of violence exposure in household poverty dynamics over time. Our results notably suggest that the destruction of physical capital, as well as a shift of exposed households out of non-farm activities, shape poverty dynamics and lower their chances of durably remaining out of poverty.","From 1946 to 2012, the world witnessed more than 250 civil wars (Simon Fraser University, 2013). After a peak following the end of the Cold War and a decline thereafter, the global number of conflicts has increased again since 2010. Civil wars can affect outcomes as varied as poverty, institutions, human capital, and economic growth, which also determine the risk of conflict reoccurrence. Improving knowledge on the various consequences of wars and on their persistence over time is thus a key research challenge to enlighten post-conflict policy making and the management of conflict risk.====The Burundi Civil War started in 1993, following the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the first democratically elected president, three months after he came to power. This triggered brutal attacks by Hutu groups, followed by violent retaliation from the Tutsi-dominated army. Starting in the Northwest, violence soon spread toward the northeastern, central, and southern provinces. From 1993 to 2005, the whole country was affected, though at different degrees and periods (United Nations, 1996, Chrétien, Mukuri, 2002). The conflict eventually left over 300,000 Burundians dead, for a population of around 5.8 million in 1993 (Ngaruko and Nkurunziza, 2000).====We adopt a micro-level approach to analyze the legacy of violence on household poverty dynamics in Burundi. While a strand of economic research documents the poverty impact of a range of shocks (e.g. weather- or trade-related) and the socioeconomic characteristics that move individuals and households into and out of poverty, there is little evidence on the impact of violent events on long-term poverty (Justino and Verwimp, 2013). This is mostly due to the lack of micro-level panel data allowing to track households over time in violent contexts. We exploit a three-wave panel dataset in which we observe households in 1998, 2007, and 2012. We match these household-level data with information on violence, which is available at the locality level and covers the whole period of war. To do so, we aggregate yearly exposure data over two subperiods: [1993,1998] and [1999,2007], no violence being observed after 2007. The evolution of household poverty over time can thus be related to the time-varying intensity of violence in the locality. Based on these data, we contribute to the literature on the micro-level consequences of civil wars through three empirical exercises.====First, we analyze in a panel setting how changes in locality-level violence from one subperiod to the other translate into variations in household poverty over time. The richness of the data allows us to account for household fixed effects, as well as for national and subnational trends. We find a positive relationship between exposure to violence and poverty, which we argue reveals causality. This is notably consistent with cross-sectional evidence from Serneels and Verpoorten, 2015 that households exposed to civil war and genocide in Rwanda had significantly lower consumption than non-exposed households six years after the end of the violence.====The second part of our empirical analysis relies on the panel dimension of the data to document some of the mechanisms at play in the violence – poverty nexus. The literature on the micro-level consequences of civil wars emphasizes four main channels through which violence exposure is expected to affect poverty.==== ====, war-induced deaths, injuries, and disabilities affect households’ demographic structure and labor endowment. In some cases, direct excess mortality has notably been shown to impact young men (De Walque, 2006, De Walque and Verwimp, 2010), which could result in a shrinking ratio of net producers to net consumers among households, and in higher poverty. ====, conflict causes the loss or destruction of productive assets such as land and cattle (Brück, 2001, González and Lopez, 2007, Shemyakina, 2011).==== This impedes important sources of households’ livelihood and can critically affect their productive capacity. The vulnerability to such loss is likely to depend on households’ asset endowment, some assets being more easily looted than others (Bundervoet, 2010, Justino, 2012, Martin-Shields, Stojetz, 2019). ====, violence disrupts the accumulation of human capital: exposure to civil wars has been shown to impede children’s nutritional status, health, and schooling outcomes.==== All these effects might have long-run consequences on income (Alderman, Hoddinott, Kinsey, 2006, Ichino and Winter-Ebmer, 2004, Islam, Ouch, Smyth, Wang, 2016, Smith, 2009). ====, the literature suggests that conflicts influence various dimensions of social capital, such as trust and altruistic attitudes. Though the nature of this influence is uncertain, it is likely that war-induced changes in social capital also affect poverty.====We seek to uncover some of the mechanisms at play in the violence – poverty nexus in Burundi. In particular, we show that violence affects the demographic structure of exposed households, as well as their physical capital and economic activities. We notably find a negative effect of violence exposure on cattle ownership, and evidence of a war-induced shift of exposed households toward subsistence farming. With the advantage of being based on household fixed effect specifications, these results are consistent with the evidence from other conflicts provided by the literature – in particular, Brück (2001) on Mozambique and Annan et al., 2006 on Uganda – and in line with the available qualitative evidence on Burundi. The impact of violence on human capital, which is the object of a very rich literature (see in particular Bundervoet et al., 2009 in the case of Burundi), is left aside, while the social capital channel cannot be dealt with based on our data.====The third part of the analysis investigates how violence shapes households’ poverty dynamics over time. While very few databases cover the same households over multiple waves in a poor, conflict-ridden setting, the panel at hand allows us to document how violence exposure relates to households’ long-run poverty status. In particular, we underline a negative correlation between violence exposure and the likelihood that a household remains non-poor over the whole period of observation. Although this result emanates from a weaker specification (as household fixed effects and time trends cannot be accounted for), it is highly consistent with the observed war-induced destruction of assets, which is likely to primarily affect non-poor households. It is also in line with the results of Justino and Verwimp, 2013 which suggest that non-poor households were the most affected by exposure to violence in Rwanda, and that initially better-off provinces suffered disproportionately from the destruction of productive factors.====The following section describes the data and provides an overview of poverty in Burundi over the period of analysis. In Section 3, we analyze the link between violence exposure and household poverty, and discuss the threats to our empirical approach. Section 4 investigates some of the potential mechanisms at work. Section 5 explores the relationship between violence exposure and the dynamics of poverty, and Section 6 concludes.",Violence exposure and poverty: Evidence from the Burundi civil war,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718304621,8 May 2020,2020,Research Article,167.0

Distinguishing between civilian and military victims, we show that violence against civilians drives the negative effect. Next, we examine different mediating mechanisms including forced migration and demographic selection, ethnic composition, physical capital damage, post-conflict reconstruction, and labor market conditions. Our results support the hypothesis that violence affects voting through a “moral” dis-utility from showing allegiance to politics and the society by casting a vote. Using survey data, we show that respondents in more affected municipalities report lower generalized trust, trust in institutions, and voting.","Formal institutions and informal norms such as civic capital and trust between market participants contribute crucially to economic development (Guiso, Sapienza, Zingales, 2011, Algan, Cahuc, 2010). The establishment of institutions and democratic participation in the aftermath of a civil war is vital for the reconstruction and development of war-torn economies and societies. Elections, in particular, can be decisive for the achievement of peaceful resolutions to political controversies and collective decision making (Korth, 2011). A growing literature shows that the experience of violence may undermine social capital, trust, preferences for market participation, and political preferences (Voors, Nillesen, Verwimp, Bulte, Lensink, Van Soest, 2012, Rohner, Thoenig, Zilibotti, 2013). Political participation and institutional representation ultimately determine the allocation of public and private resources (Miguel and Roland, 2011). It is therefore important to understand how voting behavior differs for individuals who were more affected by violence than others. In particular, does the intensity of violence against civilians in a civil conflict lead to differential political participation among victims?====This paper provides original evidence of a long-lasting negative relationship between violence against civilians and voter turnout. Further, we investigate potential underlying mechanisms including demographic selection, migration, ethnic polarization, reconstruction, labor market conditions, and political competition. Our results are consistent with a framework à la Riker and Ordeshook (1968) in which voters gain utility (a “warm-glow”) by asserting partisanship and demonstrating allegiance to the political system. In particular, our results suggest that victims that suffered higher conflict brutality in terms of civilian losses experience disutility from political participation. Using data from local and central democratic elections and war casualties in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH) municipalities, we estimate that a one standard deviation increase in civilian casualties, 1.24% of the pre-war population, reduces turnout by up to 4.2 percentage points. With an average turnout of 55–60% and casualties reaching up to 7%, the effect is large in magnitude and statistically significant at conventional levels for every election in our data.==== We find that the impact persists over twenty years after the conflict resolution.====The expected direction in which exposure to violence may affect voter turnout through a change in behavior and preferences is ambiguous. On one hand, the literature argues that war may foster cooperation by encouraging neighbors to organize common defense, attack, and coping strategies against external aggressors. According to this hypothesis, Bellows and Miguel (2009) find that conflict in Sierra Leone increased engagement in community meetings and self-reported political involvement. Blattman (2009) shows a higher political engagement among former abducted combatants in Uganda. He suggests that former soldiers experienced a post-traumatic psychological growth which increased their participation in civic life. Voors et al. (2012) estimate higher levels of in-group altruism among individuals in Burundi whose villages directly experienced high levels of violence. On the other hand, Cassar et al. (2013) argue that experiencing violence during the Tajik civil war, characterized by intra-group fighting, led to decreased levels of trust and preferences for market participation. War violence may thus erode social capital and participation to the political life if individuals were attacked by members of their own community. In a meta-analysis on conflict and cooperation, Bauer et al. (2016) conclude that individuals experiencing violence generally develop pro-social preferences toward members of the same community (“in-group”), while there is not much evidence in the literature on preferences towards “out-group” members.====Our study addresses the case of an ethnic civil conflict in which victims were attacked by members of their own social community and are then called to partake in the same political system as their aggressors, which emphasizes wartime ethnic divisions. We expect that inter-group aggression and the out-group dimension of civic participation would induce a negative relationship between violence and voter turnout. In particular, our study contributes to the existing literature in two ways: (i) we estimate that violence ==== led to a persistent decrease in voting behavior and (ii) we show that this effect can be interpreted as a disruption of trust in institutions and inter-personal relations. The expression of a vote for parties that are strictly associated with war dividends brings agents a disutility that outweighs the benefits of voting, the higher the violence.====Azam and Hoeffler (2002) and Kalyvas et al. (2006) assert that perpetrators can intentionally use violence against civilians with the strategic purpose of undermining the sense of society and disrupting the social fabric. Our study introduces a crucial distinction between civilian and military war casualties, which helps investigating and supporting this hypothesis. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find that lower turnout and mistrust in institutions arose specifically from violence towards civilians.==== In contrast, higher exposure in terms of military casualties had no statistically significant relationship with post-war turnout rates nor social capital measures.==== The presence of pre-war turnout data allows us to investigate selective targeting of politically active communities. We show that politically active municipalities were more likely to experience high levels of violence during the war.====We address alternative mechanisms through which conflict may affect voting behavior, such as demographic selection, migration, ethnic composition, labor market conditions, physical capital damage, and post-conflict reconstruction.====Our analysis provides evidence in favor of the hypothesis that violence against civilians had a negative effect on turnout through the “warm glow” of voting. To shed more light on this channel, we use a nationally representative individual-level survey on social and political preferences (EBRD, 2006). The survey allows us to control for recalled trust and political engagement before the war. We find that respondents in municipalities exposed to intensive violence towards civilians report a lower propensity to vote, to trust other people, and to trust political and economic institutions such as the presidency, the cabinet of ministers, the parliament, political parties, the court, military forces, the police, and the financial system. The results suggest that the mechanism linking exposure to violence towards civilians and voting lies in the depletion of social preferences, trust in institutions, and interpersonal ties.====A challenge to the estimation of the causal effect of war violence arises from the fact that municipalities with a higher share of casualties may have been specifically targeted because of their geographical, economic, social, or political importance or weakness. Communities with higher civic capital may be more efficient in organizing defense and attack. A cross-sectional correlation of voter turnout and the intensity of violence against civilians may reflect other municipality characteristics such as, for example, lower pre-war social capital: this would lead to an overestimation of the effect of violence on turnout. Additionally, the consequences of war extend to a broad range of economic, demographic, social, and political outcomes that may correlate with political preferences and behavior, and may cause omitted variable bias. To tackle the concern of endogeneity, we adopt several empirical strategies. One advantage of the Bosnian context is that the country had its first free and democratic elections before the outbreak of the war. This allows us to follow a difference-in-differences strategy. We take the first difference between post-war and pre-war turnout rates and regress it on the intensity of violence towards civilians from the same municipality of origin. Another advantage is that the same parties that emerged shortly before the war still define the political scene nowadays. This increases the comparability between pre and post-conflict political participation. The absence of multiple democratic elections before the war, however, impedes a test for pre-conflict parallel trends. For this reason, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Next, we additionally assess the validity of our findings through alternative empirical specifications. We show that our estimates are robust to the inclusion of pre and post-war geographical, demographic, and economic municipality characteristics that the literature identifies as important determinants of conflict risk (Novta, 2016, Weidmann, 2011, Kalyvas, Sambanis, 2005). Similar to Bellows and Miguel (2009), we investigate heterogeneous effects for voters who were too young to be directly targeted in the war, compared to older cohorts. We do not find any statistically significant difference, which speaks against the hypothesis of selective victimization of politically (in)active individuals. Finally, we instrument variation in conflict intensity with measures of terrain ruggedness. The literature suggests that mountainous environments are conducive to conflict risk because they facilitate sheltering and attack in the adjacent valleys (Kalyvas and Sambanis, 2005). All our estimation specifications confirm that the intensity of violence towards civilians decreases voter turnout.====A study very related to ours is the work by Hadzic et al. (2017). They investigate the impact of violence on post-war ethnic vote shares in BiH, applying a similar empirical approach. The focus of the two studies is on different outcomes. While Hadzic et al. (2017) investigate the impact of conflict on ethnic voting (and inter-ethnic trust), our paper analyses the impact on electoral turnout. Hadzic et al. (2017) find that exposure to violence increases post-war vote shares for ethnic parties. Using individual-level survey data, they also find that individuals are less likely to trust other ethnicities in high-violence communities and are more likely to retreat into their ethnic community. We find that violence exposure decreases turnout, and our individual-level survey analysis shows lower levels of trust in public institutions and lower propensities to vote. We believe that the findings of the two studies are supplementary and mutually reinforcing. One interpretation of these joint results is that moderate voters may have become discouraged to participate politically after the war, thus lowering turnout rates and leaving a higher relative participation among ethnic voters.==== This could explain the co-existence of lower turnout rates and higher vote shares for ethnic parties.",Does violence against civilians depress voter turnout?

Unique panel data from rural China identifies lineage networks (ancestral hall and genealogy) and provides detailed information on income and migration experiences. Our key finding is that lineage networks increase migration for all social groups by lowering costs, and this pattern is more salient for the poor. Consequently, this population accumulates greater ","China has had impressive economic growth over the past 30 years, with a commensurate decrease in the level of poverty. There is mounting concern, however, that increases in inequality, which have accompanied that growth, may suggest that many are not sharing in the fruits of development. Since the onset of economic reform in the early 1980s, rural-urban migration had increased annually nearly 6%, while the Gini coefficient in rural China rose correspondingly from 0.35 in 1986 to 0.44 in 2008 (see Appendix Figure A1). This raises an additional concern that such a high level of migrant growth may lead to the expansion of inequality in rural China.====A broad literature has amply demonstrated the effects of migration on inequality in developing countries and, in China, has also found a causal relationship between migration and inequality increases (Bang, Mitra, & Wunnava, 2016; Barham & Boucher, 1998; Beyene, 2014; Howell, 2017; McKenzie & Rapoport, 2007; Shen, Docquier, & Rapoport, 2010; Zhao, 2003). However, it says little about what factors might mitigate the expansion of inequality during periods of strong migrant growth. An informal institution, social networks, has the potential to either mitigate or exacerbate inequality during periods of migrant growth. Here, we ask the question: In present-day China can social networks successfully mitigate rising inequality during the periods of sustained migrant growth through their role in fostering migration for the relatively poor?====While the majority of social network research has considered India, where castes are the primary networks, or parts of Africa, where ethnic groups are the primary networks, few works have focused on networks in China. China is an important place to study the operation of social networks because of its size, poverty, and large rural population. In rural China, where the reach of formal institutions is often short, social networks are generally organized around surname lineage groups, which may produce different outcomes than networks common to other parts of the world. As an informal solidarity organization, lineage groups levy taxes, control the public infrastructure, and allocate the important public resources in rural areas (Lu & Tao, 2017; Padró i Miquel, Qian, Xu, & Yao, 2018; Shen & Yao, 2008; Tsai, 2007; Xu & Yao, 2015). Despite their central role in village governance, relatively little is known about how well lineage networks push rural-urban migration for all villagers, how (or whether) they are accountable to the poor, and how these networks operate in mitigating the rising inequality that accompanies migrant growth.====In this paper, we use the persistent lineage organizations in rural China to study the impact of lineage networks on rural-urban migration and income inequality at origin. As Watson (1982) recorded, it is common to find villages with strong lineage groups in present-day China, where a large population of residents reside within geographical proximity and descend from the same (or a few of the same) patrilineal ancestors and share the same surname. Bound up in immediate kinship ties, lineages keep a record of a family tree, or genealogy book, which represents the structure of the surname lineage that is traceable from the common unilinear ancestry. It might also construct an ancestral hall temple, which is used to hold regularly organized collective rituals and activities (ceremonies, festivals, and celebrations). These ancestral hall activities reinforce group identity and solidarity, as well as members’ sense of obligation. Moreover, social sanctions are easier to impose in a lineage group with an ancestral hall or genealogy book. For example, they could involve reducing or excluding violators from ancestral hall activities, or even removal from the lineage's family tree. Such internal disciplining mechanisms within a well-organized lineage group, consistent with recent evidence on within-lineage-group cohesiveness obtained by Xu and Yao (2015), are posited to increase superior social cohesiveness and sustain enhanced cooperation.====We hypothesize that lineage networks, when they are primarily formed by immediate kinship and superior social cohesion, tend to help the poor relatively more than the rich, because the poor can get help from the rich, but it is hard for the rich to get help from the poor. In the case of migration, the poor can participate in migration due to the help extended by lineage networks, where migration costs are often low, thereby decreasing income inequality within the migrants’ home village. To measure the lineage networks, we have conducted one of the first comprehensive lists of lineage structures and their ancestral halls and genealogies across villages in rural China. In our context, the key independent variable of interest is a dummy variable indicating whether a village maintained an ancestral hall (AH) or kept records of lineage genealogy (GE) since the beginning of the observed data period.====The AH or GE in a village may, however, be correlated with omitted variables that influence migration and inequality through other channels. We use two strategies to alleviate this concern. First, we observe the timing of building AHs and restrict the lineage sample period for each AH to be prior to the economic reforms in 1978, documenting that the presence of AHs are uncorrelated with the level of current migration or income factors. Second, we use measures of Qing dynasty natural disasters from historical records provided by Chen (2007) as an instrument for the presence of AHs or GEs. ==== However, historical disasters may have been a product of historical migration or environmental factors that themselves affect current migration and income. To partially address such concern, we include a wide array of variables measuring historical population and land size, local climate, and geographic characteristics, as well as village infrastructure projects, all of which might correlate with historical natural disasters and current migration and income of interest. We also exclude earthquakes and other unusual natural disasters, because such disruptions might have been persistent and hard to predict until recently.====Our empirical results show that in villages associated with AHs or GEs, there is a greater migration probability for all households, and this pattern is more salient for the poor. We also show that income inequality is significantly lower in places with AHs or GEs. We interpret these results as evidence that the association between the lineage networks and income inequality is stronger when rural-to-urban migration policy appears to be more available. We also show that it is increased access to migration opportunity for the poor, rather than variation in pro-poor transfers or donations, that has led to lower inequality within villages.====Our findings show that migrant networks across lineage groups may have very different implications than networks across friendship, shared community origin, or ethnic groups as documented in other contexts across the world. First, migrant networks in most of the literature are usually approximated by the size of lagged origin migration (McKenzie & Rapoport, 2010; Munshi, 2003; Zhang & Li, 2003; Zhao, 2003). Measurement errors in these migrant networks can be much larger than in lineage networks when we use the lineage size or its cohesiveness. Moreover, the size of lagged origin migration can provide information about the scale of migrant networks but may not capture a network's social power and cohesiveness. Measures of social cohesiveness provided by lineage AHs and GEs inform us about the intensity of within-lineage social activities and members’ sense of belonging. In addition, there can be more social sanctions in lineage-wide migrant networks than in migrant networks with ties of friendship or shared village origin. This hypothesis is in the spirit of Xu and Yao (2015), who postulate that the internal disciplining mechanisms within lineage groups can increase their social cohesiveness and force them to contribute their respective shares to public infrastructure projects. We add to this basic insight—generally true for all lineage groups—that there is added weight for lineages with AHs or GEs, because their links and internal disciplining mechanisms are posited to be stronger than those of other networks. While it is possible that our findings are very specific to the Chinese context, we believe our findings are relevant for broader types of societies. Lineages and extended families play an important economic and political role in other parts of the world (see, for example, Acemoglu, Reed, & Robinson, 2014 for the case of Sierra Leone; Cruz, Labonne, & Querubin, 2018 for the case of Philippines).====We contribute to a large empirical literature on the composition of networks in terms of income and its distribution by providing empirical evidence for the case of China on how income inequality that accompanies migration policy varies with lineage networks (Munshi & Rosenzweig, 2009; 2016). ==== Closely related to our paper is the work by McKenzie and Rapoport (2007), who find that income dispersion is lower in villages associated with more prevalent migration networks; this has played a key role in providing lower migration costs to the lower class of the wealth distribution for the case of migration from Mexico to the United States. Similarly, a recent theoretical paper by Gagnon and Goyal (2017) illustrates that social networks interact with markets to lower or raise inequality, depending on whether market actions and network exchange are substitutes or complements. In our context, poor households will increase their geographic mobility with the support of a lineage network at their original village. In so doing, they increase income gained by their migrants and lower income inequality at origin. We also find that shifts in migration policy over the years have enhanced the payoffs to the poor who originally benefit more from their network.====In addition, this work also extends the growing literature on the role that informal institutions such as lineage networks can play in village governance and policy in developing countries. The evidence that the poor could benefit more from the existence of a network or an increase in its size shows that informal institutions could enhance rather than act as barriers to reducing inequality in rural Chinese villages. The decrease in income inequality produced by a lineage network, identified in this work, is not a result of pro-poor income redistribution, but instead a human investment; it is the result of increased access to opportunities for the poor in the form of a higher migration propensity. This point is similar to that of McKenzie and Rapoport (2010), who examine the effect of networks on the pattern of migration from Mexico to the United states and argue that in communities with stronger networks, those who migrate are less skilled or educated than those who remain. As a consequence, the lineage networks in rural Chinese villages may be able to help carry out a set of pro-poor policies by stimulating the growth of economic opportunities.====Finally, we build on previous work that studies how social networks may reduce migration costs and provide access to financing for migration among network members, as well as job information and opportunities at the destination to network members (Dolfin & Genicot, 2010; Munshi, 2003; Munshi & Rosenzweig, 2009; Zhang & Li, 2003; Zhao, 2003). More recently, Munshi and Rosebzweig (2016) and Morten (2019) study, respectively, how insurance networks affect the choice of migration and the joint determination of migration and insurance networks in India. We contribute to this literature by studying these questions in the context of migrant networks across different types of groups.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly present the institutional background of lineage groups in rural China and the role played by lineages on migration. In Section 3 we discuss the survey data we collected as well as measures of lineage networks and outcome variables and present some basic descriptive evidence. Section 4 examines the relationship between migration and inequality. In Section 5 we provide the econometric design and report our main results, and in Section 6 we present robustness checks. Section 7 concludes.","Lineage networks, urban migration and income inequality: Evidence from rural China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718305432,7 May 2020,2020,Research Article,169.0

The actual limitations on economic activity from this failure may depend on whether people believe the system is unfair, and how well governing institutions safeguard fair-play. In this paper, I study whether unfair wealth inequality is correlated with beliefs about fairness, and whether good governance can be a substitute in belief formations for decreases in unfair inequality. I find a that people in countries with recent increases in unfair wealth inequality are less likely to believe that inequality is due to fair processes. This relationship holds when“fair” determinants of inequality include effort, as well as moral and meritocratic components. The relationship is strongest in countries with poor quality governance. In countries with high quality governance, people appear to be more tolerant of unfair inequality, as it is only weakly reflected in their beliefs about process fairness.","Beliefs about inequality do not always reflect economists’ estimates (Chambers, Swan, Heesacker, 2014, Gasparini, Cruces, 2013, Gimpelson, Treisman, 2018, Norton, Ariely, 2011, Verme, Milanovic, Al-Shawarby, El Tawila, Gadallah, A. El-Majeed, 2014). Beliefs about determinants of inequality can also be inaccurate. In particular, people’s beliefs about whether hard work and ambition are critical for economic success do not necessarily correlate well with the true contribution from these factors (Brunori, 2017). It is important to understand what drives inaccuracy in these beliefs because they can impact economic decision-making and attitudes towards redistribution (Alesina, Giuliano, 2011, Fogli, Veldkamp, 2011, Fernández, 2013). My main contribution is to investigate the hypothesis that institutional quality interacts with experience to influence beliefs. I look specifically at beliefs about whether determinants of economic outcomes are fair. If a person believes that hard work determines outcomes, is that because they have experience of hard work determining outcomes, or because they live in a place where formal institutions function properly?====Beliefs about whether determinants of inequality are fair are important for economic decision making. For example, beliefs about inequality and fairness can affect voter turnout (Birch, 2010) as well as attitudes toward redistribution (Eisenkopf, Fischbacher, Föllmi-Heusi, 2013, Durante, Putterman, Van der Weele, 2014, Gründler, Köllner, 2017). In the transition region, perceptions of process fairness, especially fairness in government, have been shown to be correlated with life satisfaction (Djankov et al., 2016). Meanwhile, blaming failure on an unfair system can lead to dramatically different equilibrium effort levels than if one believes effort is largely rewarded (Alesina et al., 2012). If people do not believe they can get rewarded for hard work and ability, there may be little incentive for people to “buy into the system”, for example by investing in human capital or building a business. This under-investment can in turn impact growth (Marrero and Rodríguez, 2013). In sum, beliefs about fairness of determinants of economic outcomes are valuable to study because they can impact consequential economic decisions.====There are many reasons why beliefs about determinants of inequality may not coincide with what actually determines inequality. Beliefs about what makes people rich or poor can be heavily influenced by social norms and personal values (Alesina and Angeletos, 2005). Individuals may also hold onto inaccurate beliefs as a way to protect their identity or view of themselves (Bénabou and Tirole, 2011). Alternatively, beliefs about what determines inequality may be biased by the policies and institutions to which individuals are exposed during their life (Hunt, 1996, Alesina, Giuliano, 2015, Wildavsky, 1987). According to this hypothesis, institutional quality interacts with how people experience determinants of inequality in a way that changes their perception of their experience (Piketty, 1995, Bénabou, 2008).====There are two ways in which the interaction between institutions and determinants of inequality can impact beliefs. First, individuals can learn about institutional quality directly. What they learn will either reinforce or undermine the judgments they form as a result of their own experiences with what determines economic success (Bénabou, 2008).==== For example, Di Tella et al. (2007) show that improving land titling among squatters in Brazil increased the squatters’ beliefs about the value of self-reliance for success. As squatters, these people already had dominion and perceived ownership over the land before the intervention. So it was not ownership per se that changed their views, but the interaction of formal recognition from the state with their life experience. Thus, direct contact with institutions can interact with experience to influence beliefs about determinants of economic success.====Second, well-functioning formal institutions can act like an insurance policy, such that the beliefs people hold about ex ante inequality will be influenced by their ex post ability to compensate for it, using the available formal institutions. For example, labor market discrimination is a nearly universal ==== source of ex ante inequality. In countries with stronger rule of law, people have higher chances of successfully challenging labor market discrimination ex post. Therefore, even if the discrimination does not occur, the existence of a solution to address it can generate a better opinion of the economic system overall (e.g. whether effort pays, independent of one’s circumstances).==== Thus, people may view the same reality in a different light depending on the formal institutions that frame the situation.====I will test the central hypothesis for this study using two different definitions of fairness.==== One definition I consider is from Rawls (1971), Roemer (1998) and van de Gaer (1993). It combines what are known as the Principles of Compensation and Reward. This framework classifies sources of inequality based on whether or not they are something an individual can control, and for which they take responsibility. Cappelen et al. (2010) refer to this definition of fair as “choice egalitarian”. The consensus in this strand of literature is that inequality due to responsibility factors, such as effort, is justified (Principle of Reward). Correspondingly, inequality due to circumstances over which one has no control, is not (Principle of Compensation).====On the other hand, Nozick (1973) contends that for an outcome to be considered fair, it must also be just. Labelling an outcome as fair therefore requires “knowing that it is unpolluted by extortion, robbery, slavery, and so on.” Thus, the second definition encompasses the first, and also classifies inequality that stems from moral behavior, such as obeying the law, as fair. Inequality that stems from privilege or dishonest behavior is classified as unfair. This approach is consistent with the meritocratic definition from Sen et al. (2000) and with Konow (2000)’s Accountability Principle – inequality is fair if people get what they deserve (and deserve what they get) based on their choices and actions (Alesina and Angeletos, 2005). Individual endowments from birth that have genetic components, such as intelligence, would also be considered fair determinants of inequality in the meritocratic sense, but not necessarily according to the Principle of Compensation. This second definition is thus a broader definition than the first.====It is valuable to consider both conventions. The first definition is strictly consistent with my measure of unfair processes, so it makes more sense to use when checking for inaccurate beliefs. The second is likely more intuitive for respondents, who may aggregate both poor choices as well as circumstances at birth when they think about fair and unfair determinants of inequality.====To capture objectively unfair processes empirically, I use a measure based on the concept of inequality of opportunity (Roemer, 1998). Inequality in the distribution of any economic outcome can be thought of as resulting from a combination of fair and unfair processes. The class of estimator that I use attempts to isolate this unfair portion by focusing on the inequality that can be attributed to circumstances beyond a person’s control, such as place of birth and parental background (Bourguignon et al., 2007). The idea is that circumstances at birth should not impact an individual’s outcomes. Nonetheless, these factors have been shown to heavily influence outcomes for minority or other disadvantaged groups (Altonji, Blank, 1999, Bertrand, Mullainathan, 2004, Blau, Kahn, 2000). Inequality of opportunity is thus a useful conceptual framework for a measure of unfair inequality in an economy.====Providing these estimates of changes in unfair inequality over time is a second contribution of this paper. I construct estimates for a set of 35 countries in 2010 and 34 countries in 2016. This is important to the literature. Estimates of changes in unfair inequality are rare since collection of sufficient circumstance data is a relatively new effort, especially in large cross country datasets.====For empirical estimates of institutional quality, I use the governance measure from the Worldwide Governance Indicator project. This database includes country-level assessments of formal institutions that directly support the economy: government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption. These institutions should support and protect equal opportunity because, where they are effective, they strengthen the link between effort and outcomes. Formal governing institutions responsible for protecting personal property and limiting gains to corrupt behaviour are particularly relevant.====Unlike past work on this issue (e.g., Denisova et al., 2009), I focus on changes in unfair inequality, rather than levels. Looking at changes gives better insight into whether beliefs about process fairness are updated with experience. If levels of unfair inequality are correlated with beliefs about the determinants of inequality, this can reflect persistence of high levels of unfair inequality, persistent intergenerational beliefs or both. On the other hand, if changes in unfair inequality are correlated with beliefs now, then it suggests that people are updating based on experience. Furthermore, differences in the correlation by institutional quality provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that institutions are important for belief formation. Lastly, I compare results on unfair inequality with results on overall income inequality.====My work also builds on a study by Abras et al. (2013), who also investigate the link between beliefs about fairness and unfair inequality. They find that, in 2006, people are likely to attribute success to an unfair process when inequality of opportunity for jobs is high. My work builds on this by using multiple time periods and levels of institutional quality. I also use wealth instead of jobs for the measure of unfair inequality, a longer-term measure of success, and test two measures of fairness. I thus provide a more in-depth analysis of how unfair inequality is reflected in people’s attitudes.====This study adds to the evidence on the interaction between culture and institutions. Beliefs about the processes behind poverty and corresponding attitudes towards work are common themes in studies on the role of culture in economics (see Alesina and Giuliano, 2015 for a review). Culture, as we study it in economics, can be defined as “a set of beliefs, values and preferences, capable of affecting behavior, that are socially... transmitted and that are shared by some subset of society” (Mokyr, 2016, p.8). I follow this convention from Alesina and Giuliano (2015) and Mokyr (2016), and distinguish between formal institutions and culture.====My paper is also additional to a study recently published in this journal on determinants of governmental redistribution and the role of perceptions (Gründler and Köllner, 2017). Gründler and Köllner (2017) look at how beliefs may influence redistribution, taking institutions into account. In effect, they ask how beliefs impact policy outcomes. In contrast, I look at belief formation, and how this may be influenced by people’s experiences. My work is thus in the spirit of Bowles (1998) and Piketty (1995), while Gründler and Köllner (2017) focus on the Meltzer-Richard hypothesis (Meltzer and Richard, 1981). Lastly, our two papers do share a common concern for perceived versus actual inequality, but Gründler and Köllner (2017) consider beliefs about overall income inequality, while I consider only the unfair portion of overall inequality. It is important to consider fair and unfair inequality separately, as they likely to have distinct impact on macro-level outcomes such a redistribution and growth (Marrero and Rodríguez, 2013).====I find that my measure for unfair inequality is negatively correlated with beliefs that processes behind inequality are fair, but that the definition of “fair” matters. Survey respondents seem to see process fairness in a broader sense than the mechanics of the objective measurement would indicate. Also, institutional quality matters. The interaction between changes in unfair inequality and level of governance is positive and significant. Thus, if governance is at the level of Central Europe or above, it is more likely that good governance can substitute for reductions in unfair inequality in motivating positive beliefs about success. On the other hand, where governance is at the level of Central Asia, increases in unfair inequality exhibit a negative and statistically significant effect on beliefs that success is fair. In comparison, I find that good governance is not a good substitute in belief formation for higher levels of or changes in overall income equality.====The paper proceeds as follows. First, I describe the methodology used to approximate unfair inequality and describe the empirical specification for the main estimation. Second, I introduce the data and present variable definitions. This is followed by the results and a conclusion.","Unfair inequality, governance and individual beliefs",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300123,30 March 2020,2020,Research Article,170.0

The campaign also improved the productivity of companies with strong connections. The results are consistent with a model in which favor exchanges between firms and the government divert resources away from production in a corrupt environment. These findings highlight a self-serving, and sometimes corrupt, motive of corporate donation, and imply that the campaign is effective in curbing corrupt collusion between companies and government officials. Moreover, they give empirical support to the negative efficiency implications of ====.","In China, corporate donations account for almost 70% of all domestic charitable donations. This statistic stands in great contrast with the less than 10% in the US, 25% in Europe, and 49% in Japan.==== Approximately 40% of Chinese donations go through China’s charity foundations, the financial transparency of which is known to be low.==== It is a puzzling phenomenon that many Chinese companies still donate despite the low transparency. More puzzlingly, companies that make zero or negative profits also donate a large share of their revenue annually (Fig. 1).====These observations about Chinese corporate philanthropy raise the general question of why firms donate. While existing literature often focuses on firms’ philanthropic intentions and their incentives to build likable images among consumers and other stakeholders (Porter, Kramer, 2002, Godfrey, 2005, Benabou, Tirole, 2009), these theories on firms’ philanthropic donations seem inadequate to explain why Chinese firms are still willing to donate despite the low financial accountability of the organizations receiving their donations. Moreover, these theories cannot explain why firms in China have a higher tendency to make charitable givings (relative to individuals) compared to firms in more developed economies.====In this study, we attempt to empirically test another important rationale for firms to make charitable donations; that is, in countries where government officials play a crucial role in allocating resources across firms, charitable donations may be an instrument that firms use to engage in reciprocal favor exchanges with government officials. Although this role of charitable giving as a means of extracting policy favors exists widely in anecdotes, it has rarely been explored in empirical research until recently (Bertrand et al. (2018) and Bertrand et al. (2019) are the two exceptions).====In this study, we take advantage of a massive anti-corruption campaign conducted by the Chinese government in 2013 to examine the nature of Chinese corporate donations and provide empirical support for this rent-seeking motive of corporate philanthropy. The 2013 Anti-corruption Campaign is one of the first major policy moves implemented by Xi Jinping after he stepped into office. It involved “central inspection teams” governed directly by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) spending weeks to months thoroughly reviewing the conducts of local officials and major state-owned enterprise (SOE) executives in each province. Extensive prior literature has provided evidence to support the high effectiveness of the campaign in reducing the willingness of local government officials to engage in corrupt behaviors (Lin, Morck, Yeung, Zhao, 2016, Lan, Li, 2018, Chen, Kung, 2019). Hypothetically, the anti-corruption campaign should have no effects on firms’ philanthropic behaviors if such behaviors are not targeted at getting policy favors from government officials. However, if Chinese firms use charitable donations to engage in shady favor exchanges with government officials, then we expect the campaign to significantly reduce firms’ donations. Moreover, given that non-transparent favor exchanges between government officials and firms require a high level of trust between colluding parties, we expect the negative effect of the anti-corruption campaign on donations to be concentrated on firms with strong political connections. We formally illustrate this heterogeneous effect of the anti-corruption campaign on firm donations in a simple model, in which firms allocate limited resources between productive and non-productive favor-extracting activities, such as charitable donations, and the level of the firms’ political connections and charitable donations complement each other in increasing the amount of favors they obtain from the government.====Guided by this simple model, we can test whether Chinese firms indeed use charitable donations to extract policy favors by examining how the anti-corruption campaign heterogeneously affects the donation behaviors of firms with different extents of political connections. Specifically, we adopt a difference-in-difference strategy and estimate how the change in firms’ charitable donations before and after the anti-corruption campaign varies across firms with different extents of pre-campaign political connections.====Our data consists of annual firm-level data on Chinese listed companies from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database from 2008 to 2016. The database gives detailed information on each firm’s annual charitable donations, their inputs, outputs, financial transactions, and stock market performance. It likewise provides the demographics, political affiliation, and past positions of all board members of each firm. Following existing literature (Du, Zeng, Du, 2014, Fan, Liu, Li, Zeng, An, 2017, Peng, Zhang, Zhu, 2017, Cheng, 2018), we measure the political connection of a firm by the share of its board members who are (or used to be) affiliated with major national political or governmental organizations.====Consistent with the corrupt favor exchange hypothesis, we find that the anti-corruption campaign has significant heterogeneous effects on firms’ charitable donations. Compared to a firm with no political connections, a one-standard-deviation increase in the level of a firm’s political connection reduces the firm’s post-campaign donations by about 15.6%. To demonstrate that the reduction in charitable donations of connected firms arose from a change in their incentives, rather than reflecting connected firms’ change in financial circumstances after the anti-corruption campaign, we also use donation as a share of firms’ total annual revenue as a dependent variable in our regressions. We find that, even in donation shares, firms with stronger political connections experience a significantly bigger decline in charitable donations relative to firms with weaker connections. Moreover, we observe that the bigger reduction in charitable donations among politically connected firms is more salient in provinces with higher observed level of corruption.====To further support the notion that the charitable donations of firms may be an instrument for favor exchanges between firms and government officials, we examine how charitable donations and the anti-corruption campaign affect the amount of subsidies firms receive from the government. Consistent with our corrupt favor exchange hypothesis, we find that a firm’s charitable donations positively affect the amount of policy favors the firm obtains from the government. Moreover, the positive effect of such donations on received subsidies is substantially stronger during the pre-campaign period, which is consistent with the anti-corruption campaign effectively reducing the possibility of collusive favor exchanges between firms and the government. Using the same diff-in-diff identification strategy, we also verify that the significant reduction in donations among firms with strong political connections is accompanied with less government subsidies to these firms. A one-standard-deviation increase in the level of political connection reduced firm subsidies by approximately 15.2% after the campaign.====Our empirical results imply that the anti-corruption campaign has been effective in reducing the probability of firms using donations to extract policy favors from governments. However, is the reduction in favor exchanges all bad for the firms? According to our model, when firms face limited managerial time and resources, a reduction in the returns of non-productive favor-extracting activities can mean that firms will allocate additional resources and managerial time to productivity-improving activities. We empirically test this prediction of the model by adopting the same strategy to examine how the anti-corruption campaign heterogeneously affects the productivity of firms with different levels of political connection. Consistent with our model’s prediction, we find that the significant reductions in charitable donations and received subsidies by politically connected firms after the anti-corruption campaign were accompanied by a significant increase in these firms’ production efficiency. In particular, relative to a non-connected firm, a one-standard-deviation increase in political connection increases the post-campaign total factor productivity (TFP) of a firm by about 1.4%. Our finding on the positive efficiency implications of the anti-corruption campaign is consistent with existing empirical literature (Dal Bo and Rossi, 2007), which finds a negative effect of corruption on the factor allocation efficiency and productivity of firms.====Our study contributes to the literature on three grounds. First, it adds to the literature on firm donation. The majority of these existing studies focus on firms’ pro-social activities to attract socially conscious consumers (Navarro, 1988, Brown, Helland, Smith, 2006, Benabou, Tirole, 2009) or public stake holders (Wang, Qian, 2011, Hornstein, Zhao, Werner, 2015, Jia, Shi, Wang).==== Our study highlights a more self-serving motivation of charitable giving by firms: donations may be an instrument that firms use to extract policy favors from government officials. Although our work focuses on China, charitable donation as an instrument for political influence is a general phenomenon. For example, Sanchez (2000) discusses politically strategic motives of corporate philanthropy in El Salvador, and Bertrand et al. (2018) find that charitable contributions directed to a congressional district may serve as a useful channel of political influence in the US.====Second, our study adds to the research that estimates the value of political connections to corporations (Roberts, 1990, Fisman, 2001, Faccio, 2006, Jayachandran, 2006, Fan, Wong, Zhang, 2007, Goldman, Rocholl, So, 2009) and relates to the studies on the consequences of corruption (Mauro, 1995, Reinikka, Svensson, 2004, Dal Bo, Rossi, 2007, Bertrand, Djankov, Hanna, Mullainathan, 2007, Olken, Pande, 2012). Emphasizing the high transaction costs of corrupt dealings (Shleifer, Vishny, 1994, Lambsdorff, 2002, Fisman, Gatti, 2006), our work argues that one source of the value of political connection is that it lowers transaction costs for firms to conduct favor exchanges with government officials, which are common in China (Lei, 2019). However, our results also suggest that the possibility of such rent-seeking favor exchanges, while increasing the access of firms to subsidies and other policy favors, may simultaneously have detrimental effects on the firms’ production efficiency, possibly through shifting firm resources away from efficiency-improving activities. This detrimental effect of corruption on production efficiency can severely undermine the value of political connections for individual firms and, at the same time, suggests one way in which corruption may have a negative effect on a country’s overall economic development.====Finally, by examining the effects of China’s anti-corruption campaign on firm donations and government subsidies, our study speaks to the literature on the effectiveness of various means in combating corruption.==== Although existing studies seem to suggest that government-led anti-corruption campaigns have weak effects (Webb, 2008, Olken, Pande, 2012, Persson, Rothstein, Teorell, 2013), our work demonstrates that China’s anti-corruption campaign was effective in combating corrupt collusion between firms and government officials, a finding that complements an emerging literature that documents the effectiveness of the campaign (Lin, Morck, Yeung, Zhao, 2016, Lan, Li, 2018, Giannetti, Liao, You, Yu, Chen, Kung, 2019, Gan, Xu, 2019).====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background and explains why, in the political-economic setting of China, it is likely that firms use charitable donations as an instrument to exchange favors with governmental officials.

Evidence is presented that these institutional differences dating back to the antiquity are shaped by special geographical conditions. These institutional differences can be seen to be at the root of the two cultural systems in today's world: individualism and collectivism. These cultural differences have effects on economic performance and institutions in today's world.","In recent years, a vibrant new literature has developed on the economics of culture. A large part of that literature examines the effects of cultural values and beliefs on economic outcomes (growth, institutions, fertility choices, female labor force participation, ….) It is more challenging to understand the origins of different cultures. The existing literature on the origins of culture aims at understanding the role of particular historical variables on particular cultural traits. A good example is the research by Alesina et al. (2013) on how differences in soil types led to the choice of use of the plough or the hoe in working the fields, and how this affected gender roles and cultural norms related to gender (other examples are discussed below). To this day, there has not been systematic analysis of the role of historical institutional systems on broad cultural systems. This is what we try to do in this paper.====Economists interested in comparative institutional analysis tend to emphasize institutional differences from the recent past (the salient example being the difference between capitalist and socialist economic systems in the twentieth century), and there is often the preconception that pre-industrial economic systems were roughly similar, or that their differences were not that marked. However, if we go back in history, as early as what Jaspers (1951) calls the axial age (between the 8th and 3rd century BC), we will find that there existed very different institutional systems among early states. The philosophies and religions that emerged during the axial age were a reflection of the existing institutions of the time and one can argue that their differences reflected institutional differences across the major existing civilizations. Surprisingly and interestingly, the philosophies and religions of the axial age (ancient Greek philosophy, Hinduism, Bhuddism, Zoroastranism, Confucianism, Judaism, etc.…) nearly all still play an important role in the modern world. They are the main inspiration behind modern cultures and cultural differences observed in today's world.====Looking at economic systems in the ancient world, we find that some systems (Egypt, China, Peru under the Incas and others) were more like centrally planned economies. There was no private property of land (the land belonged to the Emperor or ruler), agricultural goods and craft goods were allocated by the government. Markets were hardly developed and foreign trade was under the control of government. For lack of a better wording, I will call them statist systems. Other economies, like ancient Mesopotamia, Athens, the Aztecs in Mexico, the Champa (covering roughly today's South Vietnam) were more clearly market economies with private property of land and developed markets, both domestically and internationally. I will call them market systems. Many other systems were in between both of these systems, as documented below.====These differences have been noted before. Max Weber (1922) used the term of ==== to characterize states like Ancient China and others where the absolute domination of the father figure in a family is projected onto the state. Private and public property are not differentiated in the patrimonial state.====Wittfogel (1957) theorized about oriental despotism and hypothesized that the absolutist rule in ancient China and Egypt was based on fact that the absolutist rule facilitated what he called the hydraulic state where the state organized large scale irrigation systems, which created conditions that made bureaucratic and government despotism inevitable.====Polanyi et al. (1954) documented the limited role of markets where private goods were exchanged in many locations in the Antiquity.====Trigger (2003) provides a very interesting classification of ancient societies, based on archeological evidence. He emphasizes mostly the difference between territorial states and city-states but his classification is quite comprehensive and based on extensive scholarly evidence.====Among economists, Greif and Tabellini (2017) analyze the relative importance of clans in formation of cities in China and Europe. They find that in Chinese history, the development of cities was based on clans and clan organization, which has played an extended role in Chinese history. In contrasts, cities in Western Europe developed on the basis of individual citizenship. They trace these differences to cultural differences: generalized morality in Europe versus limited morality within the clan in China. The cultural differences they emphasize are close to the difference between individualism and collectivism that we put forward in this study.====British historian MacFarlane (1978) found that as early as the 13th century, individualist culture was more prevalent in Great Britain than on the European continent and that households tended to be more nuclear, relying more on the market in economic transactions than societies where people were embedded in larger clans.====Mayshar et al. (2017) emphasize the role of transparency in production. Whenever output could easily be measured, peasants worked directly for the state, as was the case in ancient Egypt. When output was instead less transparent, peasants had property rights over land like in Mesopotamia.====In this paper, I present a data base constructed I the past few years based on historical and archeological research to characterize the major differences between statist systems and market systems in the antiquity. The evidence presented shows clearly that these two systems form distinct institutional clusters that are comparable to the difference between socialism and capitalism in the twentieth century. These different systems operated in mostly rural societies where modern industrial technology was absent and where labor and land were the major factors of production.====Why do these differences matter today? Why study the difference between statist and market systems in the distant past except to satisfy our natural historical curiosity? The argument put forward in this paper is that these institutional differences from the past matter a lot to understand the world's long run economic and societal trajectories. Indeed, following Bisin and Verdier's (2001, 2017) canonical analysis of the dynamics of cultural transmission, and especially the joint dynamics of institutions and culture, we can hypothesize that particular early institutions have affected cultural values and beliefs, which has in turn helped consolidate both these institutions and the underlying culture. Given the inertia of culture predicted from the Bisin-Verdier model (see also Roland, 2004), institutions may have affected cultural values and beliefs that are still present in today's world.====The main cultural divide in the world today, according to cross-cultural psychology, is the one between individualism and collectivism (see Heine, 2008; see also the survey in Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2012). Individualist culture places the individual at the center, values individual rights and freedom, opportunity and individual success. Collectivist culture sees instead the individual as embedded in a community (tribe, clan), emphasizes conformity, adaptation and harmony.====These cultural differences have important effects in today's world. In Gorodnichenko and Roland (2017), it is shown that individualist culture provides a boost to innovation and long run growth. Individualism also affects institutional change. In Gorodnichenko and Roland (2015), individualism leads to earlier adoption of democracy than collectivism, and the latter may lead to stable autocracy. The degree of vertical integration in multi-national companies is also seen to depend on cultural differences, especially between individualism and collectivism (see Gorodnichenko et al., 2019). Many other variables can be argued to be affected by these cultural differences (see Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2012).====While economists have increasingly recognized the importance of culture, alongside institutions, on economic outcomes, there is also a large literature trying to explain the origin of cultural differences. This is not an easy topic because it is difficult to disentangle the effects of culture from their causes, and filtering out the causes of culture is important to better understand its effects.====Psychologists Kashima and Kashima (1998) remarked that cultural values could be traced back to linguistic differences. To the extent that the structure of a language reflects cultural values and beliefs, one can analyze linguistic and grammatical structures to discover cultural differences. Kashima and Kashima pointed out an important difference: whether or not a language prohibits to drop the personal pronoun in a sentence. This is for example prohibited in French, German and English, but not in Italian or Spanish. The idea is that a prohibition would indicate a more individualist culture as it insists on differentiating individuals by a clear indication of the pronoun used (first, second or third person). Another distinction is whether a language has or not two different pronouns for the second person (==== and ==== in Latin) to differentiate between a more informal and a more formal way of addressing a person. The existence of two distinct pronouns for the second person of the singular (existing in French and Italian but not in English for example) would indicate a more hierarchic and less egalitarian culture. Similarly, they also single out whether there is a single or several expressions for the first pronoun of the singular. For example, there is only one expression in English (I), but several in other languages like Japanese. The idea is that if there are multiple expressions, language emphasizes more the social function of the person whereas if there is only one expression, language emphasizes more the individuality. Kashima and Kashima (1998) document the statistical correlation between the linguistic measures they put forward and measures of culture such as Hofstede's individualism score. Some of their variables have been used as instrumental variables to analyze the effect of culture on institutions (see e.g. Licht et al., 2003, Tabellini, 2008).====Other researchers have emphasized the role of the distribution of particular variants of genes in different countries in shaping cultural values. For example, Chiao and Blizinsky, (2010) analyzed the role of variants of genes (called alleles in life sciences) that lead more easily to depression when faced with stressful situations. Similarly, Way and Liebermann (2010) analyzed the role of variants of genes that create more pain from social exclusion. These authors found that a higher frequency of those variants of genes were more present in societies with collectivist culture. The basic idea is that those societies and communities with higher frequency of those alleles that developed cultural values and social norms to protect individuals from stressful situations and social exclusion would fare better than those that did not develop such values and norms.====A similar logic is found with the historical presence of particular pathogens. Fincher et al. (2008) and Murray and Schaller (2010) find that countries where there was a strong presence of pathogens before the 20th century developed more collectivist cultures. Again, the idea is that in areas with high presence of pathogens, those communities that developed more collectivist norms, restricting individual behavior and showing a less open attitude towards foreigners would be more likely to survive better.====Other explanations for the origin of individualism versus collectivism involve the higher frequency of rice crops over other wheat crops since rice is more labor-intensive and requires better coordination (Talhelm et al., 2014) or a higher presence of irrigation (Buggle, 2015), in the spirit of Wittfogel (1957). On the other hand, Knudsen (2017) finds that a higher reliance on fishing for one's livelihood in history is more associated to individualism.====These are all interesting explanations, and most of those variables have been used as instrumental variables for individualism and collectivism. Nevertheless, it is relatively easy to see that these explanations are partial at best. Given the important effects of culture on institutions and economic performance, one would gain from coming up with a more comprehensive historical explanation of the emergence of cultural differences. In particular, we find it useful to do this within a conceptual framework of coevolution of institutions and culture. This is precisely our goal in this paper. We have gathered a number of variables that characterize institutional differences in the ancient past as well as geographical variables that may explain these early institutional differences.====In Section 2, we provide some narratives from the antiquity to illustrate the institutional differences in ancient societies that we focus on. On that basis, we develop in Section 3 a classification of variables that should matter to understand these institutional clusters of the past, their origin and their coevolution with cultural value systems. In Section 4, we describe the database we have been building to measure those variables. In Section 5, we give some preliminary descriptive regression results based on this new data set.

Fundamental tenets of economic freedom assert that societies free of excessive government involvement are wealthier and, ultimately, happier; individuals who are allowed to pursue self-interest are argued to be more motivated and more productive, and so society as a whole is better off. Though there is substantial empirical evidence that freer societies are wealthier, the evidence connecting economic freedom and happiness is less clear. We explore the relationship between economic freedom and SWL at the individual level. We examine differences between personal preferences for free markets and state policy and how this ‘preference-policy mismatch’ is related to SWL. We then briefly examine the relationship between preference-policy mismatches and individual self-reported voting behavior, including implications for Tiebout sorting. This study is the first to focus on individual economic ideology, i.e. individual level of support for free markets, and SWL in the United States. Combining individual and state level data we offer improvements to prior studies in a number of areas including an enhanced measure of life satisfaction, a richer basis for examining left-right differences than simple political identification, and an examination of the effect of preference-policy mismatches on satisfaction with life. We find significant relationships between SWL and individual support for markets, state-level economic freedom, and preference-policy mismatch. Further, preference-policy mismatch is positively associated with self-reported voting frequency. We find little support for Tiebout sorting.","Satisfaction with life (SWL) is correlated with a wide range of socio-economic variables including income, age, gender, marital status, religion, employment, inflation, and multiple measures of government intervention in the economy (MacKerron, 2012; Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2013; Bhuiyan et al., 2017). The body of work examining “satisfaction with life”, “life satisfaction”, or “happiness”==== published in the economics literature has grown rapidly since 2000 (MacKerron 2012; Bhuiyan and Szulga, 2017), including papers in leading journals (e.g., De Neve et al., 2018; Proto and Oswald, 2017; Oswald and Wu 2011; Knabe et al., 2010; DiTella and MacCulloch 2005; Di Tella et al. 2001). This paper focuses on one area in this line of research that is of particular interest to economists and yet is under researched: the effects on SWL of the interaction between individual preferences for markets and government intervention in the economy.====Fundamental tenets of economic freedom assert that societies free of excessive government involvement are wealthier and, ultimately, happier. Individuals who are allowed to pursue self-interest are argued to be more motivated and more productive, and so society as a whole is better off. Though there is substantial empirical evidence that freer societies are wealthier, the evidence connecting economic freedom and happiness is less clear. We suggest that because less government intervention is not a universal preference, some individuals may be less happy in the presence of more economic freedom. We exploit a unique data set to examine the relationship between economic freedom and SWL at the individual level and mismatches between personal preferences for freedom and state policy. We then explore the impact of preference-policy mismatches on self-reported voter behavior.====It seems almost axiomatic that freer people must be happier. More choice and more control over one's own actions are well-known to be positively associated with multiple psychological measures (e.g., Gore 2016; Bandura et al., 1997). Yet, preferences for government intervention, and therefore less individual control and choice, vary from individual to individual. Regulations, for example, may be seen by some as infringements on individual economic freedom while others may see them as needed protection from market forces.==== Acknowledging heterogeneous preferences allows for differing responses to greater economic freedom. As part of our analysis, we examine this “left-right” divide identified in some prior cross-country studies: left leaning ideology has been associated with lower levels of SWL compared to right leaning. For ease of interpretation, we identify the “right” (of the economic ideology spectrum) as those who view regulations, taxes, etc. as an infringement on freedoms; for them, a reduction in regulation, etc. would be expected to lead to greater happiness. For those on the opposite end of the spectrum, the “left”, that same reduction in regulation would be expected to lead to less happiness.==== We hypothesize that individuals whose personal preferences for economic freedom do not match state policies will have lower SWL than individuals whose preferences are aligned with those policies. That is, an individual on the “left” living in a right leaning (high economic freedom) state or vice-versa might very well be marginally less happy than others. Thus, an increase in state-level economic freedom may identifiably lead to higher SWL for some and lower SWL for others. Consequently, we consider individuals’ preferences for economic freedom in the context of state-level government intervention in economic choices, as measured by regulation, taxes, and the like, as we examine how mismatches between individual preferences and state policy are correlated with SWL. We also connect preference-policy mismatch to self-reported voting behavior, as one example of the wider implications of such dissatisfaction. Though Flavin and Keane (2012) examine the connection between SWL and voting we believe we are the first to examine preference-policy mismatch and voting in the context of economic freedom.====We provide several potential improvements over and extensions of the current understanding of government policies and its effect on SWL. Recent research has focused on cross-country studies, most often using the World Values Survey (WVS) and the European Values Survey (EVS) as sources of SWL (Bjørnskov et al., 2007; Drehert 2011; Nikolaev 2014; Knoll et al., 2013; Gehring 2013; Curini et al., 2014). These studies generally find a positive correlation between Economic freedom and SWL and that those on the ideological left (sometimes referred to in these papers as liberals’) tend to be less happy than those on the ideological right (‘conservatives’).==== Nearly all of these studies rely on one-question measures of SWL, a Likert-type scale with either 10, 4, or 3 points,==== arguably a less reliable measure of satisfaction than multiple statement scales such as that of Diener et al. (1985), used in this study. Prior studies can also be criticized for using self-rated measures of individual liberal-conservative ideology and for using the ambiguous terms ‘left-wing’ and ‘right-wing’ as prompts in that self-assessment. We measure economic ideology via a multi-statement index that focuses exclusively on economic issues and we define “left” and “right” based on placement along this continuum. Prior studies also proxy economic freedom by political party affiliation or vote shares rather than direct measures of government policies. While party affiliation and economic freedom may be expected to be correlated generally (e.g., Republicans favor less government intervention while Democrats favor more), we argue that the affiliation (or vote share) of the party currently in power is a poor proxy for current economic freedom governed by myriad policies, economic, social, and foreign. Unlike prior studies, we use a well-established measure of economic freedom based on objective measures of government intervention.====This study is the first to focus on individual preferences for economic freedom and SWL in the United States.==== Our data set consists of individual-level survey responses from United States residents collected expressly for this study. We extend prior analysis with our examination of ====, adding an important nuance to the understanding of the impacts of government intervention in the economy. In sum, we offer improvements on prior studies in a number of areas including an enhanced measure of life satisfaction, a richer examination of the left-right divide than simple political identification, use of a more comprehensive measure of state-level economic freedom, and most significantly, an examination of the effect of preference-policy mismatches on satisfaction with life.","The company you keep: Satisfaction with life, economic freedom, and preference-policy mismatch",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596719301027,27 February 2020,2020,Research Article,173.0

This paper presents simulated experimental findings on spatial heterogeneity in secession proneness across 264 regions belonging to 26 European countries. To do so, it develops a broad model of state fragmentation that reconciles the views of the dominant strands in the literature. In order to apply the model, a novel indicator of regional political distinctiveness is proposed, rooted in the discrepancy between regional and national electoral behavior. Using this new indicator, we show that regional electoral heterogeneity has been on the rise in Europe in the past 40 years, offering an empirical rationale for the simultaneous rise in regionalism that is consistent with contemporary economic thinking on optimal country size. Calibrating our model to the current European situation, we find that Catalonia, Flanders and the Basque country are the regions currently predicted to be the most likely to break away. In line with these results, governments in all three regions have consistently vocalized demands for increased autonomy - or even secession - in recent years. Denmark, Hungary and Slovenia show up as the most secession-robust European countries.","With independence referendums in Scotland and Catalonia, increasing electoral support for regionalist parties in Belgium and Italy and the recent separatist tensions in Ukraine, the threat of regional instability seems well on its way to reclaim a prominent spot on the European political agenda. One novel feature is that regional independence movements increasingly utilize the electoral arena to posit their claims for more regional autonomy - or even secession - from the central government (Sorens, 2008).====In the slipstream of these events, economists have developed a small but growing theoretical literature aimed at isolating the political and economic forces that determine these processes of border formation.==== Agreeing on the fact that larger countries benefit from scale economies in the provision of public goods, one approach contends that larger political jurisdictions also suffer heterogeneity costs stemming from more diverse policy preferences (Alesina, Spolaore, 1997, Alesina, Spolaore, 2003) whereas a quite different strand of the literature highlights differing fiscal preferences, originating from interregional income distribution differentials, in shaping incentives to secede (Bolton and Roland, 1997). As mentioned by Spolaore (2010), however, the theoretical study of the relationship between preference heterogeneity, income differences and the stability of countries is still in its infancy. Furthermore, quantitative applications of these frameworks remain scarce, such that their empirical validity and practical implications remain unclear.====This paper aims to make progress on both fronts. First, it aims to reconcile the two dominant strands of the theoretical literature surrounding regional (in)stability by proposing a broad theoretical model of state fragmentation that combines key insights from both approaches. Secondly, as a way of validating the model, it is applied to a set of 264 regions in 26 European countries to identify both the most secession-prone European regions and the most secession-robust European countries. In doing so, it also diverges from the existing literature - which tends to approximate regional preference heterogeneity by the genetic, ethno-linguistic or cultural distances among populations - and proposes a novel and more direct indicator of regional political distinctiveness, rooted in the discrepancy between regional and national electoral behavior.====From the outset, it is important to stress that our analysis abstracts from the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), or the potential endogeneity of administrative borders (Openshaw, 1984). That is, although Seraphim (1999) finds no evidence in this regard, countries may gerrymander their administrative boundaries to dilute separatist potential in any given unit. A complete analysis could therefore require extending the model to account for the way in which central governments spatially delineate subnational units. We simply note that existing administrative boundaries are what determines separatist potential in Europe today and restrict our attention to assessing spatial heterogeneity in secession proneness ====.====In our model, central governments provide a single public good representing a bundle of policy choices. Public policy is financed through a proportional income tax schedule, determined through majority voting. Agents, residing in a particular region of their country, vote on the optimal level of public spending taking into account increasing returns to scale in the provision of public goods, the intensity of their preference for the public good, the political distinctiveness of their policy preferences as well as their individual income level. Both richer agents and agents with more distinct policy preferences have a preference for lower tax rates, poorer agents and agents with policy preferences more closely aligned to those of the majority of the electorate prefer higher taxes; the equilibrium tax rate is the one most preferred by the median tax voter. These assumptions generate a trade-off: separation would allow agents within a region to exercise greater influence on the content and the size of government whereas preserving the union would allow them to exploit economies of scale in the provision of government.====The main contribution of the paper is to assess the validity and the empirical implications of this theoretical model with respect to the current map of Europe. Applying the baseline model to a set of over 260 regions in 26 European countries we find that, in a context of rising regionalism, Catalonia, Flanders and the Basque country are currently predicted to be the most likely to break away. Consistent with these results, local governments in all three regions have systematically called for increased regional autonomy and two of them recently took steps to organize independence referendums. Further down the list, we quickly run into other ‘usual suspects’, such as Scotland (4th), Italian South-Tyrol (7th) and the French isle of Corsica (9th), but we also encounter lesser-known separatist hotspots, including Bulgaria’s Turkish minorities in the provinces of Kardzhali (5th) and Razgrad (10th) and the Hungarian minority in Romania’s Transylvanic region (11th). Focusing on the most secession-robust countries, we find that Denmark, Hungary and Slovenia top the list, closely followed by Norway and the Czech Republic. Reassuringly, these countries effectively seem to lack the presence of credible autonomist movements.====As preference heterogeneity plays an important role in our model, our quantitative application primarily emphasizes the centrifugal effects of Alesina, Spolaore, 1997, Alesina, Spolaore, 2003 distinctiveness channel over those of Bolton and Roland (1997) fiscal channel. To do so, it critically relies on a novel indicator that quantifies regional political distinctiveness as the divergence between regional and national electoral behavior. We argue that this indicator offers a number of advantages over existing indicators: first, it offers a more direct measurement of societal disagreements on topics that are politically salient; second, it is a dynamic indicator that can capture sudden shifts in reaction to contemporary political events; third, it can easily be computed for many countries over long time periods using publicly available data, drastically opening up the possibilities for future research. One ==== is that the measure does presuppose a democratic setting, as electoral variation is only meaningful when everyone is free to express their policy preferences at the ballot box. Hence, this indicator may be less useful in contexts where elections are banned, falsified or meaningless due to low participation rates, limits on the franchise or political party bans.====Using this indicator to put European political heterogeneity in a historical perspective reveals that regional electoral distinctiveness increased throughout the 19th century, indicating an increasing vulnerability to the destabilizing effects of regionalism throughout this period; that regional party preferences converged drastically in the aftermath of World War 2, reaching a low point in the early70′s; and finally that the most recent period is characterized by a persistent resurgence in regional electoral heterogeneity. Interestingly, this recent intensification in electoral heterogeneity over the past 40 years thus offers an empirical rationale for the simultaneous rise in European regionalism that is consistent with contemporary economic thinking on the determinants of country size.====Finally, although the proposed index should serve as a satisfactory and comprehensive measure for political heterogeneity in most applications, one complication in our quantitative analysis is its use as a proxy for regional ==== preference distinctiveness. Indeed, to the extent that electoral behavior is also driven by differing ==== preferences on optimal government size, our proxy may be endogenous with the fiscal channels in our model. Therefore, a robustness check proposes a residual approach and an instrumental variable approach to extract a more reliable indicator of regional policy preference distinctiveness from our proposed measure of electoral distinctiveness. Subsequently, it accounts for model calibration uncertainty by iteratively recalibrating the baseline model over a wide range of plausible parameter values for policy preference distinctiveness. Although the results indicate that model calibration uncertainty often prevents an unambiguous ranking of regions that are ranked similarly in terms of their predicted secession proneness, we find converging evidence across a wide range of plausible model calibrations that Flanders, Catalonia, Scotland and the Basque country are currently among the most secession-prone European regions. Moreover, there emerges a general consensus on the broad categorizations of regions in terms of their secession proneness, demonstrating the model’s ability to distinguish secession-prone from secession-robust regions. These results are taken as tentative proof of the model’s capacity to partially explain present-day heterogeneity in regional instability in a European context, meriting further research on its general applicability.====Our analysis is most closely related to Desmet et al. (2011), who connect genetic distances among populations to national stability of borders within a theoretical model of border formation. Calibrating this model enables them to accurately reproduce the historical order of disintegration of former Yugoslavia into five separate states. Limited availability of interregional genetic distances, however, restricts their exploration of present-day regional instability to just three separatist hotspots in Europe. As a result, it remains unclear to what extent their model can also adequately distinguish secession-prone from secession-robust regions. Additionally, their model abstracts from intra-regional income distribution differentials as well as spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of preference for the public good. Finally, their quantitative analysis lacks an inferential framework to assess the sensitivity of simulated regional secession proneness to calibration uncertainty. Our work is also close in spirit to Lake and O’Mahony (2004), who relate the long-term trend in average state size to the general trends in a number of potential determinants but fail to find any clear empirical explanation for the incredible rise and subsequent fall in average state size in modern history.====Additionally, this paper is also related to the political science literature surrounding nationalism and separatism, where various papers use multi-country panel data on the variation in the electoral results of separatist and autonomist political parties to tease out the determinants of secessionism in advanced democracies (Sorens, 2005, Sorens, 2008, Sorens, 2009, Álvarez Pereira, Portos, Vourdas, 2018). This literature tends to confirm the importance of relative regional affluence, population size, language and ideological differences for the electoral success of regionalist and/or separatist parties. Similarly, Suesse (2018) exploits regional variation in pro-secessionist protests in the former Soviet Union to test various economic theories of regional instability, finding strong evidence for the existence of a trade-off between regional size and two proxies for population heterogeneity, but remaining inconclusive with respect to the role of interregional income differences. Fearon and Van Houten (2002) nevertheless warn that popular support for separatist movements ==== may paint a biased picture of the true demand for independence, as the attractiveness of separatist mobilization may at least partially stem from the improvement of regional bargaining power within the union and the rents that can subsequently be extracted from the central government through the creation of a secessionist ‘threat point’.==== Moreover, one advantage of our proposed methodology is that it also formally describes how these channels jointly affect border stability. Finally, our empirical strategy also permits the analysis of regional (in)stability in democratic countries lacking politically significant autonomist movements - or where these movements are prohibited by law.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the basic model, while the proposed indicator of electoral heterogeneity is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 explains the empirical strategy and contains the data description. Section 5 calibrates the model and identifies the most secession-prone regions as well as the most secession-robust countries in Europe.

So was the post-conflict provision of economic resources to districts related to their involvement in promoting the Maoist cause? We tackle this question combining theory and empirics. Our model predicts that poorer districts are more likely to support the Maoists and in return they get promised economic gains conditional on the Maoists prevailing post-conflict. Combining data on conflict with consumption expenditure data from the Nepal Living Standards Survey and data on foreign aid, we test these predictions. Our panel data estimates and our cross-sectional analysis consistently find strong support for our hypotheses. These are confirmed by the IV analysis that we perform at the panel level.","Civil wars have been studied by academics from various disciplines and from many different angles. Given that civil wars have persisted over centuries in this world and have affected millions of lives, this attention is quite justified. According to Miguel et al. (2004), the toll civil wars have taken dwarf the casualties exacted by inter-state wars since World War II. Even though sub-Saharan Africa has borne the brunt of civil wars for decades now, this phenomenon is by no means restricted to that area. In recent years, several countries in Asia too have witnessed civil conflict. We study the decade-long Maoist uprising in Nepal (1996–2006) which eventually culminated in the abolition of monarchy in 2008 and brought the left parties considerable success in the elections that followed. Clearly, this civil war resulted in strengthening multi-party democracy and reducing the erstwhile powerful monarch to a titular head.====We are interested in studying the economic implications of civil conflict. In particular, our interest is in the fortunes of different groups ==== and how it may be connected to their participation in the conflict. The civil conflict in Nepal is a context amenable to studying such issues especially given that the challenger (the Maoist group) achieved a large degree of political power after the hostilities ended. The questions which interest us are: (i) Which groups tend to participate more in conflict? (ii) Are they rewarded in a manner commensurate with their efforts? In other words, was there an implicit ====? Nepal witnessed a large reduction in poverty levels over the period 1995–2010. However, the reduction was far from uniform across the districts.==== Given that this period roughly coincides with the duration of the civil war and the subsequent joining of the Maoist parties in the government, can one link this differential poverty reduction to the putative “rewards” story? (iii) Do the observed patterns of poverty and inequality shed light on the challenger’s objective? Specifically, does the new government behave in a clientelistic manner or more like a benevolent social planner?====We attempt to answer such questions by combining theory with empirical analysis. In our model, there are three key sets of actors: the Maoist group, the king and the citizens of the nation. The citizens are partitioned into groups which may be thought of social, income or occupational categories. The main feature is that the groups have different income distributions; so they can be ranked in terms of average incomes. In this way we are able to isolate the interplay between group-level income and conflict. The game proceeds as follows. First, the Maoists decide whether or not they want to challenge the regime. If they do challenge, then both the Maoist group and the king simultaneously decide on how hard to fight. Specifically, the Maoist group promises (non-negative) transfers to the various groups which are to be delivered to them only if the Maoist group prevails in the conflict. Thus, these transfers are the “rewards” conditional on a Maoist victory. These transfers are to be financed out of a budget whose control lies with the head of the government. The idea is that once the Maoists win the power of the king will be heavily curtailed and the country will move to democracy.====The king can use his finances to buy effort from his army to combat the rebels.==== The extent of military effort has the ability to affect the final outcome of conflict.==== Faced with these choices, the groups then decide individually and simultaneously on their supply of effort for the Maoists. Of course, choosing to supply zero effort is possible and is interpreted as not supporting the Maoists.====We impute two very different objective functions, in turn, to the Maoists. First, we assume that the Maoists are aiming to maximise private gains — so they try to “purchase” conflict efforts from the various groups as economically as possible. In the other scenario, we assume that the Maoists are entirely motivated by welfare concerns; here, they promise transfers as a benevolent social planner would. Their aim is to maximise some form of a Benthamite social welfare function. We show that poorer groups contribute more effort to support the Maoists ==== of the motivations of the Maoists.==== This is without any assumption of ideological affinities between them and the Maoists. Moreover, they do so even when they are promised ==== transfers — in absolute terms — as compared to their rich counterparts (in the case where the Maoists behave opportunistically). Next, we show that there is an implicit lower bound on how “cheaply” the poorer groups can be bought (in this “opportunistic Maoists” case) so that they turn out to be gainers in a relative sense. This aspect of conflict-based reward is what we try to establish empirically. Additionally, the two different motivations for the Maoists bear different implications in terms of movements in poverty and inequality. We use our empirical analysis to test which of the two motivations obtains greater validation.====Using data on conflict, data on consumption expenditure from the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS) and foreign aid data, we created a district-level panel. We have data on consumption expenditure for the pre-conflict period from the NLSS-I (conducted during 1995-96) and for the post-conflict period we use the third wave of NLSS that was conducted in 2010-11. We combine these with data on projects financed through foreign aid. These projects are mainly for the purpose of a district’s infrastructural and economic development. This is what we primarily use as our measure for transfers (“rewards”) to districts.====Using these data and performing both panel level and cross-sectional analysis, we consistently find that districts which experienced higher levels of conflict during the decade-long Maoist war were more likely to have a greater number of foreign aided projects in years after the war even when controlling for the district-level poverty rate. Our results survive a series of robustness checks: alternative measures of conflict, of poverty, of inequality. We split the projects into seven broad categories and separately examined the results for each category. By and large, these sectoral regressions re-iterate our main findings.====We also conduct a Two-Stages Least Squares (IV) analysis to check the robustness of our findings. It is argued that one of the important sources of funds for the Maoists came from the control of timber smuggling to India. We exploit this channel in terms of developing an instrument for our conflict measure(s) at the district level. The ecology (specifically, the elevation and vegetation) varies considerably across the different districts of Nepal. However, the type(s) of timber a district can offer is clearly a time-invariant entity. However, the prices of these — in India — ==== vary over time. Thus, a weighted index of these prices at the district-level — where the weights come from the proportion of the district vegetation falling into one of the ecological categories — would be a measure of the funding sources of the Maoists from the district at a point in time. Insofar the price movements in timber in India are independent of the aid disbursements/targetted transfers in Nepal (our outcome variables), such a weighted index would be exogenous and hence allow for improved identification of the effects. The results from our IV analysis re-enforces and in fact strengthens our basic findings.====All in all, our empirical results strongly corroborate with our theoretical predictions. Moreover, we cannot discern any effect of conflict-proneness on either poverty or inequality — this suggests that the motivations of the Maoists appear closer to those of the opportunistic/clientelistic agent rather than that of the benevolent planner.====Our work relates in different ways to several strands of the relatively recent but growing literature on conflict.==== It adds to the literature on the relationship between economic conditions and warfare (see e.g., Acemoglu and Robinson (2001), Bates et al. (2002), Chassang and Padro-i Miquel (2009), Esteban and Ray (1999), Esteban and Ray (2008), Gawande et al. (2012), Grossman (1991), Grossman and Kim (1995), Hirshleifer (1991), Skaperdas (1992)). In terms of linking the budget size to conflict intensity our model speaks to the conflict and state capacity issue raised by Fearon and Laitin (2003).==== Our model shares some similarities with Besley and Persson (2010) who study why weak states are often plagued by civil disorder which reinforce low investments in legal and fiscal capacity.==== In focussing on foreign aid and conflict, our paper relates to Dube and Naidu (2015) who find that US military assistance leads to differential increases in attacks by paramilitaries in Colombia.====Our result concerning poorer districts supplying more effort for the Maoists resonate with Collier, Hoeffler, 1998, Collier, Hoeffler, 2001, Collier, Hoeffler, 2002 who argue that civil wars are essentially driven by poor economic opportunities. Like Dube and Vargas (2013) and Mitra and Ray (2014), we touch upon the “opportunity cost effect” and “rapacity effect” albeit from a slightly different standpoint. Lind et al. (2014) examine the effect of conflict on illegal activities like opium production in the context of Afghanistan. They argue that conflict affects general lawlessness in states where instituions are weak and this induces farmers to switch from foodgrain cultivation to crops (like opium) which may be illegal but provide ready money. Like in our paper, they too focus on how conflict affects incentives.====Our paper shares certain similarities with papers which focus on Nepal, particularly, Do and Iyer (2010), Acharya (2009), Gates and Murshed (2005), Bohara et al. (2006) and Bohara et al. (2011). Acharya (2009) finds geography and the history of political activism to be relevant for violence. Gates and Murshed (2005) find a strong association between the Gini and conflict. Bohara et al. (2011) find strong evidence that greater inequality escalates deadly violence. However, it matters how one measures inequality: polarization turns out to be the more persistent type of inequality causing conflict. Sharma (2006) states that the failure of development efforts in Nepal contributed to a rise in poverty and rural-urban inequality. This, in turn, fueled frustration among the disadvantaged youth in the rural and remote areas, leading to the eruption of the civil war. In sum, these studies provide evidence on variables associated with the origin and escalation of Maoist violence in Nepal; this feature distinguishes them from our work which tries to identify the effects of conflict on resource allocation.====De Juan and Pierskalla (2016) investigate the role of violence in shaping the trust citizens have in their national government. They utilise geo-referenced survey data joined with village level information on civil war casualties to estimate the effects of exposure to violence on political trust in Nepal. They uncover that exposure to violence matters for reducing trust in the national government. Libois (2016) poses a question which is close to ours in some ways. He looks at the short and medium term consequences of the Nepalese civil war on rural households livelihoods and on the inter-group distribution of income. He finds that in the short-run all households lose, but high castes by a larger extent. However, high castes diversify their income sources, notably by relying on migration, which allows them to recover. He does not explore the political-economy mechanism which we seek to emphasize: namely, the strategic role of conflict in diverting resources across districts ====.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We show that it is optimal for the ruling elite to choose leaders with more military experience in a politically unstable regime while more educated leaders are preferred in politically stable regimes. Using a dataset that includes 1569 national leaders from 177 countries over the period 1946–2011, we find empirical evidence that political stability contributes to the selection of more educated leaders, while the reverse holds for leaders with high military ranks. The empirical findings are robust to different subsamples, various proxies for educational and military attainment, and different measures for political stability. Our results suggest that leader selection is another reason why political instability is harmful for economic growth.","Several studies have emphasized the importance of competent political leaders for good economic policy and economic growth. Jones and Olken (2005), for example, show that unexpected leadership changes influence the economic growth path of countries. The importance of the political leader is also emphasized by Besley et al. (2011), who find that the educational background of political leaders is an important determinant of economic growth. Other studies report similar findings and stress the importance of personal characteristics for the willingness to reform economically (Dreher et al., 2009), the type of defense policy (Horowitz and Stam, 2012), or the choice of diplomatic policies (Dreher and Yu, 2019, and Dreher and Jensen, 2013).====Political leaders are not selected randomly. Several models describe the selection and survival of political leaders. For example, the citizen-candidate models of Osborne and Slivinski (1996) and Besley and Coate (1997) describe what type of citizens will run for political selection. Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003)’s selectorate theory model studies the strategic interaction between the incumbent and political challengers. Yu and Jong-A-Pin (2016) introduce heterogenous leaders in the selectorate theory and study the interaction between political leader characteristics and the size of the ruling elite (i.e., the winning coalition). In a similar vein, the relation between the institutional framework and the type of political leaders is analyzed empirically by Besley et al. (2011), who find that it is more likely that well educated politicians are selected in democracies than in autocracies.====In this paper, we focus on heterogeneous leaders and examine leader selection in the context of political instability. That is, we argue that political elites in countries suffering from political instability lack the incentives to select economically competent leaders. As politically unstable countries often find themselves in a so-called coup-trap, where coups are most likely to be followed by another coup d’etat (see Londregan and Poole, 1990), it is in the best interest of political elites to select strong military leaders to protect the position and interests of the elite group. However, according to Yu and Jong-A-Pin (2016), selecting a military competent political leader most often comes at the cost of not selecting an economically competent leader. As such, political elites face a trade-off between rent protection in the short-run and a higher probability of economic growth in the medium to long-run. That is, whereas military competent leaders may possess the ability to appease coup attempts (Jong-A-Pin and Yu, 2010), educational attainment is associated with higher economic growth (Besley et al., 2011). In this paper, we show that when the level of political stability is low, ruling elites sacrifice their long-term economic benefits and rather have a military strong leader than an economically competent one. Consequently, we derive the hypothesis that high political stability leads to the selection of more educated leaders with less military attainment and vice versa.====Our hypothesis is empirically tested using a sample of 1569 political leaders that ruled in the 1946–2011 period. This result is robust to different subsamples, various proxies for educational and military attainment, and different measures for political stability. Our empirical analysis also focuses on the link between political stability and economic growth via leader selection. We analyze random exits of leaders (like Jones and Olken, 2005 and Besley et al., 2011) to examine whether highly educated leaders contribute to economic growth positively and whether the reverse holds for leaders with high military ranks. Our findings confirm earlier work by Besley et al. (2011), whereas we are the first to report results on the (ir)relevance of military attainment for economic growth.====The model and evidence reported in this paper provide an alternative channel why political stability is an important determinant of long-term economic growth. Apart from channels via investment (Benhabib and Rustichini, 1996), economic reform, (Svensson, 1998) and building state capacity (Besley and Persson, 2009), we show that political stability affects economic growth via leader selection, because the stable environment increases the likelihood of the selection of an economically competent leader.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 contains our theoretical model from which we derive our hypothesis. Section 3 discusses data and the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the estimation results, and Section 5 contains a robustness analysis. Section 6 studies the impact of leaders’ personal characteristics on economic growth.

Our results combine the insights of simple labour market and trade models. In countries that trade, relative wages respond inversely to variation in skill supplies, but the response decreases with the degree of openness to trade and is small in very open countries. To reconcile our results with standard estimates of the ","Concern about wage inequalities remains strong in many countries. The income share of the top one percent tends to grab the headlines, but among the “other 99 percent” most of the inequality still reflects differences in wages between workers of different skill levels (Autor, 2014). A commonly suggested policy response is to increase the relative supply of skilled workers by improving access to higher education and training. The hope is that such a supply shift would not only lower the proportion of lower-paid workers but also narrow the gap in wages between the skilled and the less-skilled. However, standard economic models offer differing views on the effects of changes in skill supplies on relative wages in countries open to international trade.====That a larger relative skill supply would narrow the wage gap, to a degree dependent on substitutability between workers with different skills, is predicted by standard models of the labour market. In the simplest Heckscher–Ohlin (HO) trade model, however, wages in an open economy are, as Freeman (1995) put it, “set in Beijing” – pinned down by world prices and trade costs, and insensitive to changes in skill supplies. In more complex models, this difference of predictions is blurred.==== But there remains a basic tension between the labour market logic (a demand curve linking relative wages to skill supplies) and the trade logic (variation in skill supplies absorbed by changes in production structure).====Empirical resolution of this issue has been hindered by a shortage of panel data on wages and skill supplies in a wide spectrum of countries. A big step forward in this respect is the Socio-Economic Accounts of the World Input–Output Database (WIOD, 2013 release), which cover 40 countries during 1995–2009. What these data show at first sight is in the two panels on the left side of Fig. 1, which plots the logged wages of college-educated relative to other workers against their logged relative employment for all the WIOD countries – more information on the variables is in Section 3.====The upper panel 1(a) shows the relationship across countries in levels (after averaging the data over time). There is a clear downward slope, with an elasticity estimated at -0.27 (and consistently between -0.2 and -0.3 in individual years). The lower panel 1(c) shows the relationship across countries in changes. It is confused by outliers, but if we drop Mexico, whose employment data are suspect,==== and the transition countries, whose labour market institutions changed substantially, not least in China====, there is a similar though less significant elasticity of −0.26.====These numerical values are puzzling. Their downward slope is inconsistent with the zero predicted by the simplest HO model, but far less steep than the -0.7 implied by the often-quoted (Katz and Murphy, 1992) aggregate elasticity of substitution of 1.4 between college-educated and other labour in the US.==== Nor is the observed pattern consistent with a more complex (‘multi-cone’) HO model.====A clue to solving the puzzle is presented in the two panels on the right side of Fig. 1, which show separately the slopes for more open countries and less open countries, where ‘more open’ refers to countries in the top third of trade-to-GDP ratios (averaged over time and adjusted for country size, as explained in Section 4), and ‘less open’ to countries in the bottom third. There is a striking difference: in levels (Fig. 1(b)), the downward slope for more open countries (-0.19) is less than half as steep as that for less open countries (-0.42); in changes (Fig. 1(d)), the downward slope for more open countries (a statistically insignificant -0.11) is an even smaller fraction of that for less open countries (-0.58).====The descriptive evidence in Fig. 1 is validated by the more refined estimates in later sections of the paper. We find that relative wages in open economies vary with relative skill supplies, in line with simple labour market models and as Fig. 1(a) and (c) suggest. But we also find that the response of wages to skill supplies is smaller in countries with lower barriers to trade, as Fig. 1(b) and (d) illustrate, and in very open economies comes close to the simple trade economics view that wages are unaffected by skill supplies.====Theoretically, we explain these results by extending Samuelson’s classic formalisation of the HO model to include elements of other models. One such element is the observed price inelasticity of sales and purchases of goods in world markets. A widely accepted explanation of this inelasticity, due to Armington (1969), is qualitative differences – and hence imperfect substitutability – among the varieties produced by different countries (or firms, as in Krugman (1979)) of what trade statistics classify as the same good. An additional, more recent explanation of this inelasticity is differences in efficiency and location among countries (Eaton and Kortum, 2002) and firms (Melitz, 2003).====Because the demand for labour is a derived demand, price inelasticity in the world market for goods creates inelasticity of demand in labour markets and helps to explain why relative wages vary with skill supplies in open economies. If world demand for goods were infinitely elastic, any change in skill supplies might (as in the simplest HO model) be fully absorbed by a change in the country’s relative output of more and less skill-intensive goods, leaving goods prices and thus relative wages unaffected.====Our model includes two additional sources of labour demand inelasticity (drawn from Wood (2012)). First, the goods price elasticities faced by a country’s firms depend also on its degree of openness: the bigger the share of home suppliers in the home market, as a result of higher trade barriers, the more do their sales depend on substitutability among goods, which is lower than substitutability among home and foreign varieties of the same good. Second, components of the relative total costs of different goods that do not vary in proportion to their relative labour costs (capital and materials, most obviously). By attenuating the response of relative prices to changes in relative wages, these other cost components reduce the scope for the output structure to absorb changes in skill supplies.====The relative elasticity of demand for skilled and unskilled workers in an open economy thus depends on all three of these elements – inelasticity of demand for goods in world markets, degree of openness to trade, and the size of costs that do not vary in proportion to labour costs. We set out a model that includes these three elements and provides the basis for our empirical investigation of the responsiveness of relative wages to variation in skill supplies using the WIOD data.====Reduced-form estimation is problematic: observed elasticities of the sort in Fig. 1 are the outcome of several forces, including the three just mentioned, and there is not enough exogenous variation in the data to be able to identify their influence separately. However, we start by using reduced-form methods to check the prima facie consistency of our model with reality. Our results confirm the inverse relationship between the relative wages and relative supplies of skilled and unskilled workers found in many other studies (e.g. Katz and Murphy (1992); Robbins (1996); Blum (2010); Marshall (2012); Morrow and Trefler (2017)). As suggested by our model, moreover, the inverse relationship is weaker where countries are more open to trade and where the ratio of wages to other costs is higher.====These reduced-form inferences are supported by the results of structural estimation of our theoretical model – obtaining numerical values for its parameters and simulating the response of relative wages to the observed variation in relative skill supplies. The simulated changes in relative wages are correlated with actual changes in relative wages, both across countries and within countries over time, and the correlation is increased by incorporating the two novel elements of our model – degree of openness to trade and size of non-proportional non-labour costs.====The structural estimates of our baseline model, however, imply a wage-skill supply elasticity that is much lower (i.e. more negative) than in Fig. 1 and in our reduced-form estimates. The difference can plausibly be explained by adding two other elements to the theoretical framework, drawing on Acemoglu (2007) and Caron et al. (2014). One is directed technical change: increases in the supply of a factor create an incentive to find new ways of using it more productively. The other is that increases in skill supply raise incomes and that the demand for skill-intensive goods is income-elastic. Adding these two elements brings the aggregate elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers implied by our structural results into line with generally accepted estimates of this parameter.====In addition to the work by others already noted, our paper relates and contributes to several areas of the literature. One is the role of variation in the sectoral structure of output in absorbing variation in factor supplies, documented for trade by Romalis (2004) and Chor (2010) and for immigration by Lafortune et al. (2015). That such variation in output requires variation in goods prices is a feature also of Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014), and that price elasticities depend on trade shares is in the spirit of Rodrik (1997).==== Non-proportional costs affect goods prices as in Alchian and Allen (1964) and Hummels and Skiba (2004).====Our paper also fits with studies showing that variation in output structure absorbs only part of the variation in skill supplies (Ciccone, Peri, 2005, Blum, 2010, Lewis, 2013), with the rest absorbed by variation in skill intensity (Davis, Weinstein, 2001, Schott, 2003). We combine these two absorption mechanisms in an extension of the “economy-wide elasticity of substitution” of Jones (1965).====Our paper complements studies of variation in relative wages across countries for reasons other than variation in their skill supplies, including labour market institutions, technology (Levchenko, Zhang, 2016, Morrow, Trefler, 2017), and market size (Epifani and Gancia, 2006). It also complements studies of the various ways in which openness can make a country’s relative wages higher or lower than would be expected from its skill supply (e.g. Wood (2002); Epifani and Gancia (2008); Harrison et al. (2011); Parro (2013); Burstein and Vogel (2017)).====The rest of the paper is organised as follows.

Using a large data-set on bilateral skill-specific migration and a flexible novel identification strategy, the functionally flexible impact of different levels of skilled and unskilled immigration on the volume and structure of bilateral imports is identified in a quasi-experimental design. We find evidence of a polarized impact of skill-specific immigration on imports: highly concentrated skilled or unskilled immigrants induce higher import volumes than a balanced composition of the immigrant base. This effect turns out particularly important when institutions are weak. Regarding the structure of imports, we observe that skilled immigrants specifically add to imports in differentiated goods. Both bits of evidence are consistent with a segregation of skill-specific immigrant networks and corresponding trade patterns.","Immigration may affect trade and, in particular, imports for various reasons, of which the transaction-cost channel and the preference channel are the most prominent ones.==== Empirical work on the role of bilateral immigration for bilateral trade typically relies on three paradigms (see Gaston, Nelson, 2011, Parsons, Winters, 2014; and Felbermayr et al., 2015; for surveys of that literature): (i) that the skill structure of migration matters for the impact on trade====; (ii) that the functional form of the impact of migration on trade is linear or log-linear====; and (iii) that migration is endogenous even conditional on a linear function of other determinants of bilateral trade.==== The argument in (i) results in a heterogeneous impact of migration on trade, depending on the skill-specific composition of migration, and this impact heterogeneity is masked when using total instead of skill-specific immigration variables in explaining trade. A violation of (ii) would mean that the estimates of the trade response to migration might be meaningless to the extent that marginal changes in migration might have largely different effects on trade, depending on the level of migration in the outset. And the argument in (iii) entails that bilateral migration is not exogenous conditional on a linear function of the control variables, leading to inconsistent estimates of the relationship between migration and trade. Inter alia but not only, the latter results from a non-log-linear impact of these covariates on trade in general (see Anderson, van Wincoop, 2003, Santos Silva, Tenreyro, 2006) and a non-log-linear impact of migration on trade in particular.====This paper aims at considering the heterogeneity of the impact of skilled versus unskilled migration, the flexible nonlinearity of that relationship, and the endogeneity of each of migration by skill type through employing an econometric approach which permits considering a flexible impact of skill-specific migration on trade. This is done on the basis of a so-called generalized propensity score (GPS) framework for continuous endogenous variables (treatments; skill-specific bilateral immigration in our case) and continuous outcome (bilateral imports).====Exploiting this flexibility and using two large cross sections of bilateral stocks of skilled and unskilled immigrants and bilateral import flows for 1990 and 2000, respectively, we are able to provide novel evidence on the effect of skill-specific immigration on bilateral imports. In particular, the findings suggest that a concentration on skilled or unskilled immigrants leads to a bigger response of bilateral imports than a mixed composition of the same level of total immigration. We place this ==== at the door of ====. Hence, we interpret the findings as implicit evidence for the stronger bonding – and associated effects on trade – of networks of migrants of the same skill type.==== Moreover, an improvement of the institutional quality in a migrant’s origin country displays the biggest positive effect on bilateral imports if, at the same time, the mix of immigrants is skill-wise relatively balanced.====We rationalize these findings in a number of ways, but they are consistent, in particular, with the presence of (at least partially) segmented skilled and unskilled migration networks and their effectiveness for trade in different domains of goods. Finally, the nonlinear impact of the two types of immigration on import volume and specific categories thereof suggests that the insights gained in this paper could not easily be derived in the framework of log-linear gravity equations as often used to analyze bilateral migration stocks or flows.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the concept of GPS estimation with multiple (or multivariate) treatments for inference of the impact of skilled versus unskilled immigration on bilateral imports. Section 3 introduces the data used for inferences and associated descriptive statistics. Section 4 summarizes the results regarding the causal impact of bilateral skilled versus unskilled immigration on bilateral international imports, including an analysis on the structure of imports and Section 5 provides a rationalization of those findings against the background of economic theory and earlier research on the nexus between migration and trade.

I argue that a central function of these rules in many religious communities is to promote altruistic and cooperative behavior ,"Religion is one of the most important institutions in nearly all human societies. One way in which religious institutions affect economic outcomes is by imposing rules that affect religious community members’ behavior. In this paper, I study the function and effects of these religious rules.====I argue that one of the main functions of many religious rules is to promote altruistic and cooperative behavior ====. According to my argument, religious rules complement and strengthen biological altruistic ties, generating levels of cooperation within families that are higher than would be expected on the basis of biological altruism alone. This function of religion is illustrated by the fifth commandment, “Honor thy father and thy mother,” which directs children to behave more altruistically towards their parents. It is also illustrated by religious movements such as modern evangelical Protestantism that promote “family values” by imposing rules such as bans on abortion that affect family relationships.====My argument contrasts with the now standard view of religious rules in the literature, that the primary economic function of religious rules is to promote altruism and cooperation ====. The classic statement of this argument in economics is the club goods model of religion, developed by Iannaccone (1992). Iannaccone focuses on seemingly irrational religious rules, such as prohibitions against eating certain foods or working on certain days of the week, and he argues that these seemingly irrational rules promote cooperation between unrelated religious community members.==== On this view, religious institutions substitute for biological altruism by helping to create relationships between unrelated individuals that mimic biologically altruistic relationships. This function of religion is illustrated by the Christian admonishment, “Love thy neighbor as thyself,” which directs people to behave more altruistically towards other unrelated members of the community. It is also illustrated by religious movements that focus on community solidarity and support for the poor, such as Catholic liberation theology, and by cooperative religious communes such as monasteries. It is interesting to note that organizations like monasteries often impose explicit anti-family rules, such as the requirement that members be celibate, in order to increase members’ commitment to the community. This observation shows that promoting cooperation within families and promoting cooperation between unrelated community members are distinct and sometimes conflicting goals. However, it is also possible for religious communities to promote both goals simultaneously.====More generally, I argue that religious communities exist on a spectrum, with some communities being more concerned with promoting cooperation within families and other communities being more concerned with promoting cooperation between unrelated community members. Most religious communities are at least partially concerned with promoting both goals to some extent. Thus, I do not argue that club goods model is incorrect as a description of most religious communities. Instead, I argue that the club goods model is incomplete, since it fails to explain the interaction between religious rules and family life. My theory explains a variety of phenomena associated with religion that are not explained by the club goods model.====I develop my argument in the context of one unusual religious community, the Amish. One of the most distinctive features of Amish society is the many seemingly irrational rules that Amish communities impose on their members, such as rules forbidding members from driving cars, using electricity from the grid, or attending school past the age of fourteen. Amish communities also impose a punishment, called shunning, on children who leave the community to avoid following the rules. I argue that a primary purpose of Amish rules is to encourage children to allocate their time according to their parents’ preferences by reducing the productivity of other uses of time such as wage work or private leisure. Thus, Amish rules effectively increase the level of children’s altruistic and cooperative behavior towards parents. Parents have political control over the community, and they use their control to impose these rules to benefit themselves at the expense of their children. Amish parents then impose punishments on children who leave the community in order to force children to remain and to follow the rules. This could mean, for example, that Amish children allocate more time towards caring for their parents in old age instead of working for wages or enjoying private leisure activities. It could also mean that Amish children allocate more time towards raising their own children (their parents’ grandchildren).====I use my model to explain a number of facts about Amish institutions. One set of facts that my model can explain are selection patterns into Amish communities. Using a novel data set covering nearly the entire Amish population of Holmes County, Ohio, over more than 20 years, I establish two results. First, the severity of the punishment of shunning imposed on children who leave the church varies across Amish communities. I show that children are less likely to leave Amish communities that practice stricter forms of shunning, even after controlling for other observable factors, and that the association between shunning and the probability of exit is very strong. This suggests that a central purpose of shunning is to prevent children from leaving the community, as predicted by my theory. Second, I show that children of richer Amish parents are more likely to remain in the church than children of poorer Amish parents. My explanation of this result is that because parents want their children to remain in the church, parents use their resources to influence their children’s religious choice, for example by threatening to disinherit children who leave the church. The fact that parents use their resources to affect whether their children join the church illustrates the conflict of interest between parents and children about whether children should join the church.====My model can also explain the persistence of Amish church membership across generations, and persistent inequality between the Amish and their non-Amish neighbors. Amish church membership has been transmitted from parents to children for more than three hundred years. At the same time, Amish families remain persistently poorer than their non-Amish neighbors, in large part because Amish community rules reduce economic productivity. Not only are the Amish poorer than their neighbors, but they appear to have lower overall welfare, as evidenced by relatively high exit rates of Amish children born into communities that do not impose severe punishments on children who leave. In my model, community punishments for children who leave the church are the key to explaining both the transmission of Amish church membership across generations and persistent wealth and welfare inequality between the Amish and the non-Amish. Amish community punishments force children to remain in the church when they would have preferred to leave. When the children become parents themselves, they impose the same punishments on their children, explaining transmission of church membership across multiple generations. Family dynasties that initially belong to the Amish church are persistently poorer than other dynasties even after many generations, because Amish rules reduce children’s productivity and welfare. If the costs that Amish rules impose on children outweigh the benefits to parents, the Amish can be persistently disadvantaged relative to the non-Amish in lifetime welfare, even after accounting for the benefits that Amish rules create for Amish parents.====Finally, my model can explain the extremely high Amish fertility rate. The fertility rate among the Amish is nearly eight births per woman. In my model, Amish rules encourage Amish community members to spend more time than they otherwise would on family activities such as child raising, which may help to explain the high Amish fertility rate.====In the main version of my model, I assume that rules encouraging Amish community members to spend more time raising children primarily increase the quantity, rather than the quality, of Amish children. This assumption is consistent with the high Amish fertility rate and the low level of Amish investment in children’s schooling. An alternative assumption is that religious rules encourage religious community members to invest more in child quality, rather than child quantity. In this case, members of strict religious communities may be persistently wealthier and better educated than non-members. This possibility may help to explain religious communities with persistently high levels of human capital such as non-ultra-Orthodox Jews (Botticini and Eckstein, 2012) and German Protestants (Becker and Woessmann, 2009)====It is possible to think of alternative explanations for each of the facts described above, taken individually. However, I believe that it is difficult to find a model of comparable simplicity and generality that explains all of the facts about Amish institutions. I now discuss the main alternative theories, and argue that they each fail to explain some or all of the facts about Amish institutions. I begin with the club goods model.====In the club goods model, the purpose of religious rules is not to encourage members to spend more time with their families, but rather to encourage members to spend more time on activities that benefit the entire community, such as organizing community events or engaging in charitable activities. The club goods model is probably part of the explanation for Amish institutions, as there are in fact high levels of cooperation between unrelated members of Amish communities. However, the club goods cannot be the whole explanation of Amish institutions, because it has difficulty explaining the facts described above. I discuss five ways in which Amish institutions are hard to explain in the club goods model.====First, the club goods model predicts that strict religious communities should impose punishments on people who ==== the community, as a way of screening ==== prospective members who do not share community values and who are less likely to contribute to community club goods. This prediction is developed in more detail by Berman (2000). This prediction contrasts with my finding that Amish communities impose punishments on children who ==== in order to screen children ==== the community.====Second, Iannaccone argues that benefits of cooperation within strict religious communities, such as mutual insurance, are relatively more valuable to the poor, and that the poor should therefore be more likely to join strict religious communities. This argument is developed by Abramitzky (2008), who shows people with less human capital are more likely to remain members of Israeli kibbutzim. This prediction contrasts with my finding that children of richer Amish parents are more likely to remain in the Amish church.====Third, the club goods model does not explain the persistence of Amish church membership across generations. Since the club goods model has no intergenerational component, taken literally it implies that children of Amish parents should be no more likely to join the Amish church or other similarly strict religious communities than children from secular families with similar levels of wealth and human capital. However, it is clear that Amish children are more likely to join the Amish church than secular children are to join similarly strict religious communities, even after controlling for wealth and human capital endowments.====Fourth, the club goods model has difficulty explaining how religious institutions could persistently reduce their members’ welfare. The club goods model implies that the community services provided by strict religious communities make members better off than non-members. This prediction is hard to reconcile with the persistently lower welfare of the Amish, as evidenced by high exit rates from Amish communities that do not impose punishments on children who leave.====Fifth, my model provides a more compelling explanation for high Amish fertility than the extension of the club goods model developed by Berman (2000). Berman argues that ultra-Orthodox Jews have high fertility rates because community rules reduce wages and hence the opportunity cost of time, especially for ultra-Orthodox women. While this is likely part of the explanation for high ultra-Orthodox fertility rates, it seeems incomplete because the ultra-Orthodox fertility rate appears to be much higher than the fertility rate even among poor secular Israelis who face comparable wages. I argue that rules among groups like the Amish and the ultra-Orthodox not only reduce the productivity of wage work, but are also aimed explicitly at increasing the amount of time devoted to family activities such as raising children. This dual effect may increase the fertility rate above the fertility rate in secular populations with comparably low wages.====Other models of religion and culture emphasize the role of religion and culture in determining people’s preferences or beliefs, rather than the material rules and regulations imposed by religious institutions. Bisin, Verdier, 2000, Bisin, Verdier, 2001 argue that parents have a preference that their children join the same religion, and that parents expend resources to instil this preference in their children. Kuran and Sandholm (2008) argue that people tend to adapt their preferences to fit both their own actions and the actions taken by the other members of their communities. Giuliano and Nunn (2019) argue that children acquire their parents’ culture by imitating their parents’ behavioral rules of thumb. All of these models are designed to explain the persistence of cultural traits such as religious affiliation across generations, and so they can help to explain the persistence of Amish church membership. With suitable modification, these models may be able to explain why children of richer Amish parents are more likely to remain Amish than children of poorer Amish parents. However, none of these models can explain the particular form of Amish rules and institutions, or the purpose of these rules. The only possible explanation for seemingly irrational rules in these models is that the rules were a rational response to environmental conditions at some point in the past, and that the rules were then transmitted culturally across generations even as the environment changed. In contrast, my model explains how seemingly irrational Amish rules in fact serve a rational purpose in the present, thereby explaining why Amish rules take the particular form that they do.====Carvalho and Koyama (2016), and Carvalho et al. (2017), also construct models in which religion is both a social and political institution that imposes rules on its members, and a cultural practice that is transmitted across generations. These models do not emphasize the role of community punishments in maintaining religious communities, although it would be easy to extend the models to include community punishments. Suitably modified, these models may be able to generate empirical predictions that are similar to mine. An advantage of my model relative to these other models is theoretical parsimony. My model explains both the political structure of Amish communities and the transmission of Amish religious affiliation across generations as a result of parents’ desire to control their children’s behavior. My model does not require the additional assumption that parents have an intrinsic preference that their children remain Amish for “identity” reasons (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000). In contrast, in Carvalho and Koyama (2016) religious rules are chosen by a “religious authority” whose preferences are distinct from the preferences of any other member of the community. Carvalho and Koyama do not explain how an agent with these preferences could be chosen to lead the community, and so they do not explain why the religious community has the political structure that it does. In Carvalho et al. (2017), the results are driven by the assumption that people have intrinsic “identity” preferences. Again, it is not explained why people have these preferences, in contrast to my model in which parents’ reduced form preference that their children remain in the Amish church is given a deeper microfoundation.====The Amish are a small and esoteric community, and it may seem that my model does not have much applicability beyond this unusual context. I argue, however, that many other religious and cultural communities have features similar to the Amish, if perhaps not to the same degree. Many religious and cultural communities impose rules that are meant to regulate family life, such as rules about proper gender roles, courtship and marriage, and child raising practices. Many religious and cultural communities also impose penalties on children who leave. For example, the traditional punishment in Islam for apostasy, conversion from Islam to another religion, is death (see Friedmann, 2003 for discussion of punishments for apostasy in Islam). Similarly, Kymlicka (1995) argues that communal property ownership in some minority cultural communities makes it difficult for children to assimilate into the majority by preventing children from taking property with them when they leave. I believe that my model is useful for understanding these other religious and cultural communities and hence has broader significance. In particular, my model may help to explain both how religious and cultural minority communities can persist, and how these communities can be persistently disadvantaged relative to the majority.====More positively, my theory suggests that religious institutions may help to strengthen family ties, which may increase investment in children’s human capital. The declining strength of family ties and the resulting decrease in investment in children’s human capital is a serious problem (Heckman, 2011, Lundberg, Pollak, Stearns, 2016), and promoting religion may help to prevent or reverse this trend. This possible positive effect of religion seems to apply more strongly to religious communities like non-ultra-Orthodox Jews that promote investment in child quality, unlike the Amish who seem to promote investment primarily in child quantity.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In practice, it is conducted by both the public sector (mainly colleges) and the private sector (mainly firms). Over the last two decades, many countries have been expanding the scope of public research.==== Policymakers who support the expansion emphasize that new knowledge, once created by public research, complements private investment in R&D. Those against the expansion are concerned that since the supply of the key innovation input, scientific personnel (generally scientists, researchers, and engineers) is inelastic,==== the expansion of public research may crowd out private research by driving up the wage of scientific personnel and reallocating them away from private sectors (David and Hall, 2000; David et al., 2000).====China's massive college expansion since 1999 and labor market segmentation provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate such a reallocation effect. This college expansion was largely driven by changes in national policies and its scale was by any standard dramatic. In 1998, the number of enrolled college students was 3.4 million; in 2007 (the end of our sample period), it had surged to 18.8 million, increasing by 4.5 times from 1998. Meanwhile, the number of college teachers increased substantially from 0.41 million to 1.2 million, increasing by 1.9 times. Both college teachers and industrial scientific personnel generally come from the same pool of individuals with master's or Ph.D. degrees. Therefore, such a dramatic increase in college teachers implies a nontrivial level of scientific personnel reallocating from industries to colleges.====When scientific labor markets are integrated, it is more likely that such a reallocation takes the form of researchers migrating across cities instead of researchers switching jobs within a city. Therefore, its negative effect on firm innovation spreads nationwide and can hardly be identified through cross-city comparisons. In China, migration from one city to another is subject to substantial restrictions due to the ==== system (Chan, 2009). These restrictions make the migration cost easily outweigh the potential benefit from regional wage differentials. Consequently, regional scientific personnel markets are somewhat segmented and even their ==== supply is inelastic in China. We thus expect that the negative reallocation effect on firm innovation stays local in China and thus may be captured through cross-city comparisons.====Our firm-level data come from the Annual Survey of Industrial Enterprises (ASIE) conducted by China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). This data set is becoming one of the most important sources to study innovation activities of Chinese industrial firms. Recent applications include Chen et al. (2017), Hu et al. (2017), Rong et al. (2016), Hu et al. (2005), and etc.====To estimate the effect of college expansion on firm innovation, we exploit the variations in city-level teacher density (i.e., number of college teachers normalized by city population) as shocks to local firms’ innovation propensities for the period 2001–2007, which fell in the college expansion period. The change in teacher density measures the extent of scientific personnel reallocation due to college expansion. A firm's innovation propensity is measured by its innovation input (R&D expenditures) and innovation output (new product output).====To mitigate the potential endogeneity caused by regional omitted variables and reverse causality, we not only use one-year lagged teacher density and control for city (firm) fixed effects but also apply the IV (Instrument Variable) approach. Increasing enrolled college students are the major reason for colleges hiring more college teachers. However, the realized enrollment may not be a qualified instrument for the number of college teachers because it is also part of the equilibrium outcome and thus endogenous to changes in the local economy. Alternatively, we use ==== student density (i.e., predicted number of enrolled college students normalized by city population) as the instrument for teacher density. Specifically, we use the factors that are related to the national-level college expansion and a city's initial status to compute its predicted student density. We tend to believe that these factors are plausibly exogenous to any individual firms’ subsequent innovation decisions.====Both OLS and IV regressions show that one-year lagged teacher density imposed a negative effect on firms’ innovation propensities. Moreover, this negative effect is significant both at the extensive margin (measured by probability of having R&D expenditures or probability of having new products) and at the intensive margin (measured by ratio of R&D expenditures over total output or ratio of new product output over total output). Regarding a city's overall innovation output, we find that an increase in the number of college teachers was followed by a significant decrease in the number of invention patents in the city, suggesting that scientific personnel became less productive in innovation after reallocating away from firms to colleges.====Though the above results are consistent with our main hypothesis of scientific personnel reallocation, there exist alternative explanations.==== Direct evidence on the reallocation of scientific personnel driven by the college expansion is thus required to further confirm our main hypothesis. By using individual-level data from the Urban Household Survey (UHS) conducted by the NBS, we further estimate how the college expansion affected job choices of highly educated (i.e., college degree or above) laborers. Our IV estimations show that the college expansion made highly educated laborers less likely to choose industrial jobs, which is consistent with our reallocation story.====However, such a negative relationship is also consistent with a substitution story, which emphasizes that the expansion of public research reduces the benefits of private research and thus induces firms to hire fewer researchers. The substitution story predicts a decreasing demand and thus a lower wage of researchers associated with the college expansion. Whereas, our story predicts an increasing demand and thus a higher wage. Consistent with our story, we find that when the college expansion was more intensive, highly educated industrial workers enjoyed a higher wage premium when holding a professional (research-related) job.====Our paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, our paper highlights the important role that the scientific labor market plays in the effect of public research expansion on firm innovation, as proposed by Goolsbee (1998) and David and Hall (2000). Consistent with Goolsbee's (1998) finding that federal R&D spending raises the wage for researchers, we find that the relative wage for researchers was higher when college expansion was more intensive. Furthermore, we are able to provide direct evidence that college expansion was associated with scientific personnel reallocating away from industries, thanks to labor market segmentation in China. When regional labor markets are integrated, the reallocation takes the form of scientific personnel migrating across regions. In this aspect, our finding echoes Aghion et al. (2009), who find migration across states plays an important role in the positive effect of higher-education investment on economic growth, and Wilson (2009), who shows that in the U.S. the enforcement of R&D tax credits in a state stimulates its own private R&D expenditures but reduce those in other states.====Second, our paper is closely related to the literature about the effect of college activities on private research.==== We exploit a large-scale natural experiment to address the endogeneity problem of college activities. This identification strategy is similar to Andersson et al., 2004, Andersson et al., 2009 and Cowan and Zinovyeva (2013), who exploit policy-driven college expansion in Sweden and Italy, respectively.==== Differently, we are among the first to examine the issue in an emerging economy. In addition, we find a negative effect of college expansion on regional innovation, while they, similar to most previous studies, find a positive effect.==== This difference can be justified by the different extent of labor market segmentation. Unlike China, the labor market in developed countries is highly integrated. The negative reallocation effect of college expansion on innovation thus spreads nationwide. In this regard, our study is more like cross-country studies, in which the assumption of labor market segmentation is better satisfied. Indeed, some of these studies have found a negative effect of public research on private research (see, for example, Guellec and De La Potterie, 2003).====Last, our paper is also related to the literature about the effect of college expansion on college wage premium. Consistent with the aspect that colleges are suppliers of highly educated laborers, studies have documented that this effect is negative both in the U.S. (Fortin, 2006; Carneiro and Lee, 2011) and in China (Meng et al., 2014). Our paper suggests that such a wage effect can be heterogeneous when taking into account that colleges are also consumers of highly educated laborers.==== Specifically, we provide evidence for the demand-side story by finding that China's college expansion drove up relative wages for professional jobs.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the background of China's college expansion. Section III formalizes the hypotheses. Section IV analyzes the effect of college expansion on firm innovation. Section V analyzes the effect of college expansion on city-level patenting.

We randomized the ethnic identities of job applicants, their academic merit, and requested salaries. Our results show that a Muslim job seeker is more than 50% less likely to receive a callback than a Han job seeker, and higher academic merit does not compensate for this bias.

Interview evidence suggests that besides productivity concerns and outright hostility towards outgroups, bias is also driven by employer concerns over the operational costs of accommodating a diverse workforce.","Ethnic violence in China, particularly between the majority Han Chinese and the Uyghur Muslims, has increased in frequency and severity since the late 1980s (Cao, Duan, Liu, Piazza, Wei, 2018, Hou, 2018). Many argue that prejudice and discrimination against minorities and ethnic-others increases grievances and fuels violence (Choi and Bowles 2007). Discrimination is prevalent in the Chinese labor market, where Muslim job seekers find it difficult to get a job. They are particularly at a disadvantage when it comes to securing high-wage and skilled jobs in cities (Hasmath, 2011, Zhou, Wong, 2019).==== Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim group, for instance, have a population of 10.1 million==== and about 80% are farmers, a number much higher than the national average of 49% (Simpson 2015). Integration in the labor market is both important for individual wellbeing and for social stability. Prolonged unemployment could lead to various undesirable outcomes such as decreased levels of life satisfaction (Clark et al. 2008) and higher tendencies to commit crime (Fougere, Kramarz, Pouget, 2009, Raphael, Rudolf, 2001). According to an internal report, during the July 2009 Urumqi riots in Western China, Uyghur rioters were mainly unemployed young men who recently migrated from Southern Xinjiang and who were consistently excluded from the more profitable industries (Hopper, Webber, 2009, Xu, Wang, 2009).====It is well documented that Chinese employers are less likely to hire a minority applicant, even given comparable level of credentials (Maurer-Fazio, 2012, Zang, 2012). The government openly acknowledges the existence of this discrimination in its official policy document, bundling “ethnic minority laborers” together with the disabled, retired athletes, ex-criminals, and the rehabilitated as groups of job seekers facing discrimination and needing extra help in the labor market.==== According to the Chinese College Student Survey (Jia and Li 2017), Han college graduates on average receive more interview invitations, more job offers, and higher initial monthly wages than their ethnic minority peers.====In part as a reaction to this well documented bias, the Chinese government has made notable efforts to create job opportunities for Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in certain sectors. For example, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been encouraged to hire ethnic minority college graduates, especially those originally from Xinjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai, all of which have a high concentration of ethnic minority populations.==== One such effort by the state to encourage minority hiring is career fairs that target college graduates from these regions.==== Another local-level policy implemented in the 1980s known as the Xinjiang Six Principles set a 60% quota for job admissions (Wu and Song 2014, 162),==== although this quota has not been strictly implemented (Li 2015). Yet in Xinjiang, during the SOE reform in the 1990s, Uyghur workers were fired at a higher rate compared to their Han colleagues (Bovingdon 2014, 438).====Do political mandates and interventions offset biases in the labor market? There is mixed evidence in the existing literature. One study that looks at a city in Xinjiang finds that the Han-Uyghur pay gap is smaller among SOE firms, suggesting that SOEs might have been trying to correct some ethnic biases (Zang 2012). Another study finds that the ethnic pay gap is larger in sectors where the marketization level is high, but is negligible within government and public institutions, suggesting that state has an effective role in mitigating such bias (Wu and Song 2014). Other studies show that state policy alone is not enough to correct inveterate biases in the labor market. One study finds that very few job seekers, either Han or Uyghur, rely on the help of the state to get a job (Howell and Fan 2011).====Do ethnic minorities still face discrimination, even if they appear as qualified as their Han competitors? Are SOEs more likely to hire ethnic minority applicants than private companies, given the political mandate to promote diversity? The above-mentioned studies are mostly observational and only provide correlational evidence, which makes it difficult to tease out the effect of ethnic identity alone on various labor market outcomes (with the exception of Maurer-Fazio 2012). We are keen to find out whether there is a causal effect of one’s ethnic identity on their successes on the Chinese labor market, and whether state initiatives helps increase diversity and eliminate bias. Following the classic design in Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), we conduct an audit experiment, submitting fictitious but realistic resumes to job postings in major cities from one of the largest online job boards in China. We compare the callback rates of Han and Muslim (Hui and Uyghur) male job seekers who are otherwise identical in their credentials.==== We further compare callback rates and measure bias in different types of firms to understand whether firm ownership affects labor market decision making.====We find that Chinese firms discriminate against Muslim job seekers, even if a Muslim candidate appears to have similar qualifications to his Han competitors. This finding suggests that besides productivity concerns, there could exist “outright hostility” against minority groups in the labor market (Teele et al. 2018). Counter to our expectations, state-owned firms are no more likely to extend an interview to Muslim candidates than private firms despite strong state mandate. Few experimental studies have explored the effectiveness of government labor market interventions, and we are one of the first to show that government intervention alone is not likely to correct the deep-rooted bias in the Chinese labor market. Qualitative evidence suggests that there exist burdensome administrative and operational costs to diversity. For instance, firms in certain areas are required to go through special registration procedures and report to public security bureaus regularly if they were to hire Uyghur workers (Martina 2014). Further, some firms do not have the capacity and resources to provide halal (====) food for their Muslim workers. These reasons are not directly related to taste-based preferences against a specific group, but they could be used by firms to mask their underlying prejudice.",Anti-muslim bias in the Chinese labor market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596719301015,20 December 2019,2019,Research Article,182.0

We use data from 163 villages of 12 main Indian states to explore whether requiring that village leadership positions be held by women (political reservation) affected uptake of economic opportunities via the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Reservation triggered increases in women's demand for work, program participation, and access to ==== that were sustained beyond the period of female political leadership. Enhanced female participation in program oversight, civic engagement, and electoral participation are plausible channels for such effects and political and economic empowerment seem to be complementary.","India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) is the largest workfare program globally and one of the government's main efforts to reduce the vulnerability of poor people to shocks, directly by paying them wages and indirectly by creating productive local assets. An impressive array of studies has found that NREGS has had positive and far-reaching impacts: The program improved wages especially for women (Azam, 2012) and in the dry season (Imbert and Papp, 2015); it also increased consumption by the poor (Bose, 2017) and reduced short-term migration (Imbert and Papp, 2015). Access to predictable income allowed beneficiaries to choose income generation strategies that had higher risk-return profiles (Gehrke, 2017). Beyond direct program impacts, spillover effects were significant (Muralidharan et al., 2017).====Yet the literature also suggests that the generally positive performance hides considerable heterogeneity of subnational outcomes (Sukhtankar, 2016). Much of the evidence of positive NREGS impact on access to economic opportunities and female empowerment is from states with good governance and strong institutions that often put in place additional controls, e.g., use of electronic payments (Muralidharan et al., 2016) or social audits (Afridi and Iversen, 2014). In underperforming states, leakage and rationing often undermined the program's effectiveness, as in Orissa where corrupt schemes ensured that 75–80% of total program cost went to ‘ghost workers’ (Paul Niehaus and Sukhtankar, 2013). Rationing at both national (Desai et al., 2015) and state (Ravallion et al., 2015) levels has been pervasive. Part of the variation in performance can be attributed to political factors that affect NREGS funding patterns in states (Chopra, 2015) and districts (Gupta and Mukhopadhyay, 2016). At the same time, villages have enormous discretion about such aspects of their NRGES programs as publicity, identification of potential beneficiaries, worker selection, work scheduling, monitoring, ensuring payment, and budgeting. This implies that the quality type of local leadership could affect the success of the program, its economic impact, and, if effects are sustained over time, long-term welfare.====This paper explores whether empowering women politically by random reservation of leadership positions in the ==== (village council) increases women's workfare participation and thus improves their economic outcomes and well-being. We also explore whether the monetary and nonmonetary benefits from NREGS employment enhance women's political participation through involvement in NREGS governance structures like social audits and voicing concerns in local decision-making bodies. Our analysis is inspired by studies on the longer-term impact of reserving village leadership positions for women in terms of providing goods they value (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004), improving the quality of service delivery (Bhalotra and Clots-Figueras, 2014); breaking gendered stereotypes (Beaman et al., 2012); contributing to lasting changes in deep-rooted social norms regarding domestic violence (Iyer et al., 2012); and the status of girls compared to boys (Kalsi, 2017).====We trace individual level outcomes beyond the period in which reservation was effective by matching individual data from the Rural Economics and Demographic Survey (REDS) to village reservation history. Doing so allows us to add to the literature in several ways: We show that the effects of reservation differ by gender and are sustained over time. In fact, higher female participation in NREGS due to leadership reservation for women may be at the expense of male involvement in the program. Such effects would be missed if only household data were available. Also, most effects persist beyond the immediate reserved period as point estimates for effects are often higher than in the reserved period. For example, past reservation increased women's participation in NREGS by more than 50% and doubled the share of women opening bank accounts.====Moreover, detailed data on program implementation allow us to show that, beyond expanding women's participation in NREGS, their leadership, possibly reinforced by the resources and social skills women acquired through economic empowerment, triggered more involvement of women not only in NREGS governance through social audits but also their civic and political engagement generally. Having been exposed to reservation in the past almost eliminated the need to bribe officials to participate in the program. Well beyond what could be explained by incumbency effects, the share of women candidates for the leadership position in non-reserved villages was 55% if the villages had previously been reserved but just 14% if they had not.====The fact that most studies focus on individual states -often high performers that invested in technology to increase NREGS transparency- could raise concerns about results being biased upward or having limited external validity. Our sample covers 12 states spread over the entire nation, thus allaying such concerns. As tests also reject the notion of female leadership having affected local council budget envelopes, the share of resources spent on capital vs. labor, wage rates, or the share of households with job cards, we can be more confident that it is indeed female leadership rather than changes in the program that drive our results.====In what follows, Sections 2 and 3 provides institutional background and reviews the literature on impacts of political reservation, the genesis and impact of India's NREGS, and our empirical strategy. Section 4 describes data and descriptive evidence as well as results from household regressions on NREGS participation. Section 5 presents the results from gender-differentiated regressions to assess the effects of current or past reservation on program access, use, and participation in governance and discusses potential mechanisms as well as robustness checks.

Using firm-level data from Ukraine, this paper provides a granular empirical investigation to disentangle the impact of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) on private firm investment in Ukraine—a large transition economy. Controlling for firm characteristics and systematic differences across sectors, the results indicate that the SOE concentration in a given sector has a statistically significant negative effect on private fixed capital formation, and that the impact of SOEs is stronger in those ==== in which SOEs have a more dominant presence. These findings imply that private firms operating in sectors with a high level of SOE concentration invest systematically less than businesses that are not competing directly with SOEs.","One of the richest strands of the economic literature focuses on the impact of fiscal policy on economic outcomes. At the macroeconomic level, the relationship between government spending and growth can theoretically occur in either direction. While an increase in government spending might bring about a decline in private consumption and investment due to a negative wealth effect and higher interest rates, it could also lead to a rise in private consumption and investment because of higher disposable income and an increase in the expected return to capital (Aiyagari et al., 1990; Barro, 1990, Barro, 1991; Christiano and Eichenbaum, 1992; Baxter and King, 1993; Alesina and Perotti, 1997; Blanchard and Perotti, 2002). The theoretical ambiguity surrounding the effects of government spending on the private sector makes this an ideal empirical inquiry. Still, empirical studies at the macroeconomic level yield a wide range of mixed results. Focusing on the United States over the period 1949–1985, Aschauer (1989) finds that public investment, especially on infrastructure, has a crowding-in effect on private investment by increasing productivity. Similarly, adopting a cross-country approach, Greene and Villanueva (1991), Easterly and Rebelo (1993), Erenburg and Wohart (1995), and Erden and Holcombe (2005) conclude that public investment has an enabling effect on private capital accumulation, especially in developing countries. Other studies, however, reach contradictory results indicating that public spending tends to crowd out private investment (Serven, 1996; Mamatzakis, 2001; Voss, 2002; Narayan, 2004; Mitra, 2006; Cavallo and Daude, 2011; Kim and Nguyen, 2019).====Most empirical studies investigating the relationship between public and private investment at the macroeconomic level, however, miss heterogeneity across sectors and firms, especially in a country where state-owned enterprises (SOEs) account for a substantial proportion of employment and output. SOEs may negatively affect competition and influence the performance and investment appetite of private firms operating in the same sector through having preferential access to government contracts and guarantees and credit and other financial services and benefiting from direct financial support in the form of grants and subsidies and regulatory exemptions from antitrust enforcement and bankruptcy procedures. Furthermore, SOEs may gain from information asymmetries by having access to data that is not available to private enterprises (Serven, 1996; Majumdar, 2009).====The motivation of this study is therefore to examine the impact of SOEs on the investment behavior of private enterprises using a large firm-level dataset covering 84 nonfinancial sectors of the Ukrainian economy over the period 1997–2016. There is only a handful of papers utilizing firm-level data in this context and most conclude that the greater concentration of SOEs tend to lower private investment in countries such as China, Côte d'Ivoire, Malaysia and Vietnam (Harrison and McMillan, 2003; Van Thang and Freeman, 2009; Xu and Yan, 2014; Menon and Ng, 2017). To the best of my knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate whether SOEs crowd out fixed capital formation by private firms in a large transition economy like Ukraine where the state continues to play a dominant role and thereby provides an ideal environment to test the crowding-out hypothesis. To this end, I use a large-scale dataset 665,391 firms in 84 nonfinancial sectors over the period 1997–2016, and employ alternative approaches to estimate the determinants of fixed investment spending by private firms with a focus on SOE density as an explanatory variable.====Ukraine has undergone economic transition since independence in 1991, bringing the liberalization of prices and markets and the privatization of SOEs. Even so, there is still a large number of SOEs with a sizable presence in Ukraine's economic landscape. Controlling for firm characteristics and systematic differences across sectors, I find that the concentration of SOEs in a given sector—measured by the share in employment or revenues—has a statistically significant negative effect on private fixed investment at the firm level. The economic significance of this crowding-out effect on private enterprises is greater in those sectors in which SOEs have a more dominant presence. These empirical results—robust to alternative methodologies and subsample estimations—indicate that private firms operating in industries with a high level of SOE concentration invest systematically less than businesses that are not competing directly with SOEs.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

With data obtained from a lab in the field experiment and household survey, the findings suggest that imperial history influences savings behaviors today. I find no evidence that economic preferences for risk and time differ across the border, nor that these preferences are culturally transmitted. Rather, imperial history is strongly correlated with current financial access and asset choice, which affect savings accumulation. To confirm the robustness of these findings, I conduct falsification tests that arbitrarily move the border and also rule out several alternative mechanisms, including trust in ====, financial literacy, and migration. I establish the external validity of the field experiment using nationally-representative data, which also suggests that savings legacies have important welfare consequences for the ability to mitigate household shocks. These findings highlight the role of history in under-saving, as well as the reinforcing nature of culture and institutions in shaping contemporary economic outcomes.","Savings is fundamental to economic welfare, yet many of the world’s poor under-save. While several explanations have been posited, the role of history is poorly understood.==== A thriving set of literature confirms that history matters for economic development,==== and throughout Eastern Europe, specifically, several studies suggest that imperial legacies determine contemporary trust preferences (Becker, Boeckh, Hainz, Woessmann, 2016, Grosjean, 2011, Mendelski, Libman, 2014, Karaja, Rubin, 2019), institutional quality (Dimitrova-Grajzl, 2007, Becker, Boeckh, Hainz, Woessmann, 2016), judicial performance (Mendelski and Libman, 2014), financial development (Grosjean, 2011a), belief in democratic ideals (Grosjean, Senik, 2011, Grosfeld, Zhuravskaya, 2015), and transportation infrastructure (Grosfeld and Zhuravskaya, 2015). Less is known, however, about how savings interacts with the larger phenomenon of cultural and institutional persistence.====Historical data suggest that regional disparities in savings existed throughout Eastern Europe as early as the 19th century. Census records from the Habsburg Monarchy show that provinces with longer exposure to Habsburg rule were more financially developed and saved more as a percent of GDP in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Austria, 1914). In Romania specifically, by the early 1900s, regions that were under Habsburg influence had more than twice as many banks than regions that never experienced Habsburg rule (Mendelski and Libman, 2014). This paper elucidates whether these patterns are currently sustained by implementing a lab in the field experiment around an 18th century imperial border in present-day Romania to examine whether people living in former Habsburg regions save more today.====In doing so, I focus on the possible cultural and institutional mechanisms through which savings legacies persist. Theoretical models of savings predict that a primary determinant of savings is economic preferences for risk and time. To the extent that history determines these preferences, either directly or through cultural transmission, long-run persistence in preferences could explain observed differences in savings behaviors. In addition, path dependence in financial development between Habsburg and non-Habsburg areas could affect savings today through the costs it imposes on the ability to save, choice of assets, or both. I provide theoretical intuition to motivate the empirical analysis, which discusses how historical differences in access to financial institutions can lead to savings legacies through reinforcing institutional and cultural channels. In this framework, institutional disparities in financial access during imperial times leads to a preference for formal or informal assets, which then determine the current supply of banks. In this sense, culture and institutions are reinforcing in their effect on contemporary economic outcomes.====The empirical framework employs a spatial regression discontinuity (RD) across the Habsburg imperial border in Suceava County, Romania, using a sample of semi-subsistence farmers. I measure economic preferences for risk and time through experimental games, which are combined with observations on individual, household, and farm characteristics from a household survey. I control for potential differences in unobservables, such as ability, entrepreneurship, and effort, by restricting the sample frame to farmers who recently applied for an EU cash transfer program and received scores within a bandwidth of the cutoff for acceptance. Further, by limiting the sample to a single county within one country, I control for unobservables in local institutions that could affect savings. Balance tests of observable factors that are correlated with savings, such as age, education, agricultural productivity, and wealth, provide no evidence of discontinuous jumps in covariates around the imperial border in this sample, thereby validating the assumptions necessary for the spatial RD (Imbens, Lemieux, 2008, Dell, 2010).====The empirical analysis confirms historical persistence in savings. Farmers living in former Habsburg regions are 18 percentage points more likely to have saved 1000 Lei or more – roughly $300 USD or a month’s salary in Romania – and have accumulated approximately 320 Lei more in savings assets than their non-Habsburg counterparts, a 45 percent increase from average non-Habsburg savings.==== The results are robust to various specifications of the RD polynomial.====Turning to the mechanisms, there is no evidence that imperial legacies persist through risk and time preferences, or through cultural norms of savings accumulation. Instead, the results suggest that disparities in financial access are correlated with differences in savings. The spatial RD shows that farmers in Habsburg regions live significantly closer to formal financial institutions today and that increasing financial access by 1 standard deviation is associated with 0.10 standard deviation increase in total accumulated savings. Additional evidence suggests that a lack of financial access on the non-Habsburg side of the border is correlated with a propensity to invest in informal assets, such as animals, grain inventory, and jewelry. These assets have lower rates of return than formal savings accounts, such that households who use informal savings instruments have a significantly lower value of total accumulated savings: households living in non-Habsburg regions are 25 percent more likely to save in an informal asset and saving in informal assets is associated with 27 percent lower accumulated savings.====I conduct several empirical checks to verify the robustness of these findings. Falsification tests which arbitrarily move the border to the northwest and southeast rule-out placebo West-East trends in savings and financial access. In addition, I conduct an external validity analysis that replicates the spatial RD using nationally-representative data from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Life in Transition Survey II (EBRD LiTS II) within Romania, which corroborates the primary findings. This exercise suggests that the local average treatment effects observed in my sample of farmers are generalizable to a nationally representative scale. Lastly, I explore alternative channels of persistence, such as trust in financial institutions, financial literacy, and migration, and find no evidence of differences in these outcomes across the border.====The imperial differences in savings suggest important consequences for economic welfare in the region. Macroeconomic effects may be ambiguous if savings imbalances do not translate into larger differences in capital investment or wealth, which I do not observe in my data. On the microeconomic scale, however, savings is important for consumption smoothing and protection against economic shocks. Using the EBRD LiTS II data I explore households’ ability to cope with economic shocks in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis. This exercise suggests that savings is negatively associated with the probability that households lower consumption, decrease medical care, shut off utilities, sell an asset, or are forced to move during the Global Recession.====These findings contribute to a larger literature on under-savings by highlighting an unexplored determinant of savings – history.==== It is well-known that historical events are an important determinant of economic development, as they influence institutions, trust, education, infrastructure, health, and technology (Nunn, 2009). Yet, savings legacies have been under-studied. Given that savings rates have serious implications for economic welfare, it is crucial to understand their origins. Moreover, while the empirical savings literature has made significant progress in quantifying the relationship between economic preferences and savings (Ashraf, Karlan, Yin, 2006, Tanaka, Camerer, Nguyen, 2010, Bauer, Chytilova, Morduch, 2012, Giné, Goldberg, Silverman, Yang, 2018), there is little understanding of how these preferences arise, especially in middle-income countries like Romania.====In addition, this paper relates to a recent literature exploring the mechanisms through which historical events and institutions influence contemporary economic outcomes.==== In doing so, my work also contributes to a growing literature using lab in the field methods to explore questions in economic history.==== The findings highlight the importance and reinforcing nature of culture and institutions in shaping current outcomes (Alesina and Giuliano, 2015).====The paper proceeds as follows. The next section discusses the historical setting in which differential savings patterns might have emerged, while Section 3 briefly discusses the theoretical intuition for persistence in savings. Section 4 describes the empirical framework and presents the initial results on savings. Section 5 carefully explores the channels of persistence, and Section 6 conducts several robustness checks.

We examine the conflict’s impacts on associational membership using event location data and unique survey data on governance, peace and security (GPS-SHaSA).

Robust estimations constrained to non-migrants samples also rule out selection into migration. Yet this result, consistent with the argument that armed conflict cultivates social engagement, is not a positive outcome in the case of Mali. The increase is observed solely for family and political associations, which are comparatively inward-looking and act as interest groups. We interpret this finding as a form of withdrawal behind group or community boundaries, an interpretation supported by further analysis of interpersonal trust. This sort of withdrawal may exacerbate ethnic divisions and deepen the conflict.","Terrorism and armed conflicts have become a major concern in recent years as they increasingly challenge individual, local and regional development around the globe. In addition to the destruction of physical capital and human losses, these events have adverse short- and long-term repercussions on economic outcomes (Abadie, Gardeazabal, 2003, Collier, Elliot, Hegre, Hoeffler, Reynal-Querol, Sambanis, 2003, Gaibulloev, Sandler, 2009). There is still an open question about the channels through which armed conflicts impact economic development. The role of social capital warrants particular attention in this respect.==== Indeed, it can positively influence development outcomes, especially in areas with market failure, weak formal institutions and scarce public goods (Woolcock and Narayan, 2000). Social capital connects individuals, facilitates collective action and plays a substantial role in the provision of public goods in these areas (Putnam, Leonardi, Nonetti, 1993, Durlauf, Fafchamps, 2005). A number of studies have highlighted the pro-social effect of armed conflict (Bellows, Miguel, 2006, Bellows, Miguel, 2009, Voors, Nillesen, Verwimp, Bulte, Lensink, Van Soest, 2012, Gilligan, Pasquale, Samii, 2014) and some of them have explicitly suggested that the pro-social impact of war may explain the documented economic recovery of many post-war societies (Davis, Weinstein, 2002, Brakman, Garretsen, Schramm, 2004, Miguel, Roland, 2011). However, these studies usually consider social capital as unidimensional or uniform, even though it is theoretically depicted as a multifaceted notion. Studies considering different facets of social capital question this optimism (Cassar, Grosjean, Whitt, 2013, Rohner, Thoenig, Zilibotti, 2013, Grosjean, 2014). These latter results echo theoretical and empirical evidence based on ethnographic and archaeological data. Indeed, inter-group conflict should favour both altruistic behaviours towards one’s own group, and exclusionary behaviours against out-groups, also called parochialism (Choi, Bowles, 2007, Bowles, 2009). This paper contributes to this literature. It focuses on participation in associations according to their characteristics in an attempt to unravel the web of social capital and learn more about the repercussions of armed conflict on social cohesion.====Papers addressing the social legacy of conflicts generally use associational membership as a measure of social capital. However, associations are diverse and their functions and objectives highly heterogeneous. Not all associations have the same implications in terms of social interactions. Social capital can penalise non-members (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2008) and “reinforce polarisation between the ‘in’ group and the ‘out’ group” (Durlauf and Fafchamps, 2005). “Social capital can be used by certain groups to overtake others, generating between-group inequality and political tension” (====). The substantial role of association density (and networks) in the rise of the Nazi party in the 1930s (Satyanath et al., 2017) is illustrative of the potential negative effects of social capital. Knack and Keefer (1997) and Fidrmuc and Gërxhani (2008) contrast “Olsonian” and “Putnamesque” associations based on the divergent hypotheses of Olson (1982) and Putnam et al. (1993) regarding the relationship between associational activity and growth. Olsonian groups act as special interest groups at the expense of the rest of the society, whereas Putnamesque groups act more for the community at large without any negative externalities (Knack and Keefer, 1997). This Olsonian/Putnamesque distinction can be viewed in relation to the usual differentiation between strong/bonding and weak/bridging ties (Granovetter, 1973). The former are characterised by kinship-based relationships resulting from shared affinities, for instance, among relatives, neighbours or close friends, whereas the latter relate to a wider network. Bridging relationships are needed to prevent exclusion from social interactions (Jackson et al., 2012) and are considered as a “source of value-added” (Burt, 2001). If conflict spurs involvement in associations, then the kind of associations concerned matters to be able to interpret the effects on social interactions and cooperation. Some, far from bridging the gap between groups, actually widen it. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of conflict on membership of different types of associations has never been explored, at least not in a comprehensive empirical manner. Our paper contributes to the literature on the effects of social capital and questions its dominant assumption that social capital is a force of good.====The paper draws on the division between Olsonian and Putnamesque groups to develop a typology of associations to address this knowledge gap in the particularly relevant case of Mali. Mali has been at war since 2012. The conflict broke out when a number of armed groups challenged the government’s authority. The insurgents were mainly Tuareg rebel groups fighting for the independence of northern Mali and jihadist groups keen to impose Sharia law on the country. Although Mali has seen repeated Tuareg uprisings,==== jihadist groups only started thriving in the late 2000s driven by growing insecurity and central government withdrawal from the Sahelian regions (Julien, 2011).==== In January 2012, the jihadists together with the Tuaregs launched their first attacks on military positions in the north. After three months of intense fighting, the major cities of the north, including Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal, were under the insurgents’ yoke. The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which was supported by Ansar Dine (supported by Al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa), declared the north independent and imposed Islamic law.==== Meanwhile, a military coup toppled President Amadou Toumani Touré held responsible for the crisis. As jihadist groups started moving south, France launched Operation Serval under the UN flag and sent troops to stop their progress. By the end of January 2013, most cities had been taken back. Although two peace agreements were signed in 2014 and 2015 (in Ouagadougou and Algiers: Government of Mali, 2015), jihadist groups continue their attacks and political instability has spawned the emergence of new insurgent groups with ethnic and community demands. To date, the conflict has claimed thousands of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands. Although the conflict is essentially rooted in the northern and central part of Mali, it has spread throughout the country. Attacks have even taken place on the Ivoirian border on the southern edge of the country.====Civic engagement plays a key role in Mali. It is recognised as central to local governance, acting as a local intermediary and much-needed counterpart to weak public institutions. Civic engagement mainly takes the form of substantial involvement in community life, especially in local development associations (Kuepie, Sougane, 2014, Chauvet, Gubert, Mercier, Mesplé-Somps, 2015). The most recent Afrobarometer data (2017) report that two-thirds of adults in Mali attend community meetings. The Indices of Social Development (International Institute of Social Sciences, 2010) show Malian civic engagement to be particularly high compared with other African countries. Indeed, the latest available data rank Mali among the top 15 to 30 countries consistently above the continental mean for “civic activism”, “clubs and associations participation” and “interpersonal safety and trust”. In addition to this quantitative evidence, Mali’s recent history has shown civil society, and associations in particular, to be central to political transition to a democratic system (Roy, 2005). Mali has even been held up as a regional model (Chauzal, 2007) making the outbreak of violence even more unexpected to the international community. Ethnic groups moreover play a key role in the current crisis (Chauzal and van Damme, 2015). Therefore, studying what kind of association is fostered by conflict can shed new light on the current state of social interactions in Mali.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a paper has empirically studied the conflict and social capital nexus in Mali and in a former French colony of Sub-Saharan Africa.==== Our study broadens the picture and analysis to take in a different context, where the set of institutional characteristics differs substantially from other previously studied countries (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, Vishny, 1999, Djankov, Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, 2003). This case study is, unfortunately, still ongoing. The Malian conflict is in deadlock, and responses to date from national and international authorities have fallen short of the mark (Guichaoua and Pellerin, 2017). Furthermore, the Malian conflict presents a hybrid, albeit insufficiently studied form (mixing political grievances, separatism, criminal activity and terrorism), which appears to be spreading in West Africa and destabilising the region with potential unparalleled national and international demographic repercussions. This analysis can provide deeper insights into the conflict’s current repercussions and potentially offer more targeted responses.====We use two sets of data to examine the repercussions of armed conflict on social capital in Mali. First, we compute a local index of armed conflict from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Database (ACLED) project developed by Raleigh et al. (2010). ACLED lists all available newspaper articles, press agency telegrams and non-governmental organisation briefs reporting on conflict-related events since 1997. We merge this local index of armed conflict with unique nationally and regionally representative household surveys conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in 2006, 2014, 2015 and 2016. All these surveys include first-hand modules on governance and democracy issues. The 2014, 2015 and 2016 surveys at the core of our study are repeated harmonised add-on survey modules on governance, peace and security (GPS-SHaSA) and are included in the main household survey (====, hereafter EMOP). They provide perfectly comparable data on large samples of individuals.==== A highly similar 2006 module is used as a pre-conflict benchmark. We draw on these original governance datasets to analyse the repercussions of the Malian conflict on different types of social capital. The data is also rich enough to be able to address potential endogeneity issues which is another limitation of many analyses.====We find that the conflict has a causal impact on adult involvement in associations, raising participation by 7 to 14 percentage points in exposed areas. The results are driven in particular by growth in participation in inward-looking groups (Olsonian groups), namely family and political associations. These results are robust to a number of robustness checks for reverse causation, omitted variables and selection issues. We rely on two alternative strategies to address reverse causation wherever possible: instrumental variables (IV) and difference-in-differences (DiD) estimations. We interpret these findings as evidence that an increase in associational membership, far from being pro-social, actually forms a veiled withdrawal behind inner group or community frontiers and can therefore spawn exclusion and local tensions. Our interpretation is supported by additional tests showing that interpersonal trust decreases significantly in exposed areas.====The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the related literature and the conceptual framework. In Section 3, we describe our data and introduce the empirical model. In Section 4, we present our estimation results for associative engagement. Section 5 further investigates the effects of the armed conflict on the types of social capital cultivated. We summarise our findings and conclude in Section 6.",Fear Not For Man?

It checks whether foreign investors use five relevant dictators’ characteristics: age, political experience, education level, education in economics, and prior experience in business. The study is performed on a sample of 100 dictatorial countries from 1973 to 2008. We find that educated dictators are more attractive to foreign investors. We obtain strong evidence that greater educational attainment of the leader is associated with higher FDI. We also find evidence that the leader having tertiary education in economics and prior experience in business is associated with greater FDI. By contrast, the leader's age, and political experience have no relationship with FDI.","Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a driving force of global integration for a nation. One of the major obstacles to FDI is the risk of expropriation, while the protection of private ownership increases individual incentives to invest in the country. Another risk of international investment is related to the implementation of inappropriate macroeconomic policy and, more broadly, business-unfriendly public policy. These are the components of the political risk which international investors face. As a consequence, institutions associated with the protection of property rights have been widely shown to enhance FDI (Gastanaga et al., 1998; Daude and Stein, 2007; Asiedu and Lien, 2011). So have institutional devices that guarantee policy stability and limit government interference in the economy (Büthe and Milner, 2008; Jensen, 2008).====Formal institutions partly explain why democracies tend to attract more FDI than nondemocratic regimes (e.g., Jensen, 2003, 2008) but have less relevance for explaining the variations in FDI inflows in regimes in which such institutions are either non-existent or less effective (Gehlbach and Keefer, 2012; Jensen et al., 2014). In this paper, we switch the focus from political institutions to an overlooked factor, namely the personal characteristics of the dictator. In regimes in which policy choices depend foremost on the discretion of a single individual, the leader's characteristics can play a greater role in attracting FDI than institutions. Indeed, these characteristics can help potential investors anticipate dictators’ future policy choices when making their investment decisions.====We consider two sets of characteristics that could be useful for investors: first, personal characteristics that indicate the leader's competence in economic matters (namely his educational attainment, whether he studied economics, and whether he has prior working experience in the business sector); second, personal characteristics that may influence his expected tenure length and thereby his incentives to expropriate investment (namely his age and prior political experience).====The empirical purpose of this study is thus to examine the impact of dictators’ characteristics on FDI inflows. We perform fixed effects estimations to explain FDI inflows on an unbalanced panel of 100 countries from 1973 to 2008. We find that educated leaders are more attractive for foreign investors in dictatorships: greater educational attainment is associated with higher FDI inflows. We also show evidence that dictators who studied economics are more appealing to foreign investors. However, we find no relationship between dictators’ age and prior political experience and FDI inflows: we interpret this finding as evidence that incompetence deters investment to a greater extent than expropriation risk. Additionally, we do not observe the same link between leaders’ education and inward FDI in democracies, supporting the view that leaders’ education is a signal used by foreign investors only when executive power is unconstrained.====The contribution of this paper is twofold. We first advance the understanding of the determinants of FDI inflows. The literature has mainly focused on the macroeconomic conditions and institutional framework of the host country. Even studies specifically focusing on dictatorships adopt a strictly institutional perspective (Gehlbach and Keefer, 2012; Bastiaens, 2016; Wright and Zhu, 2018). We extend this literature to the traits of leaders and thereby contribute to explaining FDI inflows when institutional constraints are weak.====We also contribute to the literature in terms of the impact of leaders’ profiles on economic outcomes. Several studies (e.g., Dreher et al., 2009; Besley et al., 2011; Congleton and Zhang, 2013) have shown that leaders’ characteristics are related to their macroeconomic performance, because they influence their policy preferences, technical skills, or dedication to public interest. We identify another (indirect) mechanism at work behind these findings by showing that leaders’ profiles also impact investors’ expectations and thus influence macroeconomic performance through this channel.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature. Section 3 details the expected relationship between dictator characteristics and investor decisions. Section 4 presents the data and the methodology used to test our hypotheses. Section 5 displays the main estimations. In Section 6, we proceed with some additional tests and robustness checks.

We find that local biases are commonly present among investors. Investors have a 9.3% higher probability and put 105% more money in lending to local borrowers. We also find that overinvesting in local loans is correlated with higher default risk, lower recovery rate, and lower realized return, suggesting the underperformance of these locally biased investors. By taking advantage of the diverse local culture and institutional features in China, we further show that social heterogeneity, including geography, language, and social trust, affects the degree of local biases in the P2P lending market. We propose two debiasing techniques from the P2P platforms’ perspective.","The literature in behavioral economics has shown that financial decisions made by individual investors are driven by various behavioral biases (e.g., Agrawal, 2012; Ayal et al., 2011; Shapira and Venezia, 2008; Thaler, 1999). Among them, local bias is a widely documented behavioral bias in a variety of financial markets. The local bias in financial and investment contexts occurs when investors’ portfolios are biased toward “local” assets, such as local firms or borrowers. Local biases cause both professional and nonprofessional financial decision-making to deviate from rational benchmarks (Ofir and Wiener, 2016; Hirshleifer, 2001).====In this paper, we investigate the existence of local bias in investors’ lending decisions and its contributing factors in the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending market in China. With the recent development of technological agility and fintech innovation to allow for greater convenience, speed, and quality of service, the P2P lending platforms are experiencing tremendous growth to better serve both borrowers and lenders in China. China became the largest market in online P2P lending, with $56 billion in the total value of the transaction, more than 5000 P2P lending platforms, and more than 3 million lenders monthly in 2016. Given the large market volume, the importance of this alternative financing mechanism to the private sector====, and the fact that the majority of P2P investors are individuals who are most likely to suffer from behavior biases, there are numerous policy and social welfare implications to investigate the investors’ behavior in this market.====We begin by examining the existence of local bias in the online P2P lending market. We find that local biases are commonly present among lenders. On average, lenders have a 9.3% higher probability of lending money to local borrowers. In terms of the investment amount, investors put 105% more money into local loans after controlling for personal and loan characteristics and time fixed effects. These results are robust to a variety of tests, using different samples, clusters of errors, and regression models.====P2P lending is a financial decision, so the economic rationale should have some bearing on loan decisions. Local lenders may have private information about loans or borrowers that out-of-province lenders do not share. If this is the case, local loans should be safer and have higher realized returns. However, we show that loans attracting more local lenders perform worse. The preference of local loans is correlated with higher default risk, a lower recovery rate, and lower realized return. This suggests that local bias is more likely to be rooted in behavioral reasons in the P2P market.====Understanding the biases, the contributing factors, and their effect may help reduce them and help develop debiasing techniques (Byrne and Utkus, 2013; Larrick, 2004).==== Specifically, we highlight the role of social capital in forming the local bias. Social capital theory suggests that social capital, the network of relationships possessed by an individual or a social network and the set of resources embedded within the network, strongly influence individuals’ behavior (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Bandura, 1989). Putnam (1995) suggests that social capital facilitates coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit. Arrow (1972) argues that much of the economic backwardness in the world might stem from a lack of mutual confidence. In line with this view, the literature focuses on the importance of social capital from a macroeconomic perspective (La Porta et al., 1997; Knack and Keefer, 1997; Guiso et al., 2004; Sangnier, 2013; Lins et al., 2017; Chen and Ge, 2018).====To investigate the role of social capital in forming a local bias, we adopt one of the most commonly used conceptualizations of social capital by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998). They define social capital as the ""sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual or social unit"". They consider social capital in terms of three distinct dimensions: cognitive, relational, and structural. A widely used measure of the cognitive dimension is the shared language (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). The most important factor in the relational dimension is the social trust (Putnam, 1995; Fukuyama, 1995; Cohen and Prusik, 2001; Guiso et al., 2004). The commonly used proxy for the structural dimension is the presence or absence of social interaction ties between individuals. Since borrowers and lenders do not physically know each other in the P2P platform, we focus on the former two dimensions and do not investigate the structural dimension.====We use the proportion of hilly terrain and the number of dialects to measure the cognitive dimension of social capital (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). Geography and language continue to play a key role in local economies, despite sharp declines in transportation costs and vast increases in information technology (Angrist and Lavy, 1997; Krugman, 1991; Lang, 1986). The diverse populations have greater heterogeneity in their priors or different interpretations of the same news due to different cultures or languages emphasizing different types of information (Chang et al., 2015). Research from psychology indicates that linguistic diversity, in particular, should lead to more varied and creative interpretations of signals. We find that in hillier areas or areas with more dialects, investors are more prone to local bias and that their loans have a higher default rate.====We use trust in the same province (internal trust) and trust from other provinces (external trust) to measure the relational dimension of social capital. Social trust is likely to affect investment choice because investments are made for future promises (Sapienza and Zingales, 2012). Consistent with this view, recent studies have found that trust is an important determinant of stock market participation (e.g., Guiso et al., 2008; Giannetti and Wang, 2016; Gurun et al., 2018). Individual beliefs of this sort may play a larger role when investors are unfamiliar with the stock market or lack data to assess it. Conversely, when mistrust is deeply rooted, people may doubt any information they obtain and disregard it. Investors might also have a greater local bias when internal trust is higher than external trust since trust and similar social norms, such as reciprocity, shape the way people behave toward each other and society. We find that investors in provinces with higher trust have more local bias and higher default rates.====Finally, we propose two tentative debiasing techniques from the platforms’ perspective, following the recent developments in behavioral science. First, loans from other provinces with similar characteristics should appear at the top of the new loan listing. These loans would catch the attention of the investors and naturally lead to a diversification result. Second, instead of investing in the loan, the platform could securitize the loans with similar characteristics, but across different provinces, as a package and sell it to investors, which could result in a diversified portfolio.====Our results are robust to the city-level analysis, the transaction level analysis, and controlling for the borrower, investors, and calendar month fixed effects. We also adopt two alternative measures to confirm the results that local loans perform worse: Sharpe ratio of the investment and abnormal return at the investor-province-month level. We further conduct a back-of-envelope calculation on how much people lose due to local bias. We find that, with a strong local bias, borrowers from areas with fewer investors need to wait longer to have the borrowing fully funded and investors from areas with fewer borrowers would have a lower return.====The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, our paper is linked to the literature on social capital. A recent series of papers by Guiso et al. (2004, 2006, 2008, 2009) shows that differences in trust help explain stock market participation and other facets of portfolio investment. Eccles et al. (2014) show that high social capital firms implement processes that engage with stakeholders over the long term. Sapienza and Zingales (2012) suggest that social trust is likely to affect investment choice because investments are made for future promises. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the role of social capital in the formulation of investors’ local bias in a P2P lending market.====Second, this paper contributes to the understanding of local bias in a different type of financial market—an online P2P lending platform. There is a large amount of literature documenting local bias in financial markets. For example, Cooper and Kaplanis (1994), Dziuda and Mondria (2012), and others have found local bias in the stock market. Fidora et al. (2007) found it in the global bond market. Based on data from the Prosper platform, Lin and Viswanathan (2015) find that after the borrower moves to another state, the percentage of origination state bids decreases by 10.9%, whereas the percentage of destination state bids increases by 21.2%. The percentage of origination state bids decreases by 12.4%, whereas the percentage of destination state bids increases by 23.5%. They conclude that the data are consistent with a psychological explanation of home bias in the U.S. P2P market. In contrast, using the same data set, some researchers have cited evidence that information asymmetry leads to the local bias effect (Kim and Kim, 2017; Senney, 2018). We contribute to the literature by using a Chinese P2P lending platform in which the information channel is unlikely to work and the investors are prone to behavioral biases. We find that the lenders have a 9.3% higher probability of lending money to local borrowers. In terms of the investment amount, the lenders put 105% more money into local loans.====Third, our paper contributes to the P2P lending literature. Most of the research in this area mainly analyze default risk by using the characteristics of borrowers and products. Studies have examined the credit ratings (Herzenstein et al., 2008), gender (Barasinska and Schaefer, 2010), appearance (Duarte et al., 2012; Pope and Sydnor, 2011), and friend networks (Freedman and Jin, 2014) of borrowers to analyze default rates. In contrast, we offer an alternative view of lenders, documenting that their local bias leads to unfavorable outcomes in their lending decisions. Understanding biases and their effect may help reduce these outcomes and help develop debiasing techniques (Byrne and Utkus, 2013; Larrick, 2004).====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Difference-in-difference estimations show that all immigrant groups followed similar trends in segregation before the passage of immigration laws; afterwards, segregation among immigrants from more restricted countries declined relative to segregation among immigrants from less restricted countries. I then construct linked census samples at the individual level, and study mechanisms behind de-segregation. I find two possible mechanisms: (a) limitations on new arrivals; (b) selection on return migration. Further analyses suggest that de-segregation might not benefit immigrants’ socioeconomic assimilation.","In the early twentieth century, the U.S. passed several immigration restriction laws in the background of anti-immigration populism, putting severe limitations on immigration from Europe, Asia, and Africa. Following the earlier Emergency Quota Act of 1921, the Immigration Act of 1924 marked the end of the “open borders period” in the U.S. history (Ngai, 1999, Ngai, 2004). A quota system was established and the number of newcomers could not exceed the quota for each sending country. While quotas were assigned to all European countries, the effects of quota systems were heterogeneous. In particular, very low quotas were assigned to Southern and Eastern European countries. Using data from five U.S. decennial censuses from 1900 to 1940 (Ruggles et al., 2017), I link U.S. counties and individual immigrants across censuses, and examine effects of immigration restriction laws on immigrant segregation. Specifically, I study how immigration restriction laws led to different trends in segregation between immigrant groups that were less or not restricted and immigrant groups that were severely restricted.====Immigrant segregation can be dynamic over time: on one hand, immigrants spatially assimilate to the host society (Massey and Denton, 1985); on the other hand, many new immigrants prefer ethnic enclave residence upon arrival (Bartel, 1989). Moreover, the spatial and social behaviors of the native-born population also affect immigrant segregation. In the context of this paper, internal migration towards cities became increasingly common in the late nineteenth century U.S. (Ferrie, 2003, Hall, Ruggles, 2004), which could affect immigrant segregation because most immigrant enclaves were located in cities. In particular, the early twentieth century was the era of Great Black Migration, which was partially delayed by mass immigration (Collins, 1997), but nonetheless occurred by around 1920 (Collins and Wanamaker, 2014). African Americans affected immigrants’ social outcomes (e.g., Boyd, Xiaohe, 2003, Fox, Guglielmo, 2012), and African Americans’ migration led to racial segregation in many cities (Shertzer et al., 2016), which could further change the pattern of immigrant segregation. Finally, natives’ negative attitudes towards immigrants (hostility, discrimination) were common (e.g., Higham, 1963, Brown, Warner, 1992, Goldin, 1994, Ngai, 1999, Haines, 2000, Moser, 2012, Abramitzky, Boustan, Eriksson, 2017), and could also affect the dynamics of immigrant segregation.====Among seven major immigrant groups that had over one million people in 1920, the British, Canadian, Irish, and Scandinavian group were less or not restricted by immigration restriction laws,==== while the Italian, Polish, and Russian group were severely restricted. On the other hand, other social factors (e.g., Great Black Migration) might affect all immigrant groups. Researchers find that in general, immigrant segregation in the U.S. declined until 1920 but then started to rise (Cutler et al., 2008). I compare county-level immigrant segregation across groups, before and after the passage of immigration restriction laws. I find that all major immigrant groups experienced similar trends in segregation before the 1920s. After the 1920s, however, segregation rose among less restricted groups, while segregation among more restricted groups became relatively lower.====I then focus on immigrants who stayed in the U.S. during the 1920s, and study their segregation and residential patterns. To do so, I build individual-level panel data by linking the 1930 immigrant census sample to 1920 census data, and examine the effects of immigration laws on the share of immigrants of the same origin in the enumeration district. I find that immigration restriction laws decreased ethnic enclave residence of more restricted groups, which is consistent with county-level results of segregation trends.====There are several possible mechanisms behind the effects of immigration laws on immigrant segregation. Researchers observe that immigrants move to less segregated areas as a consequence of assimilation (e.g., Duncan, Lieberson, 1959, Gordon, 1964, Massey, Denton, 1985, Bartel, 1989). Hence, immigration laws had direct effects on segregation, as the number of new immigrants from more restricted countries significantly declined after the 1920s. I indeed find that differences in arrivals of new immigrants between more and less restricted groups could lead to differences in segregation patterns. In particular, this mechanism was associated with positive selection on immigration among more restricted groups caused by immigration restriction laws.====In addition, it is possible that immigration laws could indirectly affect immigrant segregation through spatial behaviors of old immigrants who had settled down in the U.S. I call this as the “indirect effect”, as immigration laws did not directly restrict old immigrants. However, natives’ attitudes towards immigrants, especially after the passage of immigration restriction laws, could still affect old immigrants’ spatial behaviors. I use linked individual-level census samples to explore two types of migration behaviors: internal migration and return migration among old immigrants. Consistent with earlier historical research (e.g., Cerase, 1974), I find that selection on return migration might partially explains trends in immigrant segregation: immigrants from more restricted countries were more likely to stay in the U.S. after the 1920s if they previously lived in less segregated areas, especially compared to those from less restricted countries. On the other hand, I find no significant relationship between internal migration and trends in segregation.====After reporting the main findings of trends in segregation, I discuss the subsequent effects of (de-)segregation on immigrants’ assimilation. In each group, I focus on the literacy rate and English skills for both first- and second-generation immigrants, which were widely immigration-related social issues discussed by natives at that time (Ngai, 2004). Although recent studies (e.g., Bleakley and Chin, 2010) find that de-segregation is generally correlated with linguistic assimilation, I find no strong evidence that de-segregation improved immigrants’ literacy and English skills. Furthermore, I find no clear relationship between de-segregation and labor market outcomes of both immigrants and natives.====This paper adds to the literature of population economics and economic history by using recently available and usable full-count census data to examine effects of immigration restriction laws on immigrant segregation. The degree of ethnic segregation rose in the early twentieth century U.S. (Logan and Parman, 2017). Black migration (Vigdor, 2002, Collins, Wanamaker, 2014) contributed to changing segregation patterns, but the rise in immigrant segregation also played a crucial role (Cutler et al., 2008). In recent years, many researchers examine how immigration restriction laws affected European immigrants’ return migration (e.g., Greenwood, Ward, 2015, Ward, 2017). However, less is known about the relationship between immigration restrictions and trends in segregation, and furthermore, the possible mechanisms behind such trends.====Understanding immigrant segregation also has important implications for urban policy. Following earlier works (e.g., Cutler et al., 2008), this paper shows that immigrant segregation was affected by immigration laws, and furthermore, natives’ attitudes towards immigration (e.g., Burns and Gimpel, 2013). Further analyses, however, show that only some mechanisms studied in the prior literature could explain trends in segregation in this paper. In addition, this paper adds to the literature of social impacts of (de-)segregation. While many papers point out de-segregation is associated with immigrants’ social assimilation (e.g., Massey, Denton, 1985, Cutler, Glaeser, Vigdor, 2008, Bleakley, Chin, 2010), this paper shows that de-segregation—which, in contrast to many other contexts, was not a choice variable for immigrants in the context of this paper—does not necessarily help the immigrant population and the society.====In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 introduces the historical background. Section 3 introduces data and methods. Section 4 presents the main empirical analysis. Section 5 further discusses mechanisms behind empirical findings of this paper.

This study explores one possible mechanism behind this finding: innovation. I investigate the effects of communication and energy services reform in India in the mid-1990s on downstream manufacturing firms’ decisions to invest in R&D. The empirical analysis uses manufacturing-firm level data and regulation indicators in the communications and energy service sectors. The liberalization of services in India had a positive effect on manufacturing-firm innovation. These results are concentrated on firms in the middle of the initial productivity distribution. The main channel is the elimination of entry barriers into the communication sector.","Services liberalization plays an important role in enhancing economic growth through input-output linkages (Francois and Hoekman, 2010). As manufacturing firms rely on service providers to produce final goods, the cost and quality of service inputs shape the performance of downstream manufacturing firms. Recent micro-level studies have shed new light on how services reform affects manufacturing firms’ productivity (Arnold, Mattoo, Narciso, 2008, Arnold, Javorcik, Mattoo, 2011, Arnold, Javorcik, Lipscomb, Mattoo, 2016, Fernandes, Paunov, 2012). Previous work has also shown that input-trade liberalization in India had a positive effect on firm productivity (Topalova and Khandelwal, 2011) and domestic product growth (Goldberg et al., 2010). This paper explores one possible channel through which communication and energy services liberalization may improve manufacturing firms’ productivity: innovation. R&D investments are a determinant of productivity gains and economic growth (Aghion, Griffith, Howitt, Prantl, 2009, Crepon, Duget, Mairesse, 1998, Griffith, Huergo, Mairesse, Peters, 2006).==== If services liberalization, via greater competition, improves the efficiency and cost of communication and energy services inputs, it can create incentives for manufacturing firms to increase their innovation and improve their productivity.====Little is known about the effects of services liberalization on manufacturing firms’ R&D decisions. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between the Indian reform in the communication (post and telecommunications) and energy (electricity and gas) services sectors and downstream manufacturing firms’ R&D activities. India is an interesting setting in which to consider this relationship, as it underwent substantial services reform affecting communications and energy in the mid-1990s. In the communication sector the two main policy instruments used during the reform were the privatization that resulted in the elimination of entry barriers for domestic firms and the removal of restrictions for foreign companies. These policies increased domestic and foreign competition in the communication-services sector, leading to lower prices for this service input used by manufacturing firms. The average price of a one-minute wireless call fell 75% during the liberalization period (World Bank report, 2004). The reform of the energy sector was launched in the mid-1990s and also consisted in the opening of electricity generation to private domestic and foreign suppliers. Nevertheless, the new regulations for the energy sector took much more time to implement than those in the communication sector, and were effective mainly from 2000 onwards. The average electricity price at purchasing power parity fell 16% from 2000 to 2009 (Asian Development Bank).==== Greater competition in both the communication and energy sectors has not only reduced input prices, but also created incentives for firms to invest in technology to upgrade the quality/efficiency of those inputs. I first show that services liberalization in these sectors boosted the performance of service firms in India. They increased their sales, technological investment and productivity gains. This result is mainly driven by foreign-owned firms in these service sectors.====Technological improvements in communication and energy services also helped manufacturing firms that used these inputs to improve their efficiency and reduce their costs, and so increase profits. In the context of fixed innovation costs in the downstream sector, communication and energy services reform allows some manufacturing firms that were not able to invest in R&D to increase their profits and pay the fixed costs of innovation. I present a simple theoretical framework to rationalize these input-output linkages via which communication and energy services liberalization affects manufacturing firms’ innovation choices. The model features an upstream sector producing differentiated services inputs in a Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic-competition structure, and a downstream sector with a continuum of firms with different productivity levels that use the services inputs to produce final goods. The downstream manufacturing firms can pay a fixed innovation cost to increase their efficiency by reducing their marginal costs. The model predicts that liberalization in the upstream sector through a reduction of the fixed production cost (the variety channel) or the marginal cost of services (the marginal-cost channel) will lower the price index for service inputs, increasing the expected profits of downstream firms and their probability of innovation. This effect is driven by manufacturing firms in the middle-range of the productivity distribution that were not profitable enough pre-reform to pay the fixed innovation cost. I then test the two predictions of the model using Indian firm-level data, Prowess, over the 1993–2005 period. This data is provided by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy.==== The empirical analysis captures services liberalization by an index measuring regulation in the communications and energy sectors in India constructed by the OECD and weighted by manufacturing sector’s reliance on service inputs in the pre-reform year (1993).====The identification strategy exploits the variation in the size of the upstream services reform across downstream industries, depending on the extent to which manufacturing firms relied on these service inputs. In this upstream-downstream approach, the effect of services liberalization on firms’ R&D investments is more pronounced for firms producing in downstream sectors that use service inputs more intensively.====The question that arises when looking at the relationship between the liberalization of upstream services sectors and downstream firms’ R&D investment choices is whether manufacturing firms lobbied to liberalize the service sector. I address this potential endogeneity concern in a number of different ways. First, the input weights used in the services index are constructed using the Indian input-output matrix in the pre-reform year. Second, prior to the introduction of services reform, firms producing in industries that relied more on these service inputs were no different from those producing in industries with lower service input-intensity. Third, I present evidence that changes in the services index are uncorrelated with initial industry and firm characteristics. The results suggest that the different measures of service liberalization are free from reverse-causality concerns. Fourth, all specifications include firm fixed effects and region-time trends. In the specifications considering the heterogeneous effects of services reform depending on manufacturing firms’ TFP, I also control for unobservable industry-level shocks that vary over time via the inclusion of industry-year fixed effects. Finally, I carry out two additional robustness tests, using (i) alternative input weights from the US and (ii) instrumental-variable estimation using as instruments the services-reform indices in China and Brazil, countries that experienced service-sector reforms that were uncorrelated with the potential lobbying interests of Indian firms.====We present new empirical evidence on how upstream services reform creates incentives for downstream manufacturing firms to innovate in developing countries. The estimates first suggest that communication and energy-services liberalization increased the probability of investing in R&D by 6 percent and R&D intensity by 1 percent.==== The effect of services liberalization on firms’ R&D choices is heterogeneous according to firm initial productivity: for a one standard-deviation fall in the services index, firms in the middle range of the productivity distribution have a 9.6 percent higher probability to innovate and increase their share of R&D investments by 2 percent. These results are robust to using alternative measures of initial firm performance, such as profitability and capital intensity. These findings confirm the theoretical predictions of the model. We also test empirically the source of this heterogeneous effect, exploiting differences across industries in innovation intensity as a proxy for fixed innovation costs. Our results confirm the predictions of the simple theoretical model: the heterogeneous reform effects are related to firm and industry heterogeneity. The productivity cutoff to start innovating is lower in industries with low-innovation intensity than in industries with high-innovation intensity. Our findings suggest that in industries that are more innovation-intensive (and so have a high productivity cutoff) service reform allows only middle-range productivity firms to innovate, while in industries with low innovation-intensity (and a low productivity cutoff) the least productive firms also benefit from this reform.====I then explore the effects of each services sub-indicator separately. The findings suggest that the effect of communication-services reform (post and telecommunications) is twice as large as the effect of energy reform (electricity and gas) on manufacturing firms’ innovation choices. I next disentangle the main mechanisms through which service liberalization affects downstream firms’ innovation decisions by looking at the effects of two sub-indices: entry barriers and the extent of public control. The findings suggest that both channels are important, and the main mechanism through which India’s services liberalization has affected manufacturing firms innovation decisions is the elimination of entry barriers in the communication sector.====These findings are robust and stable to specifications that control for firm, industry and State characteristics that may be correlated with services liberalization and might change over time. All specifications include region-time trends and industry concentration trends. I also control for pre-existing firm trends that take into account unobservable shocks to firms of similar sizes and capital intensity over time. I explicitly take into account the effect of other reforms that took place in India during this period. I control for industrial reform, trade liberalization, including both output and input tariffs at the industry level, financial liberalization and other structural reforms affecting Indian States over time by introducing region-time trends. The specifications that test for the non-linear effect of services liberalization allow me to include industry-year fixed effects controlling for all unobservable shocks varying across industries over time. In these specifications, I am also able to take into account the heterogeneous effect of other reforms as a function of initial firm productivity. A series of additional sensitivity tests show that the findings are robust to different specifications: instrumental variables and alternative econometric specifications and samples depending on the type of firm ownership. The economic impact of services reform found here is in line with the findings in Arnold et al. (2016) that Indian services liberalization has increased firm TFP by 11.7 percent over the same analysis period. Part of this increase in Indian firm TFP might be explained by firms’ innovation activities related to services liberalization.====This paper contributes to the recent and growing microeconometric literature on the role of upstream services reform in shaping downstream firm performance in developing countries. There are two main contributions in relation to the existing literature. First, this is the first paper to look at the effects of services reform on manufacturing firms’ R&D decisions. Second, we go one step further and explore the non-linear effects of services reform on firms’ innovation choices, depending on their initial performance. As opposed to the literature that looks at input-output linkages at the micro-level, our empirical analysis is theoretically-grounded. We show that the heterogeneous effects are driven by fixed innovation costs that differ across industries. Arnold et al. (2011) use firm-level data from the Czech Republic to show that services liberalization, through the entry of foreign providers, has positive effects on manufacturing firms’ productivity. Along the same lines, Fernandes and Paunov (2012), using firm-level data from Chile and specific measures of firm-level services use, find that FDI services liberalization improved firm productivity, with a stronger effect for manufacturing sectors with more-intensive R&D activities. The recent work of Arnold et al. (2016) on India’s services liberalization finds that banking, telecommunications, insurance and transport reforms increased the total factor productivity of manufacturing firms. Bas and Causa (2013) analzye Chinese firm-level data and a similar index to that used here, measuring regulation in energy and communications. They show that services reforms enhance downstream firms’ productivity, with a stronger effect for firms producing closer to the technological frontier. More recently, Bas (2014) underlines that India’ services liberalization has had a positive effect on manufacturing firms’ export decisions and export revenues. Her results identify one potential channel through which services reform shapes manufacturing-firm productivity: services liberalization creates incentives for firms to engage in R&D activities, and the effects of this reform are not equal across firms within an industry.====My findings also complement recent work on the effects of structural reforms in India. Much of the research here uses the same firm-level dataset: Prowess. Alfaro and Chari (2009) show that although private firms in the Indian economy grew in importance after the economic reforms in the early1990′s, State-owned firms still have a considerable share of total production and assets in some sectors. Harrison et al. (2013) focus on a number of Indian reforms and find that aggregate productivity improvements due to industrial delicensing were concentrated among larger firms. Topalova and Khandelwal (2011), Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik, Topalova, 2010, Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik, Topalova, 2009, and DeLoecker et al. (2016) look at the micro-economic effects of trade liberalization in India in the early 1990s. Input-tariffs cuts contributed significantly to lower marginal costs, firm productivity growth and the ability of firms to introduce new products.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes India’s communication and energy services liberalization and the effect of services reform on the performance of service firms. Section III discussed the main theoretical mechanisms through which services liberalization might affect firms’ R&D decisions, and Section IV then presents the firm-level data and the services index. Section V describes the estimation strategy and the results of the baseline specifications, and Section VI explores the robustness of the main results.

We use parental residence prior to a policy change in Shanghai as an instrument for primary school type, and find that migrant children who attended private primary schools are 10% less likely to enter high schools without retention than their counterparts who attended public primary schools. We show that both institutional barriers and learning at the primary school stage affect students’ probability of entering high school and whether they go to regular or vocational high schools.","The influence of school type on children’s educational outcomes has been an important research topic for decades, but the empirical findings have been rather mixed. In developed countries, many studies have examined the effectiveness of charter schools and private Catholic schools relative to regular public schools, with some documenting positive effects on test scores (Hoxby, Rockoff, 2004, Clark, 2009), while others finding virtually no effect (Hanushek, Kain, Rivkin, Branch, 2007, Imberman, 2011). Evidence from developing countries is even more disparate. For example, Newhouse and Beegle (2006) find the test scores of public secondary school students are higher than those in private schools in Indonesia. But quite a few studies also show a significant private school achievement advantage in other developing countries (Cox, Jimenez, 1990, Jimenez, Lockheed, Paqueo, 1991, Kingdon, 1996, Alderman, Orazem, Paterno, 2001, Tooley, Bao, Dixon, Merrifield, 2011). Given that the comparisons of pubic and private schools are rather heterogenous in different places at different times, it is probably not surprising to have such varied results. To obtain a deeper and fuller understanding of the issue of school type, one needs to conduct more in-depth context-specific studies in different circumstances.====In addition, much less is known regarding the long-run effects of school type, especially in the context of developing countries. We are aware of only one study for Indonesia on the wage differences between graduates from private secondary schools and public schools (Bedi and Garg, 2000). However, the long-run effect is what ultimately matters for the effectiveness of education. Any short-run impacts may be either amplified or subdued over time. Measures of short-run effects, typically test scores, may not reflect true learning and human capital accumulation. For instance, some schools may be exam-oriented and add no value to students’ human capital for their life outcomes (Li et al., 2012).====This paper contributes to this literature by studying a particular type of private school in China, schools established primarily to enroll migrant children, hence also called “migrant schools”. China’s rapid urbanization since the early 1990s has witnessed the largest rural-to-urban migration in world history, including a large population of school-age children who migrated to towns and cities with their parents. Using the 2015 population Census data, Lv et al. (2018) estimate the number of migrant children to be almost 35 million. Under the Chinese ==== system, migrant children have limited access to public education resources in the destination cities. Public funding for nine-year compulsory education, which includes the primary and middle school stages, is provided through local governments at the county or district level. Despite directives from the central government, in many cases, local governments are unwilling or unable to fund migrant children’s education, as migrant children have no local ====. As a result, many migrant children have to enter migrant schools.====We focus on one particularly important long-run outcome for migrant children: whether they attend high schools without retention. Children failing to attend high schools without retention either drop out or are retained in middle schools, both of which have negative effects. Dropout leads to a detrimental effect on human capital accumulation, which relates to individuals’ future earnings and health, as shown by Card (1999) and Lleras-Muney (2005).==== Dropout before completing high schools also increases the likelihood of criminal participation and the probability of incarceration (Lochner and Moretti, 2004). Retained children may be affected by stigmatization, having difficulty in integrating into a new study environment and forming bonds with teachers and peers. Therefore, they are more likely to drop out than children who are continuously promoted (Jimerson, Anderson, Whipple, 2002, Stearns, Moller, Blau, Potochnick, 2007). In addition, grade retention is costly in terms of additional spending and foregone earnings.====Although many studies for China have examined short-run effects of migrant schools, such as test scores and other social-psychological outcomes (Lu, Zhou, 2013, Chen, Feng, 2013, Lai, Liu, Luo, Zhang, Ma, Bai, Sharbono, Rozelle, 2014, Liu, Holmes, Albright, 2015, Wang, Tong, Cheng, 2016), our study is the first and only one that examines an important long-run effect. We do so by using self-collected longitudinal data in Shanghai that follows a cohort of fourth-grade students in 2010 up to 2017 when they were supposed to be in high school. We find that migrant children from migrant primary schools have a 10% lower probability of entering high schools without retention than those from public schools. To control for the endogeneity in school type choice, we use an exogenous policy change in Shanghai that substantially altered the probability of public school entrance in different districts as an instrument for primary school type, following Chen and Feng (2013). This effect is robust to adjustments for sample attrition and different model specifications as well as various sample restrictions.====In order to understand the mechanisms through which primary school type affects high school opportunities, we distinguish between academic (regular) high schools and vocational high schools. We find that students who attended migrant primary schools have a higher probability of dropout/retention because they have worse standardized test scores in primary school, implying that the channel of human capital accumulation has played a role. Meanwhile, students from migrant schools have a lower probability of attending vocational high schools because they are more likely to return to their hometown during the middle school years. Migrant children who stayed in Shanghai are restricted from attending regular high schools due to their ==== status, and so they are more likely to choose to attend vocational high schools. This signifies the role played by the institutional barriers faced by migrant schools, which have been widely documented by previous studies.====Our study has important policy implications. In order to promote equal opportunities and improve the educational performance of migrant children, we suggest the government do two things. First, learning at the primary school stage must be improved. This could be achieved by either investing in migrant schools or by providing migrant children more access to public schools, or both. Second, the government needs to even the playing field for migrant schools and public schools, and gradually abolish the restrictions on attending higher levels of schools in the destination cities. We believe these lessons are generally applicable to other countries also, especially in developing countries.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides background information on the education of migrant children in China. Section 3 describes the data and introduces our main empirical strategy, including the choice of instrumental variables (IVs). Section 4 reports the empirical results.

In migrating from origin to destination country, migrants observe a change in the price of the bundle of consumable goods. In particular, the migration decision can imply a reduction in the price of imported goods for the consumption bundle of migrants: emigration towards less (tariff) protected countries allows the consumption of products that were prohibitively protected in the origin countries of migrants. To test this channel we estimate the import demand effect of migrant groups coming from ==== high (tariff) protected countries. Our empirical results strongly confirm this channel and suggest a new perspective about how migration can affect welfare and trade in destination countries.","From a theoretical perspective, the factor content model of trade predicts substitutability between trade and migration: bilateral trade, by weakening wage inequalities across countries, is expected to reduce the incentive for bilateral migration. However, there is large empirical literature suggesting a positive nexus between migration and bilateral trade (Herander, Saavedra, 2005, Felbermayr, Toubal, 2012, Felbermayr, Jung, 2009, Parsons, Vézina, 2018). Two main arguments have been used in the literature to explain such a positive link. First, international migrants (especially if high-skilled) provide additional information on their origin country and reduce the bilateral cost of trade. This stimulates the exports of the host country towards the origin country of immigrants. In this regard, migrants help domestic firms in overcoming cultural barriers to trade (language, local taste of consumers, etc.) and create international business relationships (Combes, Lafourcade, Mayer, 2005, Herander, Saavedra, 2005, Rauch, Trindade, 2002). Second, immigrants have preferences for the consumption of goods/varieties produced in their own country of origin (home bias in consumption basket). The home bias in consumption choice increases the import demand for goods and varieties coming from the origin country of immigrants (Gould, 1994).====This paper proposes a new channel through which immigrants can affect the import demand of the host countries. In migrating from origin to destination country, migrants observe a change in both the number of available varieties and the price of the bundle of consumable goods: imported varieties that were prohibitively protected in their origin country become available for consumption in the host country because produced locally at cheaper prices or simply imported by the host country at a lower cost (i.e. tariff). For this reason, migrants coming from highly protected countries might boost bilateral imports from third countries.==== To fix the ideas, imagine the case of cars. German cars are (much) more expensive in Brazil than in the US;==== this is essentially due to different tariff regimes, i.e. 35% ==== tariff imposed by Brazil on German cars and 2.5% tariff imposed by the United States on the same product. Therefore, when Brazilian migrants arrive in the US, they will face a considerable reduction in the price of such a variety (German car), and what was considered prohibitive in their origin country becomes immediately affordable in consumption at destination. This constitutes an incentive for migrants to consume imported goods from third countries (German cars in US in our example). Similarly, imagine the case of “vermouth and other wine of fresh grapes flavoured with plants or aromatic substances” (HS code 2205). These products are prohibitively protected in China with an average MFN applied tariff equal to 65%; and imported free of tariff in the European Union. Therefore, in migrating from China to EU, Chinese migrants observe a sudden reduction in the price of vermouth (prohibitively protected at their origin). We therefore expect Chinese migrants demanding imported vermouth when they arrive in EU. We refer to this channel as the third-country “spillover” effect of migration on trade. Notice that this is different from the traditional trade-migration nexus which establishes a migration effect on the demand for imports specifically from the country of origin of immigrants.====To test this new channel, we estimate the bilateral import demand effect of migrant groups coming from ==== high (tariff) protected countries, by using migration flows data for 19 OECD destination countries over the period 2000–08.==== Two main results qualify our paper. First, we find a strong positive effect of migrants on the bilateral import flows between host and origin country of immigrants (confirming the validity of the traditional trade-migration nexus) - by instrumenting the flow of migrants we can also conclude on the causal relationship between immigration and trade flows. More importantly, we find overwhelming evidence of the third-country (spillover) effect of migration: immigrants coming from high (tariff) protected countries increase the import demand of the host country for varieties produced in third countries. This result is supported by several robustness checks. Moreover, three placebo tests clarify the mechanism underlying the third-country spillover effect.====The identification of the spillover effect has interesting consequences for the welfare of migrants in the destination country. By relying on a standard gravity model with CES utility function and elasticity of substitution larger than one (see Section 2), welfare gain occurs when the price of goods decreases, substitution among goods is allowed, and the variety of goods available for consumption increases. In our framework, when a migrant arrives in a less tariff protected country, all these three conditions hold and the migrant experiences consistent welfare gain.====To the best of our knowledge, the spillover effect of migration on import demand has not been identified or documented elsewhere in the migration literature. In order to identify spillover trade effects of migration we allow for the existence of a reference group, which consists of a set of countries whose import tariffs are higher than that applied by the migrant’s destination country. The characteristics of the reference group (namely average migration flows) are then allowed to affect the preferences for imports in the migrant’s destination country from a given exporting country. The idea here is that, for example, US imports from Germany may be affected not only by preferences of German migrants in the US (traditional migration-trade nexus), but also by the presence of migrants originating from other countries whose import tariffs on German products are prohibitive.====Two main econometric challenges characterize our empirical strategy. First, linear panel data estimator (OLS) will deliver biased results because of the heteroskedasticity in the error term after log transformation - see Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006). Second, the settlement of migrants across destinations may not be random, and driven (among other factors) by the availability of specific imported products at destination (home bias in consumption).==== This implies a potential endogeneity problem in the traditional trade-migration nexus. For these reasons, our baseline estimations rely on a non-linear model estimated by PPML and on a log-linear model estimated by 2SLS.====Although we do not have trade-flow observations equal to zero (as we focus on intensive margin only), we do have migration observations equal to zero. So, as a robustness check we impute the missing observations of log of migration (which corresponds to observations of migration equal to zero in level) by using recent imputation methods developed by Wei et al (2012) and Abrevaya and Donald (2017). The goal of this whole set of estimating methods is to provide a robust range of third-country-effect estimates.====Our main result suggests that a ten percent increase in the flow of bilateral migrants increases bilateral imports by 1.9% (this is the traditional migration-trade nexus). On top of this, a ten percent increase in the flow of migrants coming from third high (tariff) protected countries increases bilateral imports by up to 0.52% (spillover effect). The presence of this additional channel is supported by several robustness checks including the IV model, several sample stratifications and estimation methods. The estimates of the third-country effect are quite stable across these different approaches. Finally, three falsification tests aim at supporting the presence of the spillover effect on import demand. In particular, one of these falsification tests shows the ==== of the spillover effect for immigrants coming from ==== protected countries (in this case migrants do not experience a reduction in the price of varieties).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we sketch the theoretical framework underlying estimations. Then, in Section 3 we describe our dataset and econometric strategy. In Section 4 we present our results and the last section concludes the paper.","Migration, trade and spillover effects",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759671830502X,8 November 2019,2019,Research Article,192.0

This paper aims to bring evidence that contributes to addressing those points. Specifically, we investigate the role of oil in aid allocation of the G7 donors. Results show that, unsurprisingly, aid allocated by these donors increases significantly with oil endowment of recipient countries. Looking more deeply, we interestingly show that their strategic interests in terms of oil security play a role in their provision of aid. More importantly, we provide evidence on the existence of competition for access to oil supplies among this group of donors.","Over the last two decades, global oil consumption has increased significantly and this trend has gone hand in hand with the rise of emerging countries. Since oil is a depletable resource and it is unevenly distributed across the globe, developing secure means of accessing it is of prime importance for all countries dependent on oil imports. Therefore, we may expect oil to matter a great deal to foreign policymaking in these countries.====As foreign aid is one of the major segments of rich oil-dependent countries’ foreign policies and diplomacy, we may, in turn, expect foreign aid to serve as an instrument of those countries’ energy security policies. Indeed, in security studies, a burgeoning literature has provided anecdotal evidence of energy security influencing domestic and foreign policy (Delucchi and Murphy, 2008; Downs, 2004; Duffield, 2005; Gholz and Press, 2010; Klare, 2008; Leverett and Bader, 2005; Moran and Russell, 2009). On the other hand, several studies have also highlighted that oil-rich developing countries now account for a noticeable share of foreign aid (Lee, 2012; Arezki and Banerjee, 2014).====In light of this apparent link between foreign aid policymaking and countries’ growing oil needs, the development of foreign aid policies from several emerging countries toward oil-producing countries in Africa has attracted attention in recent years. To give some examples, as an emerging global power and the world's second-largest economy, China has engaged in numerous efforts to sustain its energy supplies and enhance its energy security. Both the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which aims at promoting investment in African oil-producing countries (Klare and Volman 2006; Taylor 2006), and the recent One Belt One Road initiative have shown Beijing's insatiable thirst for oil. On the other hand, Fuchs and Vadlamannati (2013) demonstrated that India's aid allocation is also in line with the behavior of a “needy” donor. Certainly, as explained by Woods (2008), the quest for energy security is common to most of the non-traditional donors. Furthermore, the notion of “rogue aid” has been widely employed by authors like Naìm (2007) to express concerns about the selfishness underlying the allocation of aid of these new donors.====While this literature seems to be expanding rapidly, the importance of oil in the allocation of foreign aid from rich western oil-dependent countries has rarely been explicitly tested. This paper aims to provide a systematic analysis of how G7 countries’ energy security concerns affect their foreign aid policy preferences. If some recent papers have introduced the discussion about the strategic role of oil in aid allocation (Dreher and Fuchs, 2011; Lee, 2012; Arezki and Banerjee, 2014), the literature lacks robust empirical evidence validating the aid-oil nexus and explicitly addressing the strategic resource motive of traditional western donors.====More specifically, to fill this gap in the aid literature, we assess empirically the importance of oil endowment of recipient countries in the foreign aid allocated by the major OECD donors (G7 donors). In addition, we consider the role played by the national interests of these donors in using foreign aid as a means to ensure their energy security. Finally, we investigate whether this energy security motive leads to competition for oil markets among the G7 donors, by analyzing their strategic interactions through the estimation of empirical spatial-lag models. By addressing all these issues, the major contribution of this paper is that we explicitly investigate, for the first time in the aid literature, the strategic role of oil on both aid allocation and competition between the G7 donors.====Our results confirm that the oil endowment of recipient countries impacts positively the aid allocation pattern of the G7 donors. They also reveal that for donors that are highly oil-dependent, energy security plays an important role in their aid allocation. Furthermore, we find that motivated by energy security concerns, G7 donors compete for oil resources. Indeed, the evidence suggests that recipient countries that increase their share in a major OECD donor's oil imports are likely to benefit from increased aid from all other major OECD oil-importing donors. Finally, we find cross-country differences in the impact of oil competition on aid decisions: the more oil-dependent a donor is, the higher is the impact of oil competition on its aid decision. In particular, for large European donors that are also more vulnerable to oil supply shocks, oil competition plays a higher role in aid allocation than for other G7 donors.====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide some descriptive evidence and theoretical background on the aid and oil nexus from which we derive the main assumptions underlying our analysis. In Section 3, we describe our empirical framework and the data. Section 4 presents our preliminary results and highlights the importance of energy security concerns in foreign aid. Section 5 provides additional evidence on the importance of oil competition in aid allocation for all G7 donors through a spatial-lag model. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",The role of oil in the allocation of foreign aid: The case of the G7 donors,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718301872,31 October 2019,2019,Research Article,193.0

The power of unrest as a catalyst for change can manifest itself explicitly in regime changes, such as during the “Arab Spring” of 2010–2011, or it can operate through expectations. For example, the extension of the franchise in Western societies can be seen as a bid to reduce the threat of revolution (Acemoglu, Robinson, 2000, Aidt, Franck, 2015).==== What leads to social unrest is less clear. Economic shocks are one possible contributing factor. Adverse weather and commodity price shocks, for example, have been associated with civil conflicts (Miguel, Satyanath, Sergenti, 2004, Chassang, Padro-i Miquel, 2009). The link is not limited to developing countries. The demise of the Weimar Republic at the height of the Great Depression is a prominent example of economic hardship translating into political instability and social unrest (Bracher, 1978).====In this paper, we examine from an historical perspective one of the possible determinants of unrest and protests: fiscal policy. How do budget measures affect the level of social instability? The extent to which societies fracture and become unstable in response to drastic retrenchment in the government budget is a major concern for policymakers tackling large budget deficits. From Argentina in 2001, to Greece and the London Riots in 2011, austerity measures have often coincided with waves of protest and civil unrest. Economic conditions can deteriorate further and faster if political and social chaos follows attempts to rein in spending.==== Consequently, sustainable debt levels for countries that are prone to unrest may be lower than they otherwise would be.====Our empirical analysis relies on historical data on government revenues and expenditure for 24 European countries over the period 1919 to 2008. Europe over the last century is an ideal testing ground to study the effect of fiscal consolidation on social unrest. The continent went from high levels of instability in the first half of the 20th century to relatively low ones in the second, and from frequently troubled economic conditions to prosperity. It thus provides a rich laboratory of changing economic, social and political conditions. In terms of outcome variables, we focus on riots, demonstrations, general strikes, political assassinations, and attempted revolutions. These span the full range of forms of unrest, from relatively minor disturbances to armed attempts to overthrow the established political order.====We start by documenting a set of correlations in the data between fiscal adjustments and the level of social unrest. As a first pass at the data, Fig. 1 shows the relationship between fiscal adjustment episodes and the number of incidents indicating instability. Our measure of instability is the sum of demonstrations, riots, strikes, political assassinations, and attempted revolutions in a single year in each country. The first set of five bars show the frequencies conditional on the size of budget cuts. When expenditure is increasing, the average country-year unit of observation in our data registers less than 1.4 events. For moderate budget cuts, there is no increase in the frequency of unrest. However, as austerity intensifies, the average frequency of disturbances in our sample rises. For expenditure cuts above 3% of GDP, the average frequency of events rises to 2.7 per country-year. Once austerity measures involve expenditure reductions of 5% of GDP or more, we observe around 4 events per year and country - more than twice as many as in times of expenditure increases or mild cuts. The same relationship can be observed in each of the four main subcategories of instability. The frequency of demonstrations, political assassinations, and general strikes increases with the size of the reduction in government expenditure as a share of GDP. Increases in government revenues, often obtained through an increase in taxes, have instead only small and insignificant effects. We show that these results are robust to a large set of observable country characteristics such as economic growth and unemployment, as well as possible tools available to governments to finance public deficit such as inflation. This suggests that we capture more than a general association between economic downturns and unrest.====Documenting the correlation between austerity measures and unrest and showing that this correlation is driven by expenditure cuts and not by tax increases is our first important finding. In this setting, the main identification challenge we face is to isolate changes in social unrest that are driven by austerity measures and not by other changes in government policies or overall economic conditions. Other factors, such as economic downturns, could drive up unrest and the need for cut-backs simultaneously.====In order to isolate the effect of policy decisions on social unrest, we propose an identification strategy that exploits past policy decision in neighboring countries. Our strategy builds on Buera et al. (2011), which propose a model where other countries’ past policy decisions affect policy choices through their impact on policymakers’ beliefs. In their model, past policy decisions in countries that are geographically closer receive a higher weight in influencing policymakers’ beliefs. Buera et al. (2011) use this model to study empirically the diffusion of market-oriented policies across countries in the post-war period. We apply their strategy to another set of policymakers’ beliefs: those regarding austerity measures.====First, we show that policy decisions in a given country are strongly predicted by past fiscal adjustment decisions in neighboring countries. This allows us to generate variation in fiscal variables that is plausibly driven by policymakers’ discretionary decisions rather than by the current economic conditions in a given country. The results obtained with this identification strategy are consistent with the basic correlations described above. In particular, we find that countries whose policymakers implement larger cuts in government expenditure – as explained by their neighbors’ past policies – experience larger increases in social unrest.====In the last part of the paper we study to what extent the effect of austerity on unrest has changed over the 20th century, and whether it varies depending on a country’s level of adoption of democratic institutions or penetration of peer-to-peer communication. We find that the link between austerity and unrest is present both in the interwar period and in the post World War II years with similar magnitude. We also find that this link is weak in more autocratic regimes and only appears in democratic countries. Finally, we examine if the diffusion of peer-to-peer communication technologies changes the probability of unrest. We find that our effects are stronger in countries with higher diffusion of phones per capita – which facilitates peer-to-peer communication.====Our results are informative for both the literature on the determinants of social unrest and the political economy literature on expenditure cuts.====There is a large theoretical and empirical literature on the causes and consequences of social unrest. Early theoretical contributions include Kuran (1989), Tullock (1971), and Grossman (1991). In more recent work, Passarelli and Tabellini (2017) model social unrest as a form of political participation that can shape public policies – for example when protests triggered by policy proposals feed back into policymakers’ decisions. Battaglini (2017) explores the limits of social protests as a mechanism to aggregate individual information and influence policy making.==== A vast empirical literature has shown that social unrest is positively associated with ethnic heterogeneity (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1998), income inequality (Alesina and Perotti, 1996), and negatively associated with good economic conditions (Bohlken and Sergenti, 2010; Burke and Leigh, 2010; Aidt and Leon, 2016). More recently, the literature has focused on the role of new communication technologies and social media in the amplification and diffusion of social protests (Enikolopov et al., 2016; Enikolopov et al., 2017; Manacorda and Tesei, 2016).====Earlier papers on austerity as a potential catalyst for protests have focused on case studies or a subset of the developing world. For example, Paldam (1993) finds that the run-up to new austerity measures in South American countries in the 1980s is associated with higher levels of unrest, but that actual implementation is followed by fewer disturbances. Similarly, Haggard et al. (1995) find that IMF interventions and monetary contractions in developing countries led to greater instability.==== Relative to these papers, our work offers a first systematic analysis of how budget cuts affect the level of social instability and unrest in a broad cross-section of developed countries, over a long period of time.====Our paper is also related to the political economy literature on fiscal consolidation and its economic effects. For example, Alesina et al. (1998) and Alesina et al. (2010) show that governments typically do not lose votes in elections after they implement austerity programs. Relatedly, higher deficits (more spending) does not seem to lead to reelection of incumbent parties (Brender and Drazen, 2008). Our finding that austerity can lead to social unrest - even without penalties at the ballot box - may help to explain why governments are typically reluctant to cut spending, even if this might be economically beneficial.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in the empirical analysis, Section 3 presents the main correlations in the data, and Section 4 describes our identification strategy and the main empirical results.

We exploit unique data from a unified labour force household survey which covers natives and migrants in the seven economic capital cities of that region. We first estimate the counterfactual wage distributions of UEMOA migrants in absence of migration to evaluate the compositional effect of migration (i.e., when wages are treated as exogenous). We find that regional migration increases average wages by 1.8% and generates a decrease in inequality that ranges between −1.5% (for the Gini index) and −4.5% (for the interquartile ratio). This is essentially driven by a reduction in inequality between capital cities, while the effect of migration on within-capital cities inequality is heterogeneous across countries and remains small overall. Second, when accounting for possible ==== effects of migration on stayers’ wages (i.e., when wages are treated as endogenous), we find similar to stronger effects on inequality, albeit with a smaller increase in the average wage.","Population mobility is a powerful force with important economic consequences for the individual migrant as well as for host and home societies, including in relation to inequality. While individual migrants are likely to experience a wage increase as a result of migration, it is theoretically unclear whether average wages and wage inequality at home and destination will go up or down. In particular, the impact of migration on wage inequality depends on different key factors: the characteristics of those who choose to migrate (i.e., the selection effect); the returns to these characteristics at origin versus destination (which is akin to a treatment effect); and on whether migration changes the returns to these characteristics at home and destination (i.e., general equilibrium effects).====The aim of our paper is to investigate the effect of regional migration to the main economic centers of a region on inequality across and within the countries of that region while at the same time disentangling the compositional effect of migration (i.e., when wages are exogenous) from its general equilibrium effects (i.e., when wages are endogenous).==== The difficulty in empirically assessing how migration affects wages and wage inequality is that one cannot observe counterfactual wage distributions and inequality levels in the absence of migration. Moreover, most available data sets only cover either the host or the source economy, but rarely both. This makes it difficult to study the effects of migration on the source and host country concurrently.====We exploit a unique data set covering several countries to study the effect of (cross-border) regional migration to economic capitals on the average wage and wage inequality in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).==== UEMOA countries have a long history of population mobility. Due to their common colonial history, all seven founding members share the same official language (French), a common currency and similar institutions. Furthermore, at the political level, the free movement of people in the region has been institutionalised since 1979. The colonial heritage, as well as other socio-economic factors such as land degradation, drought, limited economic opportunities, political and ethnic tensions have encouraged regional mobility.====Our empirical analysis relies on household survey data from the first phase of the 1-2-3-Survey (Brilleau et al., 2004) conducted in 2001 and 2002 in the economic capitals of the founding member states of UEMOA (capitals in parentheses). More specifically, these include Benin (Cotonou), Burkina Faso (Ouagadougou), Côte d’Ivoire (Abidjan), Mali (Bamako), Niger (Niamey), Senegal (Dakar) and Togo (Lomé). In our data, we observe migrants from UEMOA countries living in one of the seven cities, but also the natives in the destination city, as well as the natives in the capital of the country of origin. The data set has more than 50,000 observations of working age individuals, of which around 4.3% have migrated within the UEMOA.====Given that Côte d’Ivoire hosts by far the largest UEMOA migration population in Francophone West Africa, we focus in our main analysis on UEMOA migrants who live in Abidjan, the economic capital of Côte d’Ivoire and the largest city in Francophone West Africa, with nearly five million inhabitants. We therefore capture a partial but quantitatively important share of all cross-border regional migration in the UEMOA. We chose as our baseline counterfactual a scenario where all UEMOA migrants to Abidjan would have migrated to the main city of their home country instead of migrating to Abidjan, while keeping internal (domestic) migration to Abidjan constant. All UEMOA migrants are first removed from the resident population of Abidjan and are then counted as residents of the economic capital city of their respective country. We are interested in the change in average wages, and in the wage inequality level in each capital city and in the whole region. To estimate the counterfactual wage distribution of UEMOA migrants in Abidjan, we first assume a framework of exogenous wages, that is, we fix skill prices in all capital cities. Therefore, our counterfactual exercise changes only the composition of the residents in each capital. We apply the methodology developed by Chiquiar and Hanson (2005), which is an extension of DiNardo et al. (1996). In this setting, the counterfactual wage distribution of migrants is a weighted average of the observed conditional wage distributions of natives in the origin country.====Our main finding is that regional migration to Abidjan increases the average wage in the UEMOA by 1.8% and entails a decrease in overall wage inequality comprised between −1.5% (for the Gini index) and −4.5% (for the interquartile ratio). This is a moderate, yet non-negligeable effect, given that around 5% of the UEMOA working age population migrate within the UEMOA. Our results also show that the effect of regional migration is heterogeneous across countries’ economic capitals. Côte d’Ivoire, the main destination of migrants in the UEMOA, sees its average wage and inequality drop as a result of regional migration, which alters the composition of the Ivorian working population. In the main source countries, in contrast, regional migration leads to a higher average wage and to mixed effects on inequality (with either not significant or small positive effects for within-country wage inequality, depending on the country considered). Decomposing the effect of regional migration on inequality in the UEMOA into its between-country and within-country components, we show that regional migration generates a reduction of inequality between countries (by −30%), but leaves within-country inequality by and large unaffected.====To gauge the robustness of our analysis, we first implement a selection model framework to test for selection on unobservables. We do not find evidence of selection on unobservables once we control for selection on observables. Second, we extend our analysis to account for general equilibrium effects of migration on wages in the economic capitals of host and source countries. To do so, we assume two skill groups (low- and high-skill) which are affected differently by migration. Using different values for the wage elasticity with respect to migration reported in the literature, we show that general equilibrium effects on wages tend to exacerbate our previous result that regional migration decreases wage inequality in the UEMOA through lowering between-country differences. The effect of regional migration on the average wage is positive, but smaller and no longer statistically significant compared to the framework with exogenous wages. These findings are driven by the following two facts. First, UEMOA migrants tend to be selected from the lower-intermediate part of the wage distribution (both at origin and destination). Secondly, regional migration in the UEMOA generally flows from low-wage countries to countries with higher wages. When accounting for general equilibrium effects, regional migration therefore results in a depression of the average wage of natives in the destination country and in a slight increase in the average wage among natives in the sending country. With the former effect dominating, this generates a larger decrease in between-country inequality than in a setting with exogenous wages.====Our paper ties into a rich methodological and empirical literature, which analyses the effect of migration on income and income inequality in source and host countries. There is a vast empirical literature studying the effects of immigration on labour market outcomes of natives in host countries; most of it focuses on estimating wage elasticities of natives to immigration in the US and other OECD countries as host countries (for a recent review of the literature see Dustmann et al., 2016). The effect of migration on income inequality is oftentimes analysed in terms of how educated and less educated natives are differently affected by immigration.====Empirical evidence on the effect of emigration on incomes/wages in source countries, and in particular, on developing countries, is far less abundant. Barham and Boucher (1998) study how migration and remittances affect income inequality in Bluefields (Nicaragua) and find that emigration (coupled with remittances) increase income inequality in the origin. McKenzie and Rapoport (2007) investigate theoretically and empirically, in the case of Mexico, how the gradual formation of migration networks generates an inverted-U shaped relationship between migration and inequality in home communities. They find that migration has an inequality-reducing effect across communities with relatively high past migration levels. Mishra (2007) estimates that emigration from Mexico has a strong, positive effect of wages in Mexico: A 10% decrease in the number of Mexican workers due to emigration in a skill group, increases the average wage in that skill group by about 4 percent. Moreover, she suggests that emigration could be a possible explanation for the increasing wage inequality in Mexico.====Using the rich information on labour market outcomes of migrants and natives within all economic capital cities of the UEMOA allows us to study the effect of regional migration in an economic and monetary union in a Sub-Saharan context and to concurrently quantify its effects on source and host countries.==== In contrast to these earlier findings for the Latin American context, our estimates uncover more nuanced effects and show that wage inequality in source countries can either decrease or increase as a result of emigration. As for the host country, our results also highlight a difference with respect to the evidence reported for the US: wage inequality in the capital of Côte d’Ivoire, the main destination of UEMOA migrants, decreases as a result of immigration, which is mostly intermediately selected.====This paper is also related to another vein of research which investigates the effects of labour mobility on regional income convergence from a macroeconomic perspective. An interesting paper by Phan and Coxhead (2010) on Vietnam finds mixed (positive and negative) effects of regional migration on income ratios between pairs of provinces. A robust inequality-reducing impact of migration is only found for migration flows into trade-oriented provinces. Yang (2004) offers empirical evidence that regional migration in Thailand helps to reduce cross-province inequality in household incomes. Our empirical results provide further support to these previous findings on the inequality-reducing effect of regional migration between regions in a development context. The unique data set structure allows us to go beyond measuring inequality between regions/countries and to decompose overall inequality in the UEMOA into its ’between-’ and ’within-country’ components. Our results highlight the importance of within-country inequality for overall wage inequality in the West African Economic and Monetary Union.====Section 2 presents migration and inequality figures in the context of UEMOA countries. Section 3 describes the data and provides descriptive sample statistics. Section 4 reviews the assumptions and econometric methodologies to estimate a counterfactual distribution of wages for migrants. Section 5 then presents the empirical results on the change in average wages and wage inequality levels from the counterfactual to the observed scenario, along with a robustness analysis. Section 6 extends the previous analysis to account for potential general equilibrium effects.

We explore the arguably exogenous changes in the duration of secondary education as the ==== to identify the causal effect of years of schooling in urban China. The schooling years in most middle schools were reduced from three years to two years during the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese government gradually restored the middle school education years from two years to three years after 1978. An important feature of these policy changes is their large geographic variations. From local gazetteers, we find out the exact years when education years were reduced from three to two and when they were restored from two to three. Using the exogenous variation in schooling reform, we estimate that the returns to education are 12.7% for both monthly wage and disposable income.","Education is an important variable that determines economic outputs and explains economic growth in various countries (Griliches, 1970, Becker, 1994). Returns to education determine the allocation of human capital and therefore become one of the most widely estimated parameters in economics since Mincer’s seminal work (Mincer, 1974). Estimating a correct return to education is of crucial importance in designing education policies.====Getting the correct number is difficult, however. That education is an endogenous variable is widely acknowledged. Since the late 1990s, economists have proposed various instrumental variables to address the concerns of endogeneity (see Card, 1999 for an excellent review). One important approach is to exploit changes in the education system (Harmon, Walker, 1995, Duflo, 2001, Oreopoulos, 2006, Devereux, Hart, 2010, Devereux, Fan, 2011). The goal of this paper is to estimate the returns to education in urban China. We exploit the secular and geographical variations in the duration of middle school==== education that results in part of the population receiving a two-year middle school education while the other part receives a three-year education.====The Chinese labor market is an important one to study. China is currently the most populous country and the second-largest economy in the world. However, not much is known about the causal returns to education in China, although a large body of literature addresses the correlation between education and income. Previous research has shown that the returns to education in China are lower compared to those in western countries in the 1980s (Byron, Manaloto, 1990, Xie, Hannum, 1996, Johnson, Chow, 1997, Zhao, 1997, Fleisher, Sabirianova, Wang, 2005). The estimates range from 3.1% to 4.3%. These numbers fall far below global average (11%) during that period (Psacharopoulos, 1985). With the progress of market-oriented reforms, the returns have been rising rapidly during the 1990s to reach approximately the same level as those in developed countries in the early 2000s (Heckman, 2003, Zhang, Zhao, Park, Song, 2005, Wang, Fleisher, Li, Li, 2007). Zhang et al. (2005) estimate 14 consecutive years (1988–2001) of returns to education using the Urban Household Survey. They find a dramatic increase in the returns to education, from only 4% in 1988 to 10.2% in 2001.====However, what the above studies have estimated is the correlation between years of schooling and earnings, not the causality. In this paper, we propose a schooling reform as an exogenous shock to estimate the returns to education in urban China. With the progress of the Cultural Revolution since 1966, the schooling years in most middle schools (both junior high and senior high schools) were reduced from three years to two years. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese government gradually restored the years of schooling to three years. More importantly, the timelines varied across counties. We use the back-and-forth changes between two- and three-year middle school educational systems from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to document this reform. We looked through the local gazetteers to find the exact years of policy changes for 162 counties in the China Family Panel Study (CFPS). The instrumental variable estimation suggests that the returns to education are 12.7% for both monthly wage and disposable income.====Some recent studies also attempted to estimate the returns to education in China using other exogenous shocks, such as the Cultural Revolution and the Compulsory Education Law. Giles et al. (2015) use the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, which disrupted the education system in urban areas, as an arguably exogenous variation to estimate the returns to education. They estimate a return to college education of 37.1%. One concern is whether exposure to the Cultural Revolution is a good instrument for educational attainment. The exclusion restriction, based on the premise that the Cultural Revolution does not affect personal earnings through channels other than education, is unlikely to hold. The impacts of the Cultural Revolution are not restricted to the education system. For example, previous research finds evidence that exposure to the Cultural Revolution has a had direct impact on income (Yang and Li, 2011) and health (Abeysinghe, Gu, 2010, Islam, Raschky, Smyth, 2015). Fang et al. (2012) use China’s enforcement of the Compulsory Education Law since 1986. The law mandated a minimum nine years of education. Using the provincial difference in the dates of effective implementation of the Compulsory Education Law, they find that the law increased overall education years in China by about 0.8 years. The instrumental variable estimation shows that the returns to education are approximately 20%. However, by the time the Compulsory Education Law was enforced, urban children generally had received at least junior high-level education.==== As a result, the Compulsory Education Law cannot provide a robust estimate to the returns to education in urban China.====We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, the paper uses the changes in the duration of middle school as an alternative exogenous variation. Therefore, the paper provides a new insight into estimating returns to education in urban China using a new instrumental variable. Second, to our knowledge, our paper is the first that uses geographic variations at the county level to estimate the returns to education in China. China is a large country. There can be large geographical and economic variations within the province. Being able to control for county dummies helps to overcome the unobserved county characteristics that can affect both education and earnings. Finally, the paper tries to uncover the channels by which an extra year of schooling boosts income in an instrumental variable framework. Although previous research has broadly discussed possible education channels, they are estimated using an ordinary least square (OLS) framework and are therefore subject to the challenge of endogeneity.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows.

Using a local projection method, we find that deregulation pays off only gradually: its positive effect on output becomes statistically significant three to four years after the reform, consistent with the notion that entry takes time due to real frictions. At the same time, there is no evidence of any significant transitory cost. Over the medium term, these product market reforms eventually yield large, highly significant increases in output, concomitant with a relative price decline. The typical major historical reform in advanced economies increased real value added and employment in the deregulated industry by about 10 percent and over 5 percent, respectively, and lowered relative prices by some 8 to 10 percent, after five years.","Amid permanent output losses from the global financial crisis and a protracted decline in potential growth, structural reforms have been increasingly advocated by policymakers and institutions alike as a way to revive growth in advanced economies (e.g. Draghi, 2015; IMF, 2015, 2016; OECD, 2018). Product market reforms feature high on this agenda; even though widespread deregulation has already taken place across advanced economies in recent decades, there remains much scope for easing barriers to entry in retail trade, professional services, and some network industries in a number of advanced countries (Koske et al., 2015). In the United States, the need for, and potential gains from a new wave of product market deregulation and across-the-board cuts in red tape has been the subject of much debate and disagreement lately (see, for example, Cochrane, 2016; Davis, 2017; DeLong, 2016).====While the existence of long-term gains from easing barriers to entry in product markets has gradually become consensual since the seminal paper of Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003) (e.g. Ebell and Haefke, 2009; Fang and Rogerson, 2011; Felbermayr and Prat, 2011), their short- to medium-term impact remains debated by policymakers and academics alike, and it is largely unknown empirically. On the one hand, policymakers and international institutions have been increasingly advocated such reforms to speed up economic recoveries, notably in advanced economies in the aftermath of the global financial and euro crises of 2008–09 and 2010–12 (e.g. Draghi, 2015; OECD, 2018); indeed, this view motivated the inclusion of product market reforms in the individual macroeconomic adjustment programs of Southern European countries during the euro area crisis of the early 2010s. On the other hand, other scholars have pointed out that labor and product market reforms are in fact likely to pay out only very slowly (Rodrik, 2015) or may even entail short-run losses (e.g. Krugman, 2014). Addressing this question matters not only for the economics, but also for the political economy of reform; any short-term employment and output losses in deregulated industries would add one item to the long list of obstacles to reform identified in the literature (see e.g. Tommasi and Velasco, 1996). Against this background, this paper aims to explore empirically the short-to-medium-term of product market deregulation.====The benchmark framework to analyze the dynamic effects of reductions in entry costs arguably remains that proposed by Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003). In their static set-up, reductions in entry barriers of the type we study here increase output, employment, and real wages only in the long term, once new firms enter the market in response to the initial increase in expected profits. In the short term there is no impact, per an assumption that the number of firms is initially fixed. Some of the more recent theoretical papers incorporate entry barriers in a fully dynamic general equilibrium set-up, with endogenous variation in the number of monopolistically competitive firms as in Bilbiie et al. (2012). In these models, still in line with Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003), a reduction in entry costs triggers firm entry and gradually increases output, employment, and real wages; however, it entails short-term losses, partly reflecting the downsizing of incumbents and the need to finance entry (Cacciatore and Fiori, 2015; Cacciatore et al., 2016a, Cacciatore et al., 2016b). This strand of the theoretical literature assumes that firms maximize profits under monopolistic competition. Market structure and firm behavior need not systematically conform with this mainstream assumption in practice, due e.g. to oligopolistic structures and associated strategic behavior (e.g. Aghion et al., 2005), non-profit objectives (e.g. Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003) or the presence of X-inefficiency (Leibenstein, 1966). Some of these features could have implications for the short-term effects of deregulation, although these have not been studied to our knowledge. For example, relative to the aforementioned models, competition-increasing reductions in entry barriers are more likely to lead incumbents to shed labor and increase output and productivity in the presence of X-inefficiency and non-profit maximization prior to the reform—as might be expected, for example, from large state-owned enterprises in some sheltered industries. Therefore, empirical analysis is needed.====The present paper quantifies empirically the short- to medium-term impact of abrupt reductions in barriers to entry on sector-level output, employment, prices, investment, and productivity in the deregulated industries. The focus is on air transport, electricity and gas, rail and road transport, postal and courier activities, and telecommunications. These five large non-manufacturing industries provide key inputs to the rest of the economy (Bourlès et al., 2013), account for a sizeable share (over 12 percent on average across our sample) of total value added in the non-manufacturing business sector, and for an even bigger fraction of existing product market regulations in developed countries (e.g. Koske et al., 2015). Crucially for identification purposes, over our sample period, these industries have also undergone major deregulation that varied in timing and intensity across countries. In telecommunications, for example, the United States and the United Kingdom were early movers in the early 1980s, as part of the Reagan and Thatcher governments’ supply-side agendas. Another advantage of focusing on industry-level regulations is to enable us to build an empirical strategy that carefully addresses key sources of omitted variable bias, through a rich set of fixed effects that absorbs confounding country-level factors such as macroeconomic conditions. While the market structure of network industries features a few specificities—such as usually large fixed costs and a natural monopoly element in their upstream, non-competitive part—their economic and regulatory weight means that analyzing them can carry more general lessons regarding the short-term effects from removing barriers to entry in product markets.====A further reason for focusing on these five network industries is that, for each of them, we are able to uniquely map reform and outcome indicators thanks to a new reform dataset. Abrupt reductions in barriers to entry are identified based on a new narrative database of major reform events that compiles all large regulatory and legislative measures taken in each sector for 26 countries starting from the 1970s (Duval et al., 2018). There are two major advantages to this new dataset in the context of the present paper, over and above its broader country and time-series coverage: i) it covers major deregulation events whose scope goes beyond that of the regulatory indicators published by the OECD—for example, the breakup of U.S. telecommunications monopoly AT&T in 1982 following an anti-trust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice; ii) perhaps most importantly, it captures precisely the timing of reforms, which in some cases differs by one to two years from what would be inferred from large changes in OECD indicators of the regulatory stance (see Duval et al., 2018). For outcomes, we rely on the recent (2014) publication by the OECD of a more disaggregated version of its sectoral database STAN, which is now available at the ISIC Rev.4 level.====The unique mapping between reform events and sector-level outcomes yields a country-sector-time panel dataset that we then use to estimate the dynamic impact of major reform events over the five years from their implementation date. To this end, we rely on the local projection method (Jordà, 2005; Teulings and Zubanov, 2014), which has been used recently to study the dynamic impact of macroeconomic shocks such as financial crises (Romer and Romer, 2017) or fiscal shocks (Jordà and Taylor, 2013). We address carefully possible sources of omitted variable bias in two ways: first, through a rich set of fixed effects, most importantly controls for unobserved economy-wide (country-time) shocks that could potentially correlate with both reforms and outcomes; second, through IV techniques, using as external instruments for reform shocks the occurrence of reforms in the same sector in other countries and the initial regulatory stance.====Our empirical analysis yields two main findings. First, major reductions in barriers to entry deliver only gradually: output effects become statistically significant three to four years after the reform, as prices start dropping; somewhat surprisingly, however, there is no evidence of any transitory cost, apart from a short-lived drop in employment during the year of the reform that quickly turns into a rise—suggesting that the contraction or exit of some incumbent firms is quickly offset by the expansion and entry of others. Second, reductions in barriers to entry eventually yield large increases in output over the medium term, concomitant with a relative price decline; the typical major historical reform in advanced economies increased real value added in the deregulated industry by about 10 percent after five years.====The paper relates to the empirical literature on the economic impact of product market deregulation, its key contribution being to explore the short-term effects of reform in deregulated industries. A strand of studies using country-time or country-time-industry panel data documented a significant positive long-run effect of product market reform on productivity, investment, employment and/or output (e.g. Aghion et al., 2009a; Alesina et al., 2005; Bassanini and Duval, 2009; Conway et al., 2006; Fiori et al., 2012; Inklaar et al., 2008; Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2003). These studies rely on aggregate indicators of the overall regulatory stance in the network industries we analyze in the present paper. However, they typically do not control for country-specific macroeconomic conditions and are subject to omitted variable concerns more broadly. Some of the more recent studies exploit country-industry level data, and seek to partly address omitted variable bias by estimating the indirect impact of product market reform in non-manufacturing (network) industries on outcomes in other industries that use non-manufacturing goods and services as inputs. Their identification strategy draws on Rajan and Zingales (1998) and assumes that deregulation in “upstream” (network) industries should benefit disproportionately those “downstream” industries that make greater use of inputs from the deregulated upstream industries. They find supportive evidence, which could reflect the impact of deregulation in non-manufacturing industries on input variety and quality, or innovation rents, in other industries (Barone and Cingano, 2011; Bourlès et al., 2013). Duval and Furceri (2018) also document positive short-term spillovers from deregulation to upstream industries through increased input demand from the deregulated industries. Our paper explores the ==== impact of reforms on those deregulated non-manufacturing (network) industries themselves, and it focuses on the short term to shed light on the under-researched issues of how fast reforms pay off and whether they entail any transitory costs. Country-specific studies of deregulation in specific industries have documented positive long-run output and efficiency effects (e.g. from deregulation of network industries in the United States, see Winston, 1998), employment gains (e.g. in retail trade, see Bertrand and Kramarz, 2002; Skuterud, 2005), and favorable price impacts across deregulated industries (e.g. Winston, 1998), or in specific ones (e.g. road transport, see Combes and Lafourcade, 2005), during the 1980s and 1990s. While less studied, wages have generally been found to decline little, possibly because deregulation merely shrunk the wage premium of unionized workers vis-à-vis their non-unionized counterparts (Card, 1996, Hendricks, 1994). The paper also bears some connection to the firm-level literature on the impact of competitive pressures on innovation, technology adoption, and productivity (e.g. Aghion et al., 2004, 2005; 2009b; Arnold et al., 2016; Gal and Hijzen, 2016). Our focus here is on the dynamic effects of major reductions in barriers to entry for the deregulated sector as a whole, with the view to assessing the dynamic macroeconomic impact of these reforms. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, existing studies typically focus on the long-term impact of reform. They do not explore the short-term versus medium-term responses of outcomes to deregulation—a key focus of our paper, helped by the combination of a new narrative dataset of product market reforms with a local projection method.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and the methodology used for the construction of major reform events and provides stylized facts on the links between past reforms in the five non-manufacturing industries considered and the dynamics of output, prices, employment, investment and productivity. Section 3 describes the empirical setup. Section 4 presents the econometric results. Section 5 concludes.",How fast does product market reform pay off?

Considering the export behavior of 260 cities between 1997 and 2012, we confirm the well-established under-performance of domestic private firms in financially more vulnerable sectors compared to foreign affiliates in China. We show that a greater number of CCB branches raises domestic private-firm exports disproportionately more in financially-dependent sectors, which is in line with improved financing conditions for these companies. This improvement in export performance appears to result from both an increase in the number of destination countries and a decline in prices. CCB development is moreover associated with a reduction in the systematic disadvantage of domestic private firms relative to foreign-owned firms in export markets resulting from their greater financial exclusion. We, however, also find that private-firm export performance has deteriorated relative to that of state-owned firms, casting doubt on the ability of CCBs to end the systematic bias of lending in favor of the state sector.","China’s banking sector has undergone substantial restructuring in recent decades in an attempt to move away from its notoriously inefficient state-centered system (Dollar and Wei, 2007). Various rounds of reforms have focused on the commercialization of the four national state-owned banks that continue to dominate the banking sector. A no-less ambitious parallel approach pursued by the Chinese authorities consists in allowing the entry of successive waves of new types of financial institutions. Many developing countries have also pursued policies to liberalize their banking systems and have encouraged the arrival of new players, particularly foreign ones (Claessens and Van Horen, 2014). The precise assessment of the impact of the development of these new banks is therefore of great importance.====A particularly remarkable source of transformation and competition has come from the growth of the current 133 city commercial banks (CCBs), which first appeared in the mid 1990s: they presently account for 12.6% of Chinese banking assets.==== As the name suggests, CCBs were originally allowed to operate only within the city from which they originated. However, since 2004, they have been authorized to expand outside their home area. Their fast growth, better management, and innovative behavior are the driving forces behind the mounting effective market competition among banks (Ferri, 2009, Lin, Sun, Wu, 2015). In contrast to the national state-owned banks, whose lending remains focused on notoriously inefficient state-owned enterprises, CCBs target the growing demand for investment loans from local small and medium-sized enterprises, which have been the main engine of China’s rapid economic growth. This suggests a potential improvement in the famous misallocation of capital in China (Brandt, Tombe, Zhu, 2013, Hsieh, Klenow, 2009). However, to our knowledge there has been no empirical work on this issue. This paper begins to fill this gap.====The inefficiency of China’s financial system mainly stems from non-market distortions resulting from government policies (Allen, Qian, Qian, 2005, Dollar, Wei, 2007). The state-dominated banking system allocates credit mainly to support the development of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while the development of private enterprises has been impeded (Chen et al., 2016). One stylized fact in China’s malfunctioning banking system is the discrimination against domestic private firms (Brandt and Li, 2003). These credit constraints faced by Chinese private firms have been manifested in the systematic under-performance of private firms in export markets, especially in financially-dependent sectors, compared to firms with foreign ownership that can access foreign capital markets or funding from their parent companies (Manova et al., 2015). This paper asks whether the growth of CCBs has helped reduce this performance gap.====Our analysis of the repercussions of local financial development in China exploits data on sectoral exports for 260 cities between 1997 and 2012. We ask whether the development of city commercial banks across China has alleviated the constraints from China’s domestic financial market inefficiency on the export activity of domestic private firms. Our estimation strategy follows a large empirical literature pioneered by Rajan and Zingales (1998), identifying the effect of credit frictions via geographical variation in financial development and sectoral variation in financial vulnerability (Chaney, 2016, Manova, 2013). A number of heterogeneous-firm trade models with financial frictions support the use of export data to detect financial constraints and track their change over time (Besedeš, Kim, Lugovskyy, 2014, Manova, Wei, Zhang, 2015, Muûls, 2015). These models are based on the observation that access to export markets is more demanding than access to local markets in terms of external finance due to fixed entry costs, delays in cross-border transit, and greater risk. They thus formalize the intuition that if financial development helps tilt growth towards financially-dependent industries,==== then the impact of development should be accentuated for export growth.====Our focus on export performance instead of more traditional indicators of performance (such as economic growth, sales, productivity, financial returns, etc.) furthermore relates to various advantages of export data. The advantages of using export data to assess how the development of CCBs has reduced the credit constraints faced by private Chinese firms are three-fold. First, as our estimation strategy follows Rajan and Zingales (1998), we need data disaggregated by sector and city level. To our knowledge, GDP data broken down by sector are not available at the city level. They are also not detailed according to the type of firm ownership. Export data, contrary to production data, are disaggregated by product and city level and are available continuously over a longer and more recent period (1997–2012), which is key to our identification strategy. Various problems in the Chinese annual surveys of industrial firms, summarized by Brandt et al. (2014), would limit data on production or productivity to a subperiod of 1998–2007. This restriction is harmful since, as shown in Fig. 1, a large number of CCBs were created after 2007. Second, export data allow a much finer sectoral decomposition of activity than the production data where firms only report their main sector of activity. Moreover, while production data exclude private firms with revenues below five million yuan, export data cover the whole universe of exporting firms in China. Third, export data, compared to production data or financial data, are less likely to suffer from measurement or misreporting problems, which could severely bias the estimates.====We first build on Manova et al. (2015), who use 2005 data to show that foreign-firms, especially fully-foreign firms, suffer fewer financial constraints in China, possibly because they can access foreign capital markets or can obtain funding from their parent companies. We confirm this diagnostic over our data period (1997–2012): foreign affiliates and joint ventures exhibit better export performance than do domestic private firms in financially-vulnerable sectors. Our evaluation of the ongoing financial reforms in China tests the prediction that greater financial-system efficiency should affect the export structure of private firms. We expect the most financially-dependent sectors to be disadvantaged in environments where distortions are more significant, but benefit more from greater efficiency in the financial system.====Our key contribution is our focus on one specific component of the ongoing restructuring of China’s banking sector: the emergence of city commercial banks. We use the number of CCB branches in a city to measure local CCB development. Our main variable of interest is the interaction of CCBs with sectoral financial vulnerability. We identify the loosening of credit constraints with Chinese financial reform by seeing how the comparative export disadvantage of private firms in financially-vulnerable sectors falls with local CCB presence.====Our baseline results show that domestic private firms’ export performance rose faster in sectors with greater financial vulnerability when there were more CCBs, hence dampening the systematic disadvantage (via financial exclusion) of domestic private firms compared to foreign-owned firms in export markets. The development of CCBs then seems to have relaxed the financial constraints that weigh on local private firms. However, when using state-owned firm export performance to gauge the sensitivity of private-firm exports to financial frictions, we find that the relative performance of private firms has worsened. Hence, while CCBs appear to have extended lending to private firms, thus promoting a reallocation of their export activity to sectors with greater capital requirements, they have not reversed state firms’ preferential access to financing. The local financial development introduced by city commercial banks has not put an end to the systematic lending bias in favor of the state sector. These results are robust to controlling for the inclusion of fixed effects accounting for time-varying shocks to the city or the sector in a way that is specific to firm type. They also hold when we control for confounding factors such as the credit-constraint relaxing effects of economic development, foreign presence or foreign-bank entry. The results are further confirmed when we use alternative proxies for financial vulnerability.====We make three contributions to the literature. First, we are the first to our knowledge to evaluate the effect of local bank availability on domestic private firms in China. Our analysis adds to the emerging literature showing the importance of within-country variation in financial development, notably in developing countries (Brandt, Li, Roberts, 2005, Fafchamps, Schündeln, 2013, Guiso, Sapienza, Zingales, 2004, Kendall, 2012). It also contributes to the debate on the impact of the entry of new banks on access to credit for private companies in developing countries. The literature is indeed very divided on the relationship between firms’ credit constraints and the intensifying competition between banking institutions in developing countries. In particular, results on the direct effect of competition on the availability of bank credit to firms are mixed and depend on the countries included in the sample (Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, Maksimovic, 2004, Léon, 2015a, Petersen, Rajan, 1995).==== A study based on Chinese subnational data is therefore better able to measure the impact of financial reforms in China. Only a few papers have examined how the outcomes of Chinese financial-market reforms differ across China according to the local bank presence. Most have used measures of financial development at the level of the 31 Chinese provinces, a relatively aggregated level. Our count measure of city commercial bank branches provides much more spatial variation over a long period (1997–2012), and directly picks up the effect of new financial institutions on banking sector reform.====Second, previous work has also struggled with the endogeneity of financial development. The incentives for local authorities to intervene to create a city commercial bank in their jurisdiction are particularly strong in the Chinese context, where promotions for local executives are directly tied to economic growth and therefore to the implementation of favorable financial conditions (Li and Zhou, 2005). Our identification strategy interacts the financial-development measure with sectoral financial vulnerability, and further with dummies for firm-ownership type. More precisely, we do not require that the development of CCBs be exogenous to financial constraints. Our conclusions would in fact be strengthened under the likely scenario that CCBs developed in response to deficiencies in the state-banking sector (Girardin and Ping, 1997). Our panel of city-product-year export flows by firm type also allows us to control for city-year and product-year fixed effects, so that the estimated coefficients do not reflect particular shocks to cities or sectors in a given year.====Third, existing research on Chinese financial reform has mostly concentrated on the outcomes of GDP and productivity (Guariglia, Poncet, 2008, Lai, Qian, Wang, 2016, Wang, 2017). Despite the growing evidence of a link between financial development and export performance as well as the role of trade as an engine for development in China, little work has explicitly related banking reform to Chinese exports. Our focus on private firms is especially relevant here, as their exports grew at the impressive annual rate of 90% between 1997 and 2012, five times the average growth rate of Chinese exports. Our findings on the positive role played by CCBs with respect to the key Chinese export sector sheds light on an effective policy tool that can consolidate the benefits of Chinese economic opening. We also investigate the mechanisms at work behind the increase in private exports made possible by the development of CCBs. Export gains appear to pass through the destination margin: the easing of financial frictions seems to allow domestic private companies to export to more countries. We also find evidence, albeit less robust, suggesting that cheaper credit enables exporters to reduce their export prices, and therefore to export more.====In addition to the contributions cited above, our work relates to two other literatures. First, we provide an additional test of the well-known hypothesis that financially more-developed countries export relatively more from financially more-vulnerable industries (Beck, 2002, Manova, 2013). As we rely on regional variations within one single country (China), our identification strategy of comparing Chinese cities avoids the problem of omitted legal and institutional-system variables that arises in cross-country analysis. Second, we are in line with the empirical finding that FDI may relax domestic firms’ credit constraints (Harrison et al., 2004), notably in the Chinese context of state intervention in finance (Guariglia and Poncet, 2008). China’s financial repression has made it difficult for domestic private firms to enter into contracts with foreign buyers, creating fertile conditions for foreign firms to extend equity financing instead (Huang, 2003). Our results suggest that the relative advantage of FDI in mitigating the debilitating effect of malfunctioning national state-owned commercial banks on private exports falls as CCBs expand.====As we consider the emergence of city commercial banks, we effectively study a part of what Ferri (2009) refers to as the “New Tigers”. We confirm that CCBs are beneficial for domestic private firms. Ferri finds that the new banks perform better than the state-owned commercial banks that are burdened with non-performing loans from unprofitable state-owned enterprises. Our conclusion that CCB presence does not prevent preferential lending to state firms also resonates with the conclusion in Ferri (2009) that the “New Tigers” cannot by themselves solve China’s deep-rooted financial inefficiency, as state-owned commercial bank reform is necessary for better banking in China.====The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In the following section we describe the emergence of city commercial banks and provide preliminary evidence suggesting that the development of CCBs improves the financing of domestic private activities mainly by providing these firms with cheaper credit (deepening financial markets) rather than by increasing the number of those with access to a loan (broadening financial markets). Section 3 presents our data and financial-dependence indicators, and provides evidence that credit constraints restrict domestic private firms’ export activity. Section 4 sets out our empirical strategy to analyze the effects of city commercial banks on domestic private exports. In Section 5 we dig deeper into the mechanisms behind the measured rise in domestic private exports, and discuss the ability of CCBs to end discrimination against private companies compared to state-owned enterprises in terms of access to finance. The last section concludes.",Local financial development and constraints on domestic private-firm exports: Evidence from city commercial banks in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718305456,27 September 2019,2019,Research Article,198.0

The analysis highlights the role of the composition of aggregate demand as the main driving force, both for its direct effects on the income elasticity of imports, and for the indirect effects on export growth via capital accumulation, in particular fixed asset investment. Our analysis has important implications to understand China's transition to a “New Normal” of a lower growth rate and the effects of the external and internal rebalancing strategy pursued from the early 2000s.","A wide body of literature has studied China's growth experience since the 1980s. Most of this literature has used standard growth accounting decompositions of overall growth into the contributions of the growth rates of labor, capital, and total factor productivity (TFP). These growth analyses typically gravitate around discussions of the contribution to GDP growth of residually-estimated TFP growth versus that of capital accumulation. Most studies tend to conclude that the latter contributed significantly to China's GDP growth (the investment-to-GDP ratio reached about 50 percent), although the size of the contribution varies across studies and periods considered.==== Some studies indicate that the contribution of TFP growth is small, but very likely technical progress was embodied in capital, or technical progress was biased with an elasticity of substitution less than one, in which case standard TFP growth calculations lead to incorrect (too small) estimates of the latter (Felipe and McCombie, 2001, Felipe and McCombie, 2002). It is important to note that these analyses offer a supply-side explanation of growth (i.e., through the factors of production), and the implicit assumption is that growth is supply-constrained, and hence determined by the growth of supply.====While the role of capital accumulation in China's growth is undeniable, and certainly there has been significant technical progress (however measured), the country's remarkable growth performance over the last three decades has also been associated to a very robust growth of exports, so much so that many refer to it as a clear example of export-led growth (ELG).==== The standard literature on ELG has focused exclusively on the role of exports (e.g., Yao 2018, 42–44), either by estimating price and income export elasticities in export functions (e.g., Ang et al., 2015) or by investigating the growth effect associated with exports (e.g., Tingvall and Ljungwall 2012), typically relying on Granger-causality methods (e.g., Marin, 1992, Tang et al., 2015).====The main argument proposed in this paper is that, both in general and in the case of China, the ELG model is more complex than simply considering the role of exports. A first look at the data supports this view. Panel (a) of the Fig. 1 is a simple scatterplot of China's output growth rate and the growth rate of the volume of exports. It shows the expected positive correlation (significant at the 5 percent level) revealed by standard ELG studies. However, the relation between the two variables is very weak: a 1 percentage point growth in exports is associated with slightly less than 0.1 percentage point growth in output. Another indicator typically considered as a reflection of a successful ELG strategy is the improvement in the current account balance (as a share of GDP) – indeed, China's relevant current account surpluses in the 2000s have frequently been mentioned in support of the ELG hypothesis. Nevertheless, as shown in Panel (b), there is no evidence of a statistically significant correlation between China's current account (as a share of GDP) and the growth rate of its volume of exports. Similarly, changes in the current account (as a share of GDP) are not significantly associated with the dynamics of output growth. Though far from conclusive, this evidence suggests that, to analyze China's growth performance through the lens of the export-led growth model, we need to rely on a more comprehensive approach. In this paper, it is argued that such an approach must take into account the interaction between exports and imports as a key determinant of long-run growth performance.====There are powerful reasons why exports matter, and these provide the rationale for why countries gain by following an ELG strategy (McCombie and Thirlwall 1994). Particularly relevant is the fact that exports are the only component of demand that can pay for the import requirement (especially of capital goods) of growth. Surely an economy can experience consumption-led, investment-led, or government-expenditure-led growth; but each of these components of demand has an import content.==== If an economy does not obtain sufficient export earnings to pay for its imports (more precisely, the import content of other components of expenditure), then demand will have to be constrained. For this reason, exports play a very significant role. The evidence shows that countries, especially developing countries, need to maintain current account equilibrium in the long-run. Otherwise they run into crises. Indeed, the experience of many developing countries shows that, in the long run, they cannot grow faster than the rate consistent with balance-of-payments (BOP) equilibrium on current account, unless they can finance ever-growing deficits. There is a limit to the deficit-to-GDP ratio beyond which financial markets become nervous and a country is unable to borrow any more. Thus, countries that find themselves in BOP problems must constrain growth while the economy still has surplus capacity and surplus labor – indeed, there are not many developing countries that could not grow faster if they had more foreign exchange. This implies that exports not only have a direct effect on demand, but also an indirect effect by allowing all other components of demand to rise faster than otherwise would be the case. This helps us anticipate the result that the long-run rate of growth of an economy becomes attuned to the rate of growth of the dominant component of autonomous demand, which in an open economy is exports.====This paper contributes to the debates and literatures on ELG and China's growth in several ways. First, we offer an alternative (to the supply-side growth accounting) explanation of China's growth, one that allows us to consider explicitly the growth-enhancing effects of exports. In doing so, we offer a demand-side explanation of China's growth in terms of the ELG hypothesis. By this we mean that China's growth may well have been demand-constrained, especially when it is below its productive potential – in which case there is excess capacity, supply constraints are not binding, and GDP growth is determined by the growth of demand. This possibility is acknowledged by Lin et al., 238–242). We believe this hypothesis merits serious investigation.====Second, unlike the growth accounting approach, that relies on somewhat ==== assumptions about, for example, the future path of TFP growth (apart from the fact that its determinants are very unclear), this framework allows proper statistical testing.====Third, we make use of an approach that goes beyond regressions of output growth on export growth. There is a fairly robust literature that relies on the hypothesis put forward by Thirlwall (1979). The basis of this work is the contention that the relationship between output growth and exports needs to be analyzed in a BOP equilibrium framework, specifically considering not only the growth effect associated to exports but also the rise in imports brought about by fast exports and output growth. That is, export-led growth can be the pillar of a sustainable development process only if it relaxes the long-run constraint on growth imposed by the BOP. Under this view, a country's long-term growth performance will tend to converge toward that particular growth rate consistent with current account equilibrium – the balance of payments equilibrium (BOPE) growth rate.====Fourth, the paper provides several empirical contributions to the literature on BOPE growth, as well as to our understanding of China's growth. The most important is that we estimate a time-varying BOPE growth rate (====) for China. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such an exercise has been carried out and this is somewhat surprising, since the hypothesis that the BOPE growth rate is fixed over time is a restrictive one. This is particularly so for an emerging economy like China, which has undergone significant structural change in the past four decades. A second empirical contribution of this paper is that we rely on a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach to examine the factors driving the evolution of the BOPE growth rate in China.====Building on this approach, this paper addresses the following questions: (i) to what extent can the BOPE growth rate explain China's growth performance over the last three decades?; and (ii) what are the determinants of China's BOPE growth rate? These issues, interesting in their own right from a theoretical viewpoint, are now very important for policymakers too as after the Great Financial Crisis the Chinese economy has entered a new phase of slower economic growth, which some see as structural and heralding the beginning of a ‘New Normal’ for growth in China.==== We show that the trajectory of China's BOPE growth rate from the mid-2000s onwards is consistent with the gradual shift to a New Normal of slower growth.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 derives the BOPE growth rate, discusses its interpretation, and provides a discussion of why China's growth rate may indeed have been determined by its BOPE growth rate. Section 3 implements this methodology using annual data for 1981–2016. We find that the average value of the BOPE growth rate was about 11 percent but, consistent with our hypothesis, it varied significantly during the estimation period. In Section 4, we test how relevant (as an upper limit constraint) the BOPE growth rate has been to explain China's actual growth rate. The evidence is consistent with the notion that the trajectory of China's trend growth performance is closely associated to the dynamics of its BOPE growth rate. Section 5 focuses on the investigation of robust determinants of the BOPE growth rate and of the income elasticity of imports via BMA analysis. Our findings indicate that China's BOPE growth rate is primarily influenced by specific components of aggregate demand. In particular, export growth has acted as China's engine of growth and, at the same time, as a check on output growth via its direct and indirect effects on import growth and the balance-of-payments constraint. Section 6 dwells on the relationship between the recent trajectory of China's BOPE growth rate and the New Normal, focusing on the effects of the external and internal rebalancing strategy pursued by China from the early 2000s. Finally, Section 7 concludes and discusses policy implications.",The PRC's long-run growth through the lens of the export-led growth model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718303093,20 September 2019,2019,Research Article,199.0

The local government officials who have a high level of autonomy in terms of economic decision making engage in a competition that rewards better local economic performance with promotion within the bureaucratic nomenclature. The effectiveness of this promotion exercise to promote local economic growth has been studied both theoretically (Maskin et al., 2000) and empirically (Li, Zhou, 2005, Jia, Kudamatsu, Seim, 2015).====Conceptually, the promotion exercise is sometimes referred to as resembling a rank-order tournament labor contract,==== which can induce an efficient level of effort from workers under a properly designed pay structure (Lazear and Rosen, 1981). The pay structure in such a tournament is shown to be convex in the sense that the pay increase between rungs of career ladders becomes larger as one moves up the rank (Rosen, 1986). While such compensation schemes are found in sports and corporations (Ehrenberg, Bognanno, 1990, Eriksson, 1999), the public-sector pay scale of the Chinese officials almost certainly falls short of it. The “3581” Project implemented in Beijing in 2004 portrays a pay scale that starts from an annual salary of 30,000 ==== for township/sub-division level officials, 50,000 ==== for county/section level officials, 80,000 ==== for prefecture/bureau level officials and 100,000 ==== for province/ministry level officials. Leaving the absolute level of the salaries aside, the increase in the salary across the bureaucratic spectrum appears hardly high-powered enough to be compatible with a rank-order tournament.====One way out is to recognize that the observed salary is only a “capitulation wage” to be supplemented by, for instance, corruption income (Becker, Stigler, 1974, Besley, McLaren, 1993). Several international rankings of corruption indices confirm the impression that corruption is wide-spread in China (see a review in Svensson (2005)). However, letting the corruption income accrue disproportionately to the top officials is not compatible with the essential features of the Chinese institution. The centralized personnel management means that corruption is monitored and penalized in a top down fashion.==== This implies zero monitoring at the top. To minimize the potential massive abuse of power at the top, decentralizing economic management to lower-level governments effectively distances the top from a direct control over economic resources and limits the scope for corruption at the top.====So what is the ==== to the winner of the tournament? We provide an explanation of how the rank-order tournament incentive can work in a Chinese institutional background. In its most parsimonious form, there are three logical steps in the argument. First, corruption, interpreted as misuse of power in the allocation of economic resources for personal gains, occurs where economic decisions are made. Due to decentralized economic management, it can occur anywhere except the top. Second, corruption income cannot be fully consumed contemporaneously, and hence contributes to wealth accumulation that forms the basis of an official’s vested interest in winning the tournament. Third, the fact that the corruption inspection is implemented top-down means that the accumulated wealth is not safe until one rises to the top, and risen to the top, one can potentially benefit from being the inspector. Then, the grand prize at the top is not an opportunity to extract more rents, but the security with which to keep the wealth accumulated over one’s career. This view logically weaves growth, corruption, tournament, and key features of the Chinese institution into a coherent story.====We formalize the idea by embedding a rank-order tournament model in a model of career concerns similar to Qian and Xu (1993) and Maskin et al. (2000). We interpret the lower-level government officials as managers to whom production tasks are delegated and the top official as disciplinary inspector to whom a corruption monitoring task is delegated. The officials are organized in a bureaucracy and incentivized by a rank-order tournament labor contract. We model the informational frictions explicitly. First, the lower-level government officials who undertake production needs to exert costly effort, which is only privately observable. Second, these officials who undertake production faces an opportunity to grow private wealth at an above market rate, which captures the potential for rent-seeking or corruption. The decision to exploit such an opportunity is also private, and hence to reveal such wrong-doing would require a monitoring technology, which is delegated to the top government official, to be consistent with the centralized personnel management. Last but not the least, upon disciplinary inspection, the outcome of the investigation is observed only to the inspector or the top official. This creates potential for collusion between the inspector and the official under investigation, which presents another inefficiency (Tirole, 1992). We believe these are very realistic problems the Chinese society at large faces in dealing with bureaucrats in an institution that fundamentally lacks checks and balances.====Within this framework, we solve for the optimal choice for the level of disciplinary inspection as well as the incentive structure or the wage prizes offered at each stage of the tournament to maximize total output net cost of incentives. We show that the only level of disciplinary inspection that can be realistically implemented is a lax one, under which all officials are indifferent between being corrupt or not. This is a consequence of the deep-rooted informational frictions we model. With the epidemic of corruption inherent in the system, the optimal wage scale appears weak-powered. The savings in wages at the top are made possible by relying on bureaucrats’ private wealth building as implicit reward. At an early stage of development, incorporating bureaucrat’s personal wealth building as an implicit reward may not only be cost-saving, but also necessary when the state’s tax collection capability is low or the government’s budget is limited.====This paper makes two contributions. It is most closely related to the literature on the Chinese political institution, and in particular that on the Regionally Decentralized Authoritarian (RDA) regime (Du, Xu, 2007, Landry, 2008, Xu, 2011). We contribute to that literature by clarifying how a seemingly lower-powered public-sector pay scale is able to incentivize the government officials to work hard at promoting economic growth under the RDA regime. More generally, our results suggest that, during the course of development in China, good governance that produced tremendous economic growth may paradoxically require some level of corruption. This is especially true when the government budget is tight, so there is a limit to which one can use explicit wages to incentivize government officials. Formalizing this particular role of corruption in China’s development is our second contribution, which complements the literature on the role of corruption during economic development (Tirole, 1994, Banerjee, 1997, Laffont, N’Guessan, 1999). As the country grows richer and the government function evolves, the public-sector pay needs to adjust accordingly to elicit the efficient level of effort at all levels of the government.",A model of tournament incentives with corruption,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596719300873,20 September 2019,2019,Research Article,200.0

What is the optimal level of corruption for doing so? In this paper I use suspicious patterns of public procurement allocations in local government as a proxy measurement of corruption, based on combining quantitative and qualitative evidence on corrupt practices in local government. I then tie suspicious procurements to re-election probabilities of mayors in Croatian cities and municipalities from 2009 to 2017, and find that due to a rent-extracting relationship formed between firms and political elites, local politicians can engage in potential corruption and still win elections. There is an optimal level of suspicious procurements for which politicians maximize their re-election chances. When a mayor surpasses the cut-off level of around 20% of suspiciously allocated funds from public procurement his or her probability of re-election starts to decline, while he or she loses office for at least one half of all procurements allocated suspiciously. In order to address potential endogeneity issues I apply a fuzzy ==== based on population thresholds that determine the size of the local council, where the intensity of the treatment (potential corruption) increases with increasing council size. The results overall confirm the hypothesized nonlinear relationship between corruption and re-election.","Political economy theory posits that corrupt politicians holding power have every incentive to design a system that maximizes their probability of re-election as well as their rent-seeking behaviour (Brennan, Buchanan, 1980, Ferejohn, 1986, Persson, Tabellini, 2000, Besley, 2006). This is usually carried out through informal networks of interests where distributional benefits (jobs, exclusive contracts, favourable legislation, protectionism) are shared to actors within the network who in return promise political loyalty. The key to political survival lies in the effectiveness of such networks to preserve the systemic corruption that enables all the connected actors to keep extracting rents (Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, Siverson, Morrow, 2005, North, Wallis, Weingast, 2009). In practice this means that politicians holding power will engage into numerous deals with various special interests from which they can expect to receive electoral support (Coate, Morris, 1995, Mc Chesney, 1997, Grossman, Helpman, 2002, Gilens, 2012, Gilens, Page, 2014, Coviello, Gagliarducci, 2017). In a co-dependent system based on close personal ties where concessions are traded in return for votes, bribes, or other kind of support, all members of a network have every incentive to preserve their status quo and keep corrupt politicians in power for as long as possible.====In this paper I examine whether corruption formed through such informal networks has any effect on re-election chances of local politicians. I present a hypothesis that the mechanism through which corruption affects electoral chances is non-linear. Whether voters punish corruption is contingent on two factors: size of a city’s budget which presents different rent-extracting opportunities, and whether they play a repeated game with politicians and are able to update their beliefs given new information. The empirical section only tests the first factor.====Corruption is defined by observing suspicious public procurement contracts administered by local mayors to politically-connected private firms (as done by Fazekas, Toth, King, 2016, Ferwerda, Deleanu, Unger, 2017 or Fazekas and Kocsis, 2017). I use a combination of qualitative and quantitative evidence to capture the elements of potential fraud in the procurement process. The quantitative part of the definition rests upon detailed data on local public procurements in 556 Croatian cities and municipalities, conducted in the period of two consecutive local government mandates, the first one from 2009 to 2013, and the second one from 2013 to 2017. From the database on almost 140,000 public procurement contracts I single out various cases which present a reasonable doubt in the regularity of the procurement procedure, defining them as ====. Examples include cases in which firms with no employees and as a single bidder on the tender receive multiple contracts worth millions, cases in which firms sign contracts that vastly exceed their capabilities, and cases when firms with substantial losses receive indirect subsidies through lucrative deals that cover their losses entirely.====However, many of the aforementioned procurement irregularities may simply point out to specific patterns within the allocation process that need not imply corruption. The observed allocation outcomes may be a product of limited competition, government inefficiency or negligence, or are a direct consequence of the procurement process and the institutions that enforce it. Decarolis (2014), for example, finds that the trade-off between low prices of the awarded contract and poor ex-post performance is a direct consequence of bad institutional design of the procurement process and not necessarily corruption.====In order to strengthen the implication that corruption does indeed arise from such suspicious allocations I conducted interviews with key stakeholders in the procurement process, including special police criminal investigators, local government procurement officers, and anti-corruption watchdogs to validate my definitions on how to recognize potential corruption in the existing procurement data. The summaries of these interviews are presented in Online Appendix B, where each definition of a potentially fraudulent procurement is justified. The qualitative evidence confirms that the identified incidences of suspicions procurements are indeed good proxies for actual corruption in the procurement process. Whenever a criminal investigation uncovered fraud and corruption in public procurements it involved either a firm with a high share of revenues from procurement contracts, a firm with zero employees and the only bidder at an auction, or a firm which had losses and made profits the year after signing the contract. These are the usual red flags that encourage a criminal investigator to open a fraud investigation.====This valuable insight aligns my definition of suspicious procurements with the institutionalized corruption index presented in Fazekas et al. (2016); an index based on observing instances of restricted competition and recurring contracts to the same company. The definitions of corruption proxies in this paper therefore expand the literature definition of suspicious procurements to account for evidence of how procurement frauds are committed in practice. A methodological contribution of the paper is not the classification of specific procurement contracts as corruption, but the usage of qualitative evidence to confirm suspiciously identified patterns within the procurement process and thus provide a direct link that captures potential collusion between mayors and local bidders (as in Coviello and Gagliarducci (2017)), and whether a potentially fraudulent contract delivers any kind of electoral benefit to the mayor. The hypothesis is that due to personal connections and mutual dependence between local rent-extracting firms and the local political establishment, mayors can engage in corruption without having to sacrifice their chances of winning elections. Moreover mayors have a greater probability of staying in power if they create an informal network of interests that enables and encourages corruption.====The biggest contribution is presented in the empirical section. I find evidence of a statistically significant effect of corruption on re-election, confirming the hypothesized non-linear relationship. Corrupt practices entail a concave effect on re-election chances, meaning that corruption can increase the probability of re-election, however only until a certain cut-off after which corruption is too high and politicians get punished. I successfully bridge the gap between two competing hypotheses of whether voters punish corruption — they do, but not until it becomes too large and too noticeable. I calculate an optimal level of corruption to keep a politician in power. Probability of re-election is maximized for about 20% of all suspiciously allocated funds from public procurement. If more than 50% of all procurement is allocated suspiciously, a politician very likely loses power.====Because this relationship could potentially be subject to selection bias I apply a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design based on population thresholds that determine the size of the local council. The fuzzy design is used since the intensity of the treatment — proxy level of corruption — increases with increasing council size, while the as good as random assignment of local units into treatment and control groups is generated at each population threshold. The results of the RD estimation confirm the conclusion of a non-linear relationship between corruption and re-election. However, the fuzzy RD empirical strategy still cannot provide true randomization given that the data at hand does not come as a result of experimental conditions. The empirical section discusses at great length a number of budgetary, socio-economic, and political factors that are controlled for, however there could still be unobserved factors that change discontinuously at the thresholds even when observing them within very narrow bandwidths. It is therefore difficult to impose a direct causal implication, but the given empirical strategy is the most viable alternative to estimating the correct treatment effect and confirming the existence of a non-linear relationship between corruption and re-election.====The following sections present the contributions in greater detail. Section 2 presents the underlying theory and describes the hypothesized non-linear mechanism. It also briefly discusses why Croatia offers a good empirical test of this theory. After describing the data and the measurement procedure behind six different proxy variables of corruption in Sections 3 and 4, the empirical section presents the full set of results on the relationship between corruption and re-election. The final section concludes and presents implications for further research.",Corruption and re-election: how much can politicians steal before getting punished?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718306127,17 September 2019,2019,Research Article,201.0

Our analysis is based on a unique four-wave panel of the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey for the period between 2003 and 2012. Adopting the Five Factor Model of personality structure, and using it in the evaluation of non-cognitive skills, our results suggest that the personality trait ==== increases the probability of migration. On the other hand, the non-cognitive skills ==== are found to be negatively associated with the propensity to migrate. The impact of an increased willingness to take risks is more complex in that it increases the proclivity to move from rural areas to cities but lowers the migration intention from rural areas to towns. The effects are quantitatively significant and are robust to several sensitivity checks, including tests of reverse causality.","A growing body of economics literature has been investigating the role of non-cognitive skills, often referred to as soft skills or personality traits, in predicting micro-economic behavior. In this literature non-cognitive skills, besides cognitive abilities, are documented as important determinants of labor productivity, wages, occupational choices and job search behavior (see Kautz et al., 2014 for a summary). Conceivably, geographic mobility is among those life outcomes which non-cognitive skills might predict. Yet only little is known about the role of non-cognitive skills for individual migration decisions (e.g., Bütikofer, Peri, Caliendo, Cobb-Clark, Hennecke, Uhlendorff). Our study contributes to this scarce literature by providing evidence on the impact of non-cognitive skills on the decision to migrate within a transition country. The country of our study, Ukraine, is according to World Bank rankings in the upper bracket of lower middle-income countries. The paper shows that non-cognitive skills have an impact on rural to urban migration in a country of this income level. Our estimation results also provide evidence that individuals in better off households are more likely to migrate. Hence it is inconceivable that poverty is the main driver of rural to urban migration in Ukraine and that our findings stem from an effect of poverty on non-cognitive skills, and only subsequently on the decision to migrate.====Considering migration behavior within a resource allocation framework, people migrate to realize their labor market potential as far as its benefits outweigh the costs. The costs of migration increase with greater uncertainty about other locations, particularly about the housing market, labor market and education opportunities. In this respect, risk attitudes have a high predicting power in explaining the migration decision as recently documented by Jaeger et al. (2010) and Bauernschuster et al. (2014). Apart from the mobility costs due to market imperfections or the time and effort spent to search for and get familiar with a new job, there are other non-monetary considerations involved in migration such as the emotional burden of leaving familiar surroundings, family and friends, and adapting to a different cultural environment. These so-called “psychic” costs might increase the costs of moving perceived by individuals (Sjaastad, 1962).====While the non-pecuniary costs of migration are real costs, they are not easy to measure, since they are subject to a subjective evaluation by each person. Self-assessment of these costs may be quite different even among persons with very similar observable demographic and socio-economic characteristics. We argue that how individuals perceive these costs might be related to personality characteristics. Certain characteristics such as openness to new experience may help people perceive these costs to be lower, while other skills may make people strongly attached to their communities and thus perceive the costs of leaving as higher. Here, we pursue the question what types of non-cognitive skills might make individuals perceive a lower (higher) cost and thus generate more (less) willingness to migrate.====Not only perceived costs but also the expectation of future benefits is a crucial factor in the migration decision. As first suggested by Harris and Todaro (1970), individuals in the countryside are considering moving to urban areas because they expect to earn higher wages in the formal urban sector. The wage disparity could be linked to differences in the productivity of non-cognitive skills in urban areas, which would represent the so-called “non-behavioralâǥ explanation of the findings. However, not everyone moving to an urban area finds a formal sector job, many of the migrants end up in informal employment. Even if the expected wage of migrants therefore does not exceed the wage earned in the rural area, there can be large migratory flows from the countryside to cities since many individuals are convinced that they will find formal employment. It seems reasonable to assume that personality traits and risk preferences can influence the assessment of future gains connected with the migration decision. In the case of risk preferences, it seems intuitive that risk-loving persons have a more optimistic assessment of potential future gains than risk averse individuals do. Therefore, considering the channel of potential benefits, our prior would be that there is a positive correlation between the willingness to take risks and the decision to migrate.====On the other hand, there is no literature in a transition or developing context that links personality traits to the expectation of future benefits arising from rural to urban migration. We can moot, though, that individuals who, for example, are open to new experiences assess the potential gains more positively than persons who do not exhibit this trait. It strikes us also as reasonable to assume that very conscientious people regard potential future gains arising from migration with more scepticism than persons who lack conscientiousness. Therefore, openness to new experiences should be positively, conscientiousness negatively linked to the decision to migrate.====In this paper, we do not develop a theoretical model that shows the link between non-cognitive skills and rural-to-urban migration. Our goal is to identify those non-cognitive skills that are important predictors of migration in a consistent fashion. We would argue that the link between non-cognitive skills and risk preferences and migration could work through the channel of perceived costs and/or through the channel of expected benefits. However, the data at our disposal do not allow us to distinguish between these two channels.====The focus of this study is rural-to-urban migration in Ukraine. Rural-to-urban migration is an especially important type of mobility in a transition country context, since it has the potential to foster economic growth by reallocating workers from economically lagging-behind regions to large urban centers, where returns to human capital are higher. For the empirical analysis, we use the four waves of the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS). In addition to rich information on individual and labor market characteristics, the ULMS includes direct measures of attitudes towards risk in the survey years of 2007 and 2012 and a module with 24 items on non-cognitive skills added in 2012. Using this skill module we assess non-cognitive skills based on the widely accepted ‘Big Five’ taxonomy developed in the personal psychology literature (Goldberg, 1990, John, Srivastava, 1999, Lang, John, Lüdtke, Schupp, Wagner, 2011) and well taken in the economics literature (e.g., Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman, Ter Weel, 2008, Gill, Prowse, 2016). The taxonomy measures five character skills: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. We propose a mapping of the 24 items into the Big Five domains, utilizing the facets of these domains characterized by John and Srivastava (1999).====Our results suggest that openness to new experience increases the probability of an individual to migrate from rural to urban areas. On the other hand, conscientiousness and agreeableness are negatively correlated with the propensity to migrate. The effects are driven both by movements from rural areas into large cities and by movements from rural areas into towns. However, we find no consistent evidence supporting an association of neuroticism and extraversion with the migration propensity. The willingness to take risks has countervailing effects when it comes to moves into cities and moves into towns, impacting on migration positively in the former case and negatively in the latter. The magnitudes of the impacts of non-cognitive skills and risk attitudes are at any rate substantial considering unconditional rural-to-city and rural-to-town migration probabilities of about 1.5% each. Our results are also consistent with the previous evidence by Jaeger et al. (2010) and Bauernschuster et al. (2014), showing that risk-loving people are more likely to migrate. Performed tests also indicate that a full model, which uses the Big Five factors and risk preferences jointly, fits the data better than models that use them separately. Moreover, we provide evidence that the estimated effects of personality and risk attitudes are not driven by reverse causality.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first economic study that explores the effects of the Big Five factors on migration decisions in a middle income country. In addition, we use measures of personality traits and measures of risk preferences jointly as predictors of the probability to migrate and show that these measures are complementary rather than substitutes. Finally, in spite of its importance the nexus between non-cognitive skills and migration has been little studied in the literature because of data limitations; hence, our study provides important and very consistent evidence regarding this understudied topic.====In the following section, we provide some background information about demographic developments and migration patterns in Ukraine. Section 3 presents a brief summary of the pertinent literature on the link between non-cognitive skills and life outcomes and embeds our paper into this literature.

Using population census data combined with county-level information, we apply a difference-in-differences strategy to compare the educational outcomes of cohorts born before and after USI across counties with different iodine deficiency disorder levels.

The costs of USI almost evenly fell on China's iodine salt consumers through an in-price ====.","Scholars have long recognized a deficiency in the consumption of essential micronutrients as a primary impediment of health and human capital formation. Among various types of micronutrient deficiencies, iodine deficiency disorder (henceforth, IDD) has been the leading cause of preventable mental retardation (Ahmed, 2008).==== Iodine deficiency ==== has irreversible detrimental impacts on the development of the infant nervous system, which ultimately limits the development of cognitive ability and hinders human capital formation.==== There is substantial scientific evidence that the critical determinant of IDD prevalence is the iodine content in food and drinking water from which iodine intake is almost entirely derived (Murray et al., 2008). Iodine content in soil and water differs widely across localities as a result of the geological transformation between the sea and continental areas in ancient geological times. Therefore, IDD is a typical endemic disease.==== According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, nearly two billion people throughout the world live in iodine-deficient areas, a third of which are of school age (World Health Organization, 2007). WHO recommends universal salt iodization (USI) as the cheapest and most efficient way to prevent IDD, especially for developing countries with large populations living in iodine-deficient areas.====This paper estimates the effect of China's USI policy – the largest nutrition intervention policy in human history – on children's later-life educational outcomes. China had over 700 million people living in areas suffering from IDD in the early 1990s. To eliminate IDD by 2000, the Chinese government initiated a USI policy on October 1, 1994, which mandated the iodization of edible salt throughout the country. Using China's 2005 population mini-census data combined with county-level information, we apply a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy which compares the outcomes of children born before and after the USI policy in 1994 across counties with different IDD prevalence levels. We find that the USI policy significantly increases primary school enrollment for the policy-affected cohorts in high goiter counties by 0.6 percentage points.==== The costs of USI almost evenly fell on the iodized salt consumers through an in-price tax levied by China's central government. Therefore, our findings yield clear redistribution implications.====China's USI policy serves as an ideal natural experiment to examine the causal effects of salt iodization for two reasons. First, a state monopoly on salt in China ensured strict nationwide enforcement of USI and ruled out the potential endogeneity of producing or consuming iodized salt, which may threaten a causal analysis of the policy effect. China instituted state monopolization of salt production, distribution, and sales beginning in 1990. Specifically, China's central government authorized China Salt Industry Corporation, a central state-owned enterprise, other local state-owned enterprises in the salt industry, and local branches of these enterprises throughout the country to monopolize the production, distribution, and sales of edible salt. Second, before the enactment of USI, China had the largest population in the world exposed to IDD and exhibited rich regional heterogeneity in IDD levels. The Chinese government conducted an iodine deficiency census in the 1980s, which furnishes us with a comprehensive dataset with rich county-level information, including IDD prevalence and water iodine content.====Our DID analysis is built on a solid analytical foundation. We find that there are no differential pre-trends of primary school enrollment across counties with different goiter prevalence rates. Our results are highly robust to a full battery of robustness checks and falsification tests. We use county-level water iodine content as an instrumental variable to deal with potential measurement error and nonrandomness in the spatial distribution of IDD prevalence. Although we have no direct measure of children's cognitive ability to certify the mechanism, we provide evidence that the USI policy does not work through improving children's physical health.====The effect of the USI policy on primary school enrollment in China is heterogeneous across several important soci-oeconomic dimensions. We find that the USI policy effect almost exclusively shows up in rural areas rather than in urban areas with much better access to alternative ways of overcoming IDD (e.g., through seafood consumption) and girls benefit more from the USI policy. These findings forcefully suggest that the USI policy is desirable not only on efficiency terms but also on social justice grounds.====To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first empirical studies to investigate the causal effect of China's nationwide USI intervention on educational outcomes. In terms of research theme, this paper contributes to a growing body of scholarship evaluating the effects of various types of early-life micronutrient supplements on later-life outcomes, such as iron (Bobonis et al., 2006, Chong et al., 2016, Banerjee et al., 2018) and iodine (Field et al., 2009, Politi, 2014, Feyrer et al., 2017, Adhvaryu et al., forthcoming, Bengtsson et al., 2019). This paper is not the first research to examine the effects of the eradication of iodine deficiency disorders on educational outcomes. In a pioneering work, Field et al. (2009) gage a magnitude of 0.35–0.56 years of additional years of schooling for children treated ==== with iodine oil through an iodine supplementation policy in Tanzania. However, a replication work by Bengtsson et al. (2019) fail to establish a significant positive effect on educational attainment even when they use a larger sample and improve the precision of the treatment variable. Taking advantage of Switzerland's iodized salt introduction campaign, Politi (2014) documents a one percentage point increase in the secondary school graduation rate and a 0.7 percentage point increase in the tertiary school graduation rate. Motivated by another historical natural experiment, the fast salt iodization campaign in the United States in 1924, Feyrer et al. (2017) find that this campaign had a significant effect on intelligence quotient when delving deeply into a unique dataset compiled from draft physicals for American army enlistees during World War I and World War II. Adhvaryu et al. (2019)’s analysis builds on the same historical natural experiment and provides evidence of considerable effects on labor force participation and income. However, the effect they find is smaller and insignificant in the subsample of males. In a word, reliable causal evidence, especially evidence from developing countries, is still inadequate to forcefully argue that large-scale salt iodization intervention causally improves educational outcomes. A formal empirical investigation into China's USI policy is itself of vital importance since it has a long-lasting impact on over 20% of the world's population. Our finding also serves as a counterweight to recent clamor and advocacy in China for abolishing USI.==== Since most people might be unconscious of or underrate potential gains from micronutrient supplementation, policymakers should be cautious in handling this issue of important policy relevance.====Our study is closely related to a large and expanding literature on ==== (FOH), which examines the short- and long-term effects of specific factors ==== on later-life outcomes.==== The recent FOH literature exhibits an increasing interest in examining the effects of positive policy-driven ==== interventions on later-life outcomes (Bharadwaj et al., 2013, Almond et al., 2018, Nilsson, 2017). Researchers and policy-makers are especially eager to know whether some intervention policy tools derived from well-established causal evidence in scientific laboratory experiments or randomized controlled trials deliver their anticipated results when scaled up and implemented through government policies.==== We contribute to this literature by investigating the causal effects of a nationwide health policy intervention in China on the early cognitive development of children (indirectly measured by educational outcomes).====Finally, our research speaks to a hotly debated issue about the role of geographic factors in shaping regional income disparities (Diamond, 1997, Sachs, 2003, Nunn and Puga, 2012, Henderson et al., 2017). Endemic diseases play a crucial role in translating geographic factors into human capital accumulation and regional development. Our findings advance existing studies by highlighting how imperceptible geographic-specific disparities can perpetuate unequal human capital endowments from the very beginning of human life. We also show that well-designed and strictly implemented government policy inventions can help to overcome geographical disadvantages.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 introduces China's IDD prevalence, China's state monopoly of salt starting in 1990, and national implementation of the USI policy in 1994.

Although with no well-developed financial and legal systems, China witnesses a boom of private sector, which has contributed to most of its economic growth during the past three decades. Using inter-census population survey and economic census data, I find that the clan is positively associated with the likelihood of entrepreneurship and the share of economy in the private sector. Exploring possible mechanisms, I find that the clan helps privately-owned enterprises overcome financing constraints and escape from local government's “grabbing hand”. In addition, the clan is significantly related to a set of ====, which are arguably relevant for private business. Finally, I find that the support of clans for private business is limited as clans deter private businesses from growing into large firms. The results also suggest that the role of clans reduces as formal institutions develop.","It has been well studied that entrepreneurship is crucial for economic growth and development (Baumol, 1990, Baumol and Strom, 2007, Schmitz, 1989), particularly in less-developed economies (Bruton et al., 2008, McMillan and Woodruff, 2002). One of the key research questions in economics is how to direct a country's resources into entrepreneurial activities that improve the economic performance and contribute to a country's prosperity (King and Levine, 1993, Murphy et al., 1991).====Previous studies argue that institutional context is the main determining factor of private business as it affects individuals’ leverage of personal resources toward entrepreneurial opportunities (Baker et al., 2005, McMullen et al., 2008). It has also long been considered that well-developed legal and financial systems are necessities for economic growth (Allen et al., 2005). However, well-developed institutions are usually nonexistent in developing countries. Instead, private business in developing economies is often hampered by excessive bureaucracy (Djankov and Murrell, 2002), inefficient tax systems (Estrin et al., 2006, Guriev, 2004, Hellman et al., 2003, Johnson et al., 2000), and the distorted allocation of financial resource (Li et al., 2006). Without market-supporting institutions, private entrepreneurs have to rely on other forms of support to conduct business. For examples, entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe and Russia have been observed going underground to escape over-regulation and high taxes (Friedman et al., 2000, Johnson et al., 1997, Johnson et al., 1998). Firms in Vietnam depend on informal credits from suppliers when they have limited access to formal financial markets (McMillan and Woodruff, 1999a).====This paper contributes to the literature by examining the role of clans in entrepreneurial activities and development of the private sector. The clan is one of the most important social organizations in pre-modern China. It creates and enforces rules and norms, which are generally defined as informal institutions by North (1991). Greif and Tabellini, 2010, Greif and Tabellini, 2017) argue that the clan was the locus of cooperation in pre-modern China. As a kinship-based unit of cooperation, the clan “sustained cooperation among members, regulated interactions with non-members, provided local public or club goods, and coordinated interactions with the market and with the state”(Greif and Tabellini, 2017). The clan culture, as a reflection of a clan organization, is also the hallmark of Chinese culture. There is a recent but rapidly growing literature demonstrating that culture is relevant for economic development and economic choices. Some pioneering works reviewed by Guisoet al. (2006) show that culture has broad impacts on economic outcomes through its effects on individual preferences or values, and some influences change quite slowly.==== More recently, Alesina and Giuliano (2015) show that culture interplays with formal institutions and that they both affect economic performance.====Building on this literature, this paper examines the role of clans, either as social organizations or cultural traditions, in the unprecedented development of China's private sector during the transition process. Similar to most transition or developing countries, there are also no well-developed financial and legal systems in China, and financial constraints and excessive bureaucracy significantly impede the development of private business (Allen et al., 2005, Feng and Wang, 2010). Nevertheless, in spite of the underdevelopment of market-supporting institutions, the private sector in China has still made significant advances during the past three decades, especially in some regions (Fig. 1). Based on China's 2005 inter-census population survey data, the private sector employment share in the country's two most developed provinces, Zhejiang and Guangdong, is 76 and 57 percent, respectively. According to the National Bureau of Statistics' annual statistical reports, approximately 80 percent of net new jobs in China's urban area, during the past decade, were created by POEs.====In this paper, I first estimate the effect of clans on entrepreneurship and the share of economy in China's private sector, using population and economic census data. I find that clans lead to a higher occurrence of entrepreneurship, and larger employment and asset shares of POEs. An “epidemiological approach” analysis suggests that these findings are unlikely driven by local confounding factors, and verifies that the culture channel from clans to private business exists. The results are also robust to measuring local strength of clans at higher administrative levels, sample restriction, and the inclusion of historical confounding factors. As a further robustness check, I show that the effects of the clan exist only among Han Chinese but are absent among ethnic minorities. This is consistent with the fact that clan culture is mainly prevalent among Han Chinese, while minorities generally hold different religious beliefs. This suggests that the relationship between the clan and private businesses is unlikely due to unobservable local characteristics shared by all ethnic groups.====I then explore possible mechanisms. Using survey data from 10 percent of manufacturing firms in China, I find that the clan helps POEs overcome financing constraints and escape from local governments’ “grabbing hand” through tax system and other regulations. In contrast, I find no evidence of such advantages for non-POEs. I then use household survey data to show that the clan is closely related to a set of individual values, which are arguably relevant for private business. Given these findings, I conclude that the clan influences economic development through affecting both the local business environment and individual values.====Although the overall findings demonstrate a positive effect of the clan on China's private sector development, the effect could be limited as some of the cultural traits of Chinese clans, such as limited moral obligation and strong family ties, may in some cases negatively affect private business. After all, the merit of clans only stands out in the absence of well-developed market-supporting systems, making current private sector development the “second-best” (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956). Consistently, I find that POEs in regions with stronger strength of clans are significantly smaller in size. These findings suggest that the clan facilitates the opening of private firms, which are mainly family businesses in China, but deters them from growing into large firms. Moreover, I find that the positive relationship between the clan and private sector development is significantly weaker in regions with a better market environment, suggesting that the role of clans diminishes as formal institutions develop.====These findings contribute to several aspects of the ongoing literature. First, the findings build up the existing literature that investigates the determinants of entrepreneurship and private sector development by examining the effects of informal institutions (i.e. cultural norms).==== Previous literature generally focuses on formal institutions, such as legal or financial systems, leaving the role of informal institutions untouched (Allen et al., 2005, Baker et al., 2005, Danis and Shipilov, 2002, Djankov and Murrell, 2002, Estrin et al., 2006, Feng and Wang, 2010, Li et al., 2006, McMillan and Woodruff, 1999a, McMillan and Woodruff, 1999b, McMullen et al., 2008). Second, the findings provide new evidence on the causal mechanism between culture and economic outcomes and also provide novel evidence on the interaction between culture and formal institutions (Alesina and Giuliano, 2015, Fernandez, 2010, Guiso et al., 2006). Finally, as development of the private sector has been contributing to most of China's economic growth and is closely related to local economic performance (Li et al., 2012), the findings also add to a large strand of literature on China's post-reform economic growth and regional development by providing a novel perspective. Previous literature on China's economic growth generally focuses on the formation of physical capital (Chow, 1993, Zhang and Zou, 1998), infrastructure construction (Demurger, 2001, Fan and Zhang, 2004), and structural transformations (Fan et al., 2003, Kanbur and Zhang, 2005, Lin and Liu, 2000, Song et al., 2011), but few have examined the role of Chinese culture. Highlighting the role of culture in economic growth is especially insightful in the context of China, as Chinese culture is quite different from that in Western countries.====The rest of this paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 introduces the clan in China, and its traits, which are arguably relevant for private business. Section 3 describes the data. In Section 4, I estimate the effects of the clan on entrepreneurship and private sector development, and conduct several robustness checks. Section 5 then turns to mechanisms, investigating the effects of the clan on the local business environment and individual values. In Section 6, I further discuss limitations of the role of clans, and the interaction between clans and formal institutions. Section 7 concludes.","Clans, entrepreneurship, and development of the private sector in China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718300477,3 September 2019,2019,Research Article,204.0

Drawing on a unique survey of large, formerly state-owned urban industrial firms in Russia, we explore how ==== reforms affect the pace at which this legacy is being erased. For various historical, political, and economic reasons, there is substantial variation across firms as to their ownership of the land on which they sit. Despite facing no additional formal constraints, those that do not own their plots rent them out at a lower frequency than those that have acquired private tenure to their land. The privatization of plots, in other words, promotes the development of a rental market that transfers land use rights away from socialist-era industrial users. We address the potential endogeneity of land tenure using a measure of regional variation in urban land policy and Communist party vote shares as instrumental variables.","Eurasia's now defunct socialist systems made industrial location decisions in relative ignorance of land's opportunity cost and thus produced inefficiently laid out, factory-dominated cityscapes (Bertaud and Renaud, 1997). Russia, as much as any country, reaped this legacy and, in spite of the dramatic reforms of the early 1990s, has seen it endure to the present day. Market forces, that is, have been slow to reallocate Russia's urban land to new users more capable of exploiting its value. Large swaths of real estate in the country's largest cities have remained stubbornly attached to old industrial firms even as new and more dynamic firms complain of problems acquiring suitable land (Bertaud, 2010, World Bank 2012). Ironically, the country with the world's largest landmass appears to suffer from a scarcity of urban land (McKinsey Global Institute 1999, Muir and Shen, 2005, Survey of Land and Real Estate Transactions in the Russian Federation 2006, Zhuravskaya et al., 2005).====Why have newly liberalized markets been so slow to reallocate urban plots from old to new users? Our answer here draws attention to the role of land tenure institutions. Russia's slow privatization of land underneath otherwise privately-owned enterprises appears to have delayed the de-industrialization of the country's hyper-industrialized cities. To demonstrate this point, we exploit a unique survey, rich in land-related detail, of managers at large privatized urban industrial firms. Despite facing no additional formal constraints, those that have not taken ownership of their plots rent them out at a lower frequency than those that have acquired private tenure to their land. The privatization of plots, we show, promotes the development of a rental market that transfers land use rights away from socialist-era industrial users.====While this correlation between urban land tenure and urban land reallocation is consistent with a causal relationship, it is not interpretable as such given that land rights may be endogenous. We address this concern in two ways. First, we introduce a proxy of a firm-specific proclivity for market-oriented activity, a potential factor that could give rise to a spurious relationship between land tenure status and land market activity. Specifically, we augment the indicator of private land tenure to include firms which plan to take ownership of their plot in the future. We find that this variable is not correlated with renting out land. That is, consistent with a causal story, only current, not current plus planned, private tenure status explains current rental activity.====Second, we take advantage of substantial land policy variation across Russia's territorial units to instrument for the tenure status of a firm's land plot. The region (or territorial subject) in which a firm is located has an exogenous effect on the current tenure status of a firm's land. The source of exogenous variation is driven by the predetermination of a firm's location in a particular region during the Soviet era and the regional variation in local policies and institutions that induces variation in the effective price of privatizing urban land for all firms in a region.==== To construct such instruments, we draw on the intuition provided by Rodrik, 2013, Rodrik, 2014) that a given jurisdiction's effective price of land privatization reflects both prevailing ideologies and the material interests of political actors. During the transition period, regions inherited different endowments of “ideas” and “interests” that influenced how the regional authorities managed the unanticipated shocks of the transition economy. We thus design our instrumental variable strategy to capture the impact of these region-level influences. To isolate the regional variation in the effective price of privatizing land from other regional differences that may correlate with both land tenure status and land rental market activity, we employ a battery of regional controls. Conditional on these controls, we argue that, in the Russian context, the instruments are plausibly excludable. Finding consistent effects across the OLS and IV estimates would increase our confidence that our results are not explained by a spurious relationship between land tenure status and land market activity. Our IV estimates continue to show that firms that own their plots are more likely to dispose of their land through rental arrangements than firms that do not own their primary production plots.====The connection between land reallocation and private tenure rights could reflect demand and/or supply side factors. On the demand side, perhaps a “tragedy of the anticommons” slows the reallocation of publicly-owned urban real estate (Heller, 1998). The potential for having to deal with multiple overlapping claimants on non-private parcels may dispose lessees to transact with a single firm owner. Private ownership of land, in other words, by reducing a potential lessee's transaction costs increases their demand for rental plots. On the supply side, one can imagine at least two mechanisms at work. For one, if leasing out requires an up-front investment (e.g., prepping the land, identifying a suitable tenant, and concluding a rental agreement), then private tenure rights may provide assurance that subsequent rental income is less likely to be threatened by capricious or corrupt officials. Similarly, if leasing alerts predatory officials to a plot's under-utilization and value, then the threat of its expropriation may be less if the lessor holds private title.==== In both scenarios, private tenure would increase the supply of land to the rental market by increasing the security of the owner's claim over future rents.==== Below, after establishing a robust relationship between land tenure and reallocation through the rental market, we exploit the likely difference in value between plots located more and less centrally within an urban setting to provide evidence suggesting that this supply channel likely plays the more important role.====Our findings contribute to the literatures on urban economics as well as transition and development economics. A dominant theme in urban economics is the efficiency benefits of restricting private tenure rights in the context of a decentralized economy (Dunkerley and Whitehead, 1983). The experience of socialist cities, however, presents a stark example of the efficiency costs of suppressing decentralized markets (Bertaud and Renaud, 1997). Most of the evidence on the benefits of land markets for developing and transition countries derives from research on the agricultural sector or the urbanization of rural land (Kimura et al., 2011, Deininger and Jin, 2008). We are not aware of an empirical paper that rigorously investigates how property rights to land impact urban firms’ land allocation decisions. In terms of urban land policy in developing countries, common themes are access to housing and particularly the problem of squatting and rapid urbanization (Malpezzi, 1999, Fernandes and Varley, 1998) but not access to land for firms. An emerging literature has begun to evaluate the efficiency of non-market land allocation by government. Lichtenberg and Ding (2009) find that state officials respond to market incentives in China in allocating land for urban use. However, Wang (2011) provides evidence of inefficiencies in the state-allocation of housing in China. We contribute to these separate strands of literature by taking the level of misallocation inherited from the Soviet past as a given, and answering whether land titles lead to reallocation.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides relevant details of the Russian context, highlighting how the combination of the country's recent property rights reforms and its socialist inheritance of spatial misallocation offers a unique setting in which to explore the relationship between tenure rights and land reallocation. Section 3 introduces the survey of large urban industrial firms. In Section 4, we explore the relationship between tenure rights and leasing activity. Section 5 expands on this initial exploration by introducing an instrumental variable estimator to address the potential endogeneity of land tenure. Section 6 uses additional survey evidence to consider the mechanism underlying the relationship between land tenure and rental markets. Section 7 concludes.","Land rights, rental markets and the post-socialist cityscape",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596719300848,10 September 2019,2019,Research Article,210.0

This paper studies the power-publication link by applying an event-study strategy to a panel dataset of the publication and biographical information of deans of economics schools in Chinese universities. We find that (i) deanship increases an individual's publication by 0.7 articles per year; (ii) the increased publications stem from work coauthored with other researchers within the same university; (iii) the topics of the increased publications are more likely to deviate from the deans’ research area prior to becoming deans; and (iv) the power effect is smaller for top universities and leading journals, and for scholars with more pre-dean publications. These patterns appear consistent with the role of power in resource allocation rather than the impact of ability or reputation of the deans and thus have implications on distortions in knowledge production.","Although the importance of power is well documented in politics, economics, and psychology (e.g., Adams et al., 2005, Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006, Schilke et al., 2015), researchers have paid less attention to its impact in academia, perhaps believing that in this context, resource allocation should be driven primarily by academic merit. In power-oriented societies, however, academia may not be immune to the influence of power. In this paper, we investigate the link between power and publications in Chinese academia and attempt to understand why power matters. By documenting how administrative power affects the quantity and topics of an individual's publications, our study provides evidence on rent seeking in knowledge production. By offering a political economy perspective, it also contributes to a growing literature on the determinants of scientific output (e.g., Aghion et al., 2010, Borjas and Doran, 2015a and Borjas and Doran, 2015b, Iaria et al., 2018).====Our focus is the power-publication link in Chinese universities. This setting is relevant and useful for at least three reasons. First, China has become the world's second-largest producer of research articles behind only the United States. Meanwhile, it faces serious difficulties in improving research quality and efficiency, often attributable to its top-down administrative system (Xie et al., 2014) and factors other than research ability such as connections (Fisman et al., 2018). Second, realizing the importance of scientific output for economic growth, the Chinese government has prioritized higher education since the 1990s and has invested around one trillion US dollars in higher education each year in the recent decade (China Educational Finance Statistical Yearbook 2017). Scholars have argued that the allocation of a large part of these resources has been highly distorted by administrative power. For instance, two leading scientists, Yigong Shi and Yi Rao, pointed out in ====, that “to obtain major grants in China, it is an open secret that doing good research is not as important as schmoozing with powerful bureaucrats and their favorite experts” (Shi and Rao, 2010). Third, because the administrative system in Chinese universities is part of the country's top-down bureaucratic system, we can have a clear definition of “power”. Specifically, we can study the dean of the schools, whose power comes from administrative hierarchy rather than academic performance (as we will show).====To provide systematic evidence on the power-publication dynamics, we narrow our focus to the field of economics and construct a unique 1990–2009 dataset of the publication and biographical information of the heads (hereafter, “deans”) of major research schools, departments, and institutions of economics. We focus on publications on Chinese journals (whose turnaround time is typically shorter than one year). Thus, by examining the publication records of these deans before and after their appointment, we can quantitatively measure power's impact on their scholarly publications. We attempt to use a specific field to illustrate the influence of administrative power in Chinese academia, which is widely discussed yet under-researched, particularly in the social sciences.====One major empirical challenge in such an analysis is the possibility of an individual being promoted to dean because of previous productivity. To address this challenge, we use a within-individual event-study strategy that isolates the effect of individual characteristics that do not change quickly over time.==== Specifically, we include both year and individual fixed effects in our analysis – individual fixed effects control for the factors that do not change or change slowly over time such as personal ability, whereas yearly fixed effects control for the factors that affect all individuals similarly over time such as improvement of research capacity of Chinese universities. In later analysis, we also allow the effect of deanship to vary by the pre-dean publications and hence further control for the influence of ability.====We present four main empirical findings. First, while we find no increasing trend in publications before appointment to dean, we observe a notable and positive change in publications post appointment. In contrast, the publications for the whole school is not affected by the turnover of deans. Second, we find not only that improved publications come from an increase in coauthored publications rather than single-authored publications but that this increase is restricted to collaboration with researchers within the same institution. No similar change is observable for collaboration with researchers outside the dean's university. Third, we find that the topics of the increased publications are more likely to deviate from the dean's research area prior to becoming a dean. Finally, we demonstrate that the power effect is smaller for those working in top universities, for publishing on leading journals, and for scholars with higher pre-dean publications, suggesting that the power effect in Chinese academia does not result from individual ability and power can be constrained by other factors.====To see the implications of our findings on distortion, we discuss three interpretations of the positive power-publication link. The first, “the ability effect”, assumes that those with an increasing productivity trend are more likely to be selected for promotion to dean. They get more publications thanks to their ability. The second, “the reputation effect”, refers to the possible influence of dean's reputation that may facilitate publication. Other scholars may believe that including them as authors will increase their chances of publication.  Finally, “the resource effect”, assumes that power affects resource allocation. Local scholars feel pressured or actively seek to assign authorship to them because such coauthorship is closely related to resource allocation. If the increased publications were mainly driven by the dean's ability and reputation, our findings do not necessarily suggest distortion because local scholars’ resources and effort are not necessarily affected. However, various pieces of evidence together suggest these two channels are unlikely to explain our findings. Instead, the resource effect appears most consistent with the data patterns. This implies that resources available to scholars depend on their relationship with the dean. Moreover, since scholars face a choice of spending their time doing research and cultivating a good relationship with the dean, our findings also imply that scholars’ effort decision can be distorted.====Our study adds to a growing literature on the determinants of scientific production and academic performance. An earlier line of research have emphasized the role of age and gender (e.g., Cole, 1979, Cole and Zuckerman, 1984, Levin and Stephan, 1991, Oster and Hamermesh, 1998; Xie and Shauman, 1998; Ceci and Williams, 2011). More recently, scholars have expanded our understanding on the role of connections ((Laband and Piette, 1994), spillovers (Borjas and Doran, 2015a, Borjas et al., 2018), international scientific cooperation (Iaria et al., 2018), face-to-face communication (de Leon and McQuillin, 2018) and scientific prizes (Borjas and Doran, 2015b). Our study provides a political economy perspective to the literature on academic performance by documenting the role of administrative power.====Broadly speaking, our study also contributes to an increasing literature on human capital and physical capital misallocation (Murphy et al., 1991, Hsieh and Klenow, 2009, Midrigan and Xu, 2014). Previous studies have revealed misallocation of resources across different industrial sectors. In an efficient capital market, capital should be allocated to producers with higher productivity. Analogically, in an efficiency-orientated academia, resources should be allocated to scholars who can produce more research outputs. In a power-oriented society, however, it is conjectured that researchers with close connections with powerful people, rather than those with high productivity, would obtain resources (e.g., Shi and Rao, 2010). In our context, we find that gaining power increases publications more for those with lower pre-dean productivity, suggesting that the resource effect matters more for those with lower productivity.====Because the administrative system in Chinese universities belongs to the country's bureaucratic system, the administrative power of the dean may be particularly influential in our context. However, the patterns we uncover can be generalized to less extreme cases where universities are less autonomous and more influenced by the state. For instance, based on surveys of faculties in universities in Japan and Hong Kong, scholars find that hierarchical power relations often override intellectual contribution in multiple authorship (Macfarlane and Saitoh, 2009; Macfarlane, 2017). Even in Europe and the U.S., there is variation in the influence of administrative power that matters for research output (Aghion et al., 2010). Thus, while our study focuses on a specific field in China, our findings speak to a general issue in academia, especially in the context where administrative power influences resource allocation.",Power and publications in Chinese academia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759671930085X,5 September 2019,2019,Research Article,211.0

In their seminal contribution to African economic history, Acemoglu et al. (2002) show that pre-industrial population density is negatively correlated with modern-day income per capita. The result holds even when they include only African countries in their study sample.====The cause of this negative correlation, they argue, is the institutions established by Europeans in the colonies. Fewer Europeans settled in densely populated regions, and instead of introducing ‘good’ institutions (such as private property rights), these colonial powers imposed ‘bad’, extractive institutions. They say it was the poor institutional environment, rather than the geography, that made these countries poorer today than countries where ‘good’ institutions were set up. They note that the ‘reversal in relative incomes’ occurred mostly during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and they argue that it ‘resulted from societies with good institutions taking advantage of the opportunity to industrialise’ (Acemoglu et al., 2002, 1231).====Not everyone accepts the validity of this hypothesis. More recently, Maloney and Caicedo (2016) have used sub-national pre-colonial population densities for eighteen countries in the Western hemisphere to show that population density has persisted up to today: those countries with highest concentrations in 1500 remain most densely populated. Importantly, those countries also have higher average income levels today, challenging Acemoglu et al.’s hypothesis and suggesting wealth persistence instead.====We compare the merit of these two conflicting arguments by considering the case of South Africa over the past two hundred years. Our results show, firstly, that the settlement of black South Africans has been highly persistent: those areas that were populated primarily by this group in the 1830s and 1911 remain densely populated by their descendants today. At first, this appears to lend support to the argument of Maloney and Caicedo (2016): locational advantage determines persistence. But we argue that this is a simplistic interpretation of historical processes. The settlement patterns we observe in the 1830s are related to specific historical events, particularly conflicts within the Bantu-speaking peoples and the movement of European settlers into the interior of the country. As new archaeological evidence now shows, indigenous settlement patterns were very different only one century earlier. Although we find population persistence in the two centuries before 2011 (the date of the most recent South African census), it is unlikely that settlement patterns at the beginning of the nineteenth century reflected a stable, Malthusian equilibrium. Path dependence may be a better explanation for the observed trends than persistence.====When we consider measures of welfare, we find that the regions that were most densely populated early in the nineteenth century have today the highest unemployment rates and the lowest night lights luminosity. If we assume that high population density in the nineteenth century reflects relative wealth – as it would have, given the devastating effects of the pre-colonial wars that characterized the era – this seems to suggest that a reversal of fortunes occurred, of the kind that would support Acemoglu et al. argument. But it is, again, not that simple. South Africa did not experience an institutional reversal: rather, black South Africans were subjected to extractive institutions in both ‘white South Africa’ and what would become the homelands, the semi-autonomous polities that were formed around historically densely settled areas. The extractive institutions in these homelands were the result of a mixture of precolonial institutions and apartheid-era government influences. Democracy brought new institutional arrangements: black South Africans could now own property and vote in ‘white South Africa’, but were still subject to extractive institutions in the former homelands. The result was diverging economic outcomes for black South Africans, mitigated only by open borders and large out-migration.====Our paper expands the debate in three ways. First, past population density is often assumed to be correlated with income. At least during the pre-colonial era, when populations tended to rise with and offset any increases in wealth, this Malthusian argument appeared to be valid. We question this assumption in the case of South Africa. In particular, we argue that the slave trade and internal warfare may have obliged people to settle (even before colonial displacement) in areas that were not optimal for wealth accumulation following industrialisation – such as areas that were rugged or far from markets. Second, both Acemoglu et al. (2002) and Maloney and Caicedo (2016) include descendants of European settlers in their current-day estimates of population density and income. Their estimates are therefore confounded by other causal mechanisms (in addition to geography and institutions), such as cultural and genetic diversity. Our focus is only on the descendants of the indigenous, Bantu-speaking inhabitants of South Africa. The mechanism that explains the persistence or reversal of population density and wealth must be either geography or institutions. Third, we argue that the mechanism that Acemoglu et al. (2002) found to explain reversal of fortune, i.e. a change in institutions, does not explain the South African case. Black South Africans were generally excluded from economic and political rights in both ‘white South Africa’ and the former homelands. It was only towards the end of apartheid, and emphatically so after 1994, that these rights began to be shared more equally and the welfare of black South Africans in the former ‘white areas’ began to improve. The same was not true in the former homelands, where the positions of chiefs and headmen became more entrenched, deepening the institutional divide. Migration from the former homelands to the cities has become the primary poverty alleviation strategy for black South Africans in the twenty-five years after the end of apartheid.====In short, our paper questions the premises of the persistence versus reversal debate. Black South Africans incomes have diverged enormously, not because of an institutional reversal, but because of idiosyncratic historical shocks that affected the timing and intensity of settler migration, the type of extractive institutions that were set up in both ‘white South Africa’ and the homelands and the inability to move between these, and the institutional divergence after the start of democracy. As the case of South Africa shows, history is too complicated to be compressed into binary outcomes at the bookends of historical eras.",The great divergence in South Africa: Population and wealth dynamics over two centuries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718302002,27 August 2019,2019,Research Article,212.0

A few months after the plan’s initial implementation in August 1958, food shortages were reported; by the spring of 1961, more than 30 million citizens had died of starvation and famine-related illnesses. However, as the national plan was rolled out and then upheld over three years, on-the-ground implementation was nonuniform. Using georeferenced terrain ruggedness data which captures small-scale topological irregularities and information on provincial leadership attitudes towards Mao’s plan, I provide evidence on forces underlying the famine’s intensity and distribution. The analysis is based on a differential effect, in which a fear-based incentive structure characterizing the plan’s implementation is implicitly embedded. The baseline results indicate that rugged terrain protected more than 4.6 million rural Chinese from dying in the famine. By identifying an additional benefit of ruggedness to health and well-being in some rural communities, I show that not only does a causal relationship exist at a local level between Great Leap policies and famine mortality, but also that the lethality of the policies varied per state power at the time.","Does greater state capacity always benefit citizens? Recently, this question been up for debate in the fields of economic history and economic development (Besley, Persson, 2013, Johnson, Koyama, 2017). Drawing on a significant event in mid-20th-century Chinese history, I provide evidence that, when a government pursues rash polices, high state capacity can help bring about destructive consequences.====To provide a brief overview of the situation of concern, in 1958, Mao Zedong was the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and enacted his development agenda for the next five years (1958–1962) called the Great Leap Forward (GLF). The plan’s objective was to rapidly accelerate China’s industrialization and with the goal of overtaking British industry output within 15 years or less. A foundation of the scheme was the drastic reorganization of China’s rural labor force which made up the vast majority of the country in order to optimize labor hours and output. However, in 1961, the GLF was abandoned after more than 30 million citizens, primarily in rural areas, had died of starvation and related health complications (Ashton, 1984, Bernstein, 2006, Cao, 2005, Peng, 1987).====This tragic period is known as the Great Chinese Famine. Already, researchers have established that specific agricultural policies initiated by the GLF created some of the famine conditions (Bernstein, 1984, Chang, Wen, 1997, Chang, Wen, 1998, Fan, Xiong, Zhou, 2016, Houser, Sands, Xiao, 2009, Jones, Poleman, 1962, Kung, Lin, 2003, Li, Yang, 2005, Lin, 1990, Lin, Yang, 2000, Liu, 2010b, Liu, 2010a, Liu, Wen, Wei, 2014, Meng, Qian, Yared, 2015, Yang, 1996, Yang, 2008). Additionally, political incentives facing top bureaucrats at the time have been shown to have driven the radical implementation of the GLF policies (Kung, Chen, 2011, Yang, Su, 1998, Yang, Xu, Tao, 2014).====I propose that, like their higher-level political counterparts, an incentive structure also affected local leaders’ decisions to implement GLF policies. Case in point, within the Cao and Yang (2015) assessment of the famine in Wuwei County of Anhui Province (one of the areas that suffered the greatest mortality rates), the authors explain that local cadres “... were motivated by sheer terror, as they were forced to adhere to campaign (GLF) rhetoric in order to preserve their own political lives [pp. 1689]... those (cadres) who had shown reservations or hesitation (regarding GLF policy implementation) were sent to labour camps, where they were tortured [pp. 1697].”====Simply put, local leaders implemented GLF policies at the peril of their constituents to save themselves. However, the intensity with which a local leader implemented the GLF policies varied along two observable dimensions, the political leanings of their direct provincial superiors and the ease with which the local’s leader implementation choice could be evaluated. I proxy for these characteristics at the local level with (1) provincial adventurism in 1959 and (2) terrain ruggedness. I find that the interaction of the two proxy variables predicts famine mortality (1959-61), such that higher famine mortality existed where a local leader experienced more political pressure from his superiors and was more likely to be evaluated.====I detect a differential effect of terrain ruggedness on famine severity that arises from two competing relations. First, generally, ruggedness is positively correlated with famine through underdevelopment, ruggedness  →  underdevelopment  →  famine. Second, in the case of China between 1959 and 1961, the GLF effectuates another relationship between ruggedness and famine because a number of important aspects of the GLF plan were likely sensitive to topographic hurdles. These policies could include grain procurement, anti-concealment campaigns, agricultural collective size, mobilization of peasants as laborers for non-agricultural projects, and restriction of exit rights from the collectives, among others. Therefore, in some areas ruggedness limited the Great Leap and the related famine, ruggedness  →  Great Leap  →  survival. A principle objective of this research is to examine the relative strength of these effects.====My methodology is based on Nunn and Puga (2012)’s demonstration of how terrain ruggedness limited the reach of slave raiders in Africa. Application of this “rugged terrain as protection” hypothesis fits squarely into an Asian context. Scott (2009)’s seminal exploration of the possibility that people can benefit from residing outside the reach of the state under an extractive regime in set in Indochina and employs the Chinese dynastic state as one of its primary antagonist. A similar tension between the Chinese state center and the local administration on the periphery at work in my model has been highlighted during the Literary Inquisition (1660–1788) (Xue and Koyama, 2016).====There are specific examples of terrain’s impact influence on the GLF program. For one, Chen (2011) explains the contrast between the death rates in Jiangxi and Anhui through taxation during the GLF period.==== On one hand, in Jiangxi, a number of State Farms that had recently opened to developed wooded hills and mountains, marshes, and swampland. These new State Farms were exempt from paying tax for one to three years, and taxation directly affected the residual food supply for an area. Thus, people working on marginal land in Jiangxi had relatively greater food supply during the GLF. Anhui, on the other hand, had fewer new State Farms established.====To assess the magnitude of my primary estimated effects, I calculate famine mortality rates (1959-61) for a counterfactual China, that is, a China with absolutely no terrain variation. Then, I compare the mortality rates in the counterfactual state with the observed famine mortality (1959-61) relative to the political ideology of the provincial leadership at the start of the GLF period. I find that in the face of politically adventuristic provincial leadership and zero topographic hurdles, the excess death rate would have been 17 percent greater than what was actually observed.==== These results have economically meaningful implications. I estimate that rugged terrain saved 4.6 million lives from policy-driven famine conditions.====To further verify my estimates, I conduct a discontinuity analysis at the boundary of adventuristic and conservative provinces. Analyzing the differential effect of ruggedness on famine mortality close to this specified boundary reduces the likelihood of unobservable characteristics biasing my results. In this restricted analysis, the baseline results are maintained. The estimates suggest that even for communities geographically close to one another, but under ideologically different provincial leadership during the Great Leap Forward, ruggedness provided a differential benefit to the communities where the policies were likely more rigorously implemented.====My paper most directly contributes to the body of research seeking answers to the why and how the Chinese Famine took place. First, it provides more evidence that GLF policies were detrimental to the food entitlement in rural communities (Becker, 1996, Manning, Wemheuer, 2011, Riskin, 1998, Thaxton, 2008, Yang, 2012). Secondly, it reconfirms that politics played a substantial role in the distribution of famine mortality (1959-61).====Third, and more specifically, my results confirm the dynamic relationship between of political radicalism and topographic obstacles in Great Leap Forward implementation. With the following example, Garnaut (2014) underscores this relationship:====Finally, to the best of my knowledge, my research joins one country-wide study highlighting the institutional nature of localized famine in China (1959-61) using sub-provincial data. Meng et al. (2015) establish a surprisingly positive relationship between rural mortality and per capita food production at the county-level. The authors provide additional quantitative evidence that the Great Leap Forward’s grain procurement policy was necessary for generating the paradoxical pattern but only at the provincial level.==== In the end, my study brings countering evidence to the debate Bramall (2011) continued. Bramall uses descriptive evidence from Sichuan province to question the existence of a pattern to famine mortality during the Great Leap Forward and concludes that local leaders were a random driving force in the policy implementation.====The rest paper is organized as follows.

Much less is known about its long-run effect, as well as the impact on other aspects of human capital formation such as labor market and noncognitive outcomes. This paper studies the impact of trade liberalization on individuals’ long-term human capital accumulation, including school attendance, cognitive abilities, labor market performance, and noncognitive outcomes. By constructing prefecture-year-level tariff barriers, our identification strategy exploits variations in different cohorts’ exposure to a trade shock at age 16 for individuals within the same prefecture. Empirical results suggest that trade liberalization leads to decreased completed years of schooling, cognitive abilities, wage, and noncognitive outcomes. We provide suggestive evidence that this observed pattern is explained by the expansion of job opportunities in relatively low-skilled and labor-intensive sectors.","In the past several decades, export-led growth policies have been considered to be an effective way to achieve industrialization for developing economies. It is therefore crucial to better understand the consequences of opening to trade, and whether and how trade liberalization might influence human capital accumulation. The effects of trade liberalization on human capital have long been studied by economists, and most of these studies focus on the individual’s investment in education. The results are mixed: some studies find that increased exports lead to increased returns to skills (Schank, Schnabel, Wagner, 2007, Munch, Skaksen, 2008, Hanson, Harrison, 1999, Goldberg, Pavcnik, 2007), and thus motivate more youth to pursue higher education. Other studies find that in many developing countries, export sector expansion increases demand for low-skilled labor, and thus raises the opportunity cost of receiving higher education. In turn, this leads to higher dropout rates (Atkin, 2016, Li, 2018).====While much research has focused on the effect of trade liberalization on human capital formation, most of these studies examine the short-term effect on an individual’s school attendance at a young age. Several questions remain to be answered. For example, what is the long-term effect of trade liberalization on human capital formation? In addition to school attendance, what is the effect on other dimensions of cognitive outcomes? More importantly, in addition to education, what is the effect on an individual’s labor market performance and noncognitive measurements? Very little progress has been made in addressing these issues, largely because of a lack of longitudinal studies that trace exposure to tariff reduction on individual-level performance from a long-term perspective.====This study takes a novel step in that direction by linking exposure to exporting tariff reduction at a young age to the individual’s comprehensive performance after entering adulthood, on average, 14 years after exposure. Following the strategies exploited by Atkin (2016), our identification strategy exploits variation in different birth cohorts’ exposure to trade liberalization within the same district.==== Specifically, we first follow Topalova (2010) to construct prefecture-level tariffs by weighting industry tariffs with the prefecture’s employment share for each industry. As a consequence, the cross-prefecture variations in tariff levels originate from two sources: differences in industrial specialization by prefecture and tariff-level differences across industries. Then, we match the prefecture-year level tariff with the 2014 China Family Panel Survey (CFPS, 2014) dataset, which contains rich data on individual characteristics in 2014. To summarize, the identification strategy exploits variations in the prefecture-level industrial composition, which generates differential trade shocks across cities when the individual was 16 years old.====We find evidence that trade liberalization decreases long-term human capital accumulation. First, individuals exposed to a reduced district tariff at the key exposure age are more likely to drop out after middle school, and thus have fewer years of schooling. Second, trade liberalization reduces their cognitive abilities, measured by math and word test scores at the time of the survey (on average, 14 years after exposure). Third, while trade liberalization is found to have little effect on employment, it significantly reduces the worker’s wage in labor market. Fourth, it also reduces individuals’ noncognitive outcomes, including a lower level of general satisfaction, confidence and a higher level of mental stress.====How could the reduced tariff barriers that result from trade liberalization affect the level of human capital adjustments? One direct consequence of low tariffs is the expansion of employment in the export sector and other sectors connected by a production linkage. As Atkin (2016) points out, increased job opportunities would have two off-setting effects on schooling: the “opportunity cost channel” and the “returns to education channel.” The opportunity cost channel suggests that the reduced tariff may generate an increased number of job opportunities. As a consequence, a student may drop out of school to take a factory job because of the increased opportunity cost of schooling. The return to schooling channel suggests that a student may choose to pursue further schooling if he/she expects that there will be job vacancies in the future and that a higher level of education attainment will be rewarded. How trade liberalization affects human capital investment depends on which channel dominates.====We present multiple pieces of additional evidence to support the claim that the pattern we find is driven by the increased opportunity cost to schooling. We use the Industry Survey Dataset to show an expansion of employment for labor-intensive and low-skill jobs with the tariff reduction. Additionally, we provide evidence showing that education is one part of, but not the whole, channel that results in a reduced labor market and noncognitve performance.====This paper mainly builds on the growing literature that examines the effects of trade liberalization on human capital adjustment. Atkin (2016) focuses on a period of rapid trade liberalization in Mexico from 1986 to 2000, and finds that the expansion of export-sector job opportunities increases the high school drop-out rate during this period. Blanchard and Olney (2017) and Li (2018) use cross-country data and Chinese data, respectively, and find that export expansion in high-skilled/low-skilled sectors can encourage/discourage further educational attainment. Our study has two main features that differentiate it from these studies. First, while previous studies focus on education only, we extend the outcomes to various aspects of human capital formation, including education, cognitive ability, labor market performance, and noncognitive measures. Second, while most previous studies focus on the immediate or short-term effect, we extend the estimates from immediate impact to long-term impacts 14 years, on average, after exposure.====More broadly, our paper is also related to the literature that examines long-term impact of macroeconomic or other external shocks at a young age. For example, Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2014) find that people who grow up in recessions are more likely to hold more left-leaning political views that support government redistribution. Liu and Hannum (2017) find that early exposure to poverty impedes educational attainment and leads to worse health outcomes. Oreopoulos et al. (2012) study the impact of economic conditions at graduation from college on labor market outcomes, and identify negative and persistent wage effects if individuals graduated during a bad economy. Since many developing countries have experienced rapid trade liberalization and expansion of the manufacturing sector, whether and how trade shocks at a young age affect long-term human capital outcomes will carry profound policy implications.====The structure of the paper is as follows.

When elite members and citizens try to cooperate in sharing consumption risk and joint investment, the elite enacts democracy to convince the citizens that a sufficient part of the investment return will be shared via public spending and thus, they should cooperate. In addition, cultural accumulation rises with the severity of consumption risk at its moderate values and then drops at its high values making cheating too appealing. Finally, the citizens may over-accumulate culture to credibly commit to cooperating in investment at its intermediate values threatening democracy. These predictions are consistent with novel data on 90 European historical regions spanning the 1000–1600 period. Reforms towards tighter constraints on the elite’s power were driven by the potential for Mediterranean trades. Moreover, the activity of both the Cistercians and the Franciscans, our proxy for the citizens’ culture, has an inverted U-shaped link with the temperature volatility. Finally, the shift of long-distance trades towards the Atlantic fostered the Franciscans’ spread in the Mediterranean, where they organized micro-credit activities reinforcing the citizenry-elite partnerships.","Overwhelming evidence suggests that a “culture of cooperation,” which is the implicit reward from cooperating in any prisoner’s dilemma and investment types of activity, and “inclusive political institutions,” which enable the citizenry to better select public-spirited representatives and check their decisions, represent the most successful humanly devised social structures,==== and that they are related to a legacy of an inclusive political process (Putnam, Leonardi, Nanetti, 1993, Tabellini, 2010, Guiso, Sapienza, Zingales, 2016). Documenting, however, that the two institutions reinforce one another and are persistent does not help detect the forces producing each and identify their interaction. Inspired by a growing literature on the economic incentives behind the selection of each institution (North, Weingast, 1989, Fleck, Hanssen, 2006, Benati, Guerriero, Zaina), we lay out a model to tackle this issue, and test its implications by exploiting a novel dataset on the vast institutional revolution that shook Europe between 1000 and 1600. At the beginning of this period indeed, the lords began offering the peasants high powered farming contracts to exploit the improved land productivity. Moreover, they entered into commercial partnerships with a rising class of merchants engaged in reestablished long-distance trades. These innovations flourished where the lords relinquished some political power to gain credibility as investment partners, and they persisted where the citizenry credibly committed to cooperating in investment by attracting the Cistercians and the Franciscans. Uniquely within Western monasticism, both monastic orders dictated charity-based norms of cooperation in exchange for guidance on how to share consumption risk and accordingly, they were especially sought-after by communities facing a very—but not too—erratic climate. This intensified cooperation secured the citizenry-elite relationships delaying the comeback of autocracies and shaping Europe to date.====We envision a simple, and yet general, setup to elucidate the incentives behind these related institutional discontinuities and shed light on similar episodes. Formally, society is split in a minority of “elite” members and a majority of “citizens,” who can either share consumption risk with any other individual or invest with a member of a different group. The first activity resembles a prisoner’s dilemma interaction and gauges a more fundamental form of cooperation. The second, more profitable one, captures an advanced form of cooperation requiring group-specific inputs and producing a taxable return. First, each group costly instills into its members a psychological gain from cooperating. This implicit reward embodies a culture of cooperation, and, in equilibrium, is an evolutionarily stable strategy. Next, the elite selects the political regime. Democracy allows the citizenry to fix the share of investment value to be spent on the production of a public good and its type between two possibilities, each preferred and less costly to be produced by one of the two groups. Autocracy gives these two prerogatives to the elite. Then, the agents are randomly matched, and an elite member selects the activity if she is paired off with the citizen. Finally, taxation and public goods production follow a cooperative investment.====Since the heterogeneity in the preferences for the public goods and the inefficiencies in their production render investment infeasible under autocracy, the equilibrium displays two features. First, the prospect of a sufficiently profitable investment pushes the elite to enact democracy to convince the citizens that a sufficient part of its return will be shared via public spending and thus, they should cooperate. Second, accumulation of culture rises with the severity of consumption risk at its moderate values and then, drops at its high values making cheating too appealing. Furthermore, the citizens’ culture and democratization can either reinforce or undermine one another. When the investment-specific factor is dominant, the citizens’ culture encourages democracy and investment. When the risk-sharing-specific factor is dominant, it hinders democratization since it makes risk-sharing more appealing for the elite. When neither factor is dominant, the elite turns uncooperative to force the citizens to limit taxation in an effort to obtain democracy and investment. Yet, to credibly commit to cooperating, despite the limited public spending, the citizens need to accumulate a culture possibly higher than the full-cooperative level prevailing without credibility issues. Hence, culture becomes an enforcement mechanism for the elite and a commitment device for the citizens. In a dynamic version of the model, such “over-accumulation” of culture also reduces the elite’s temptation to repeal political reforms after a fall in the investment value.====We evaluate those model implications concerning the determinants and interaction of institutions by analyzing 90 historical regions, parts of 16 European countries, on which we have sufficient data for each half-century between 1000 and 1600. This sample offers substantial variation on economies sufficiently simple to allow us to credibly relate activity-specific factors to institutional evolution. Given that the main economic activities were farming and long-distance trades, we gauge consumption risk with the standard deviation of the growing season temperature over the previous half-century and the investment value with the direct access to the coast. Turning to institutions, we measure the inclusiveness of the political process with the constraints on the elite’s power score. We construct this index following the Polity IV project prescriptions and building on the events within a 40-year window around each half-century. We validate this variable by reporting its strong positive correlation with a proxy for the inclusiveness of present-day regional political institutions. We capture the citizens’ culture with the cumulated discounted number of years of activity of Cistercian and Franciscan houses per square km. We validate this proxy by documenting its strong positive links with an outcome-based measure of past culture and present-day norms of respect and trust. Different from Andersen et al. (2017), we cannot find any correlation between the Cistercians’ activity and norms of hard work and thrift. These differences in the estimates are driven by the mix of the higher precision and the panel structure of our data, and they are consistent with a recent historic literature challenging the idea that the Protestant ethic had a pre-Reformation origin in the Cistercian presence.====OLS estimates suggest that reforms towards more inclusive political institutions were driven by the potential for Mediterranean—but not Atlantic—trades, making our results similar to those in Greif (1992) but different from the Acemoglu et al. (2005) conclusions. In addition, the citizenry’s culture has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the temperature volatility. Finally, the shift of the long-distance trades towards the Atlantic fostered the Franciscans’ spread in the Mediterranean. Here, the Friars Minor organized micro-credit activities allowing the citizens to reinforce their partnerships with the nobility in cases of liquidity shocks. This large accumulation of culture helped sustain more inclusive political institutions despite the fading investment possibilities and induced the primacy of the Mediterranean over the Atlantic trades as institutional enablers.====Thanks to the accuracy and the independence from human decisions of the proxies for the risk-sharing- and the investment-specific geographic factors, we can exclude that our estimates are driven by either measurement error or reverse causation. Moreover, our focus on medieval Europe rules out that our results are spuriously produced by region-specific features of the European colonization, i.e., the colonizers’ strategy (Acemoglu et al., 2001) and the intensity of missionary activities and slavery (Nunn, 2010, Nunn, Wanchekon, 2011). We cannot, however, leave out the possibility that other unobservable factors are biasing our estimates. To evaluate this issue, we follow a three-step strategy. First, we control not only for historical region and half-century fixed effects as well as the average temperature, but also for other observables driving institutions in our sample, i.e., terrain ruggedness and lagged values of both the frequency of external wars and population density. Including these controls has little effect on our results. Second, we calculate how much greater the influence of unobservables would need to be, relative to all observables, to explain away the links between geography and institutions. We find that it would have to be on average almost 10 times greater than the influence of all observables. This seems to be unlikely. Finally, we perform a falsification test to examine the link between the volatility of the medieval growing season temperature and present-day norms of respect and trust inside and outside the sample. Within the sample, we find a strong positive link between the two variables, as expected given our OLS estimates and the persistence of a culture of cooperation. If medieval temperature volatility shaped past culture only through risk-sharing needs, we should not find a similar relationship where cultural accumulation costs were prohibitive because of the opposition to both monastic orders. This is what we find. Focusing on 56 NUTS 3 Turkish regions, we estimate an insignificant link between medieval temperature volatility and present-day norms of respect and trust. This is consistent with the barriers to the two monastic orders’ entry erected first by the Eastern Orthodox Church and then, by the Ottoman empire. Overall, these robustness checks make difficult to envision that our estimates are driven by mechanisms different from those we model. Hence, we take them as consistent with, if not proving, causality running from geography to institutions.====The papers most closely related to ours are four. First, Fleck and Hanssen (2006) prompt that the elite introduces democracy to convince the citizens that the returns on a joint investment, which is difficult-to-observe because of, for instance, the hilly landscape, will not be expropriated. Second, Bentzen et al. (2016) symmetrically document that democratization fails when the elite can easily elicit the citizens’ cooperation in investment through the direct control of natural and, in particular, water resources. Finally, Durante (2010) and Litina (2016) show that climate risk between 1500 and 1750 and unfavorable land endowments strengthened cooperation in present-day Europe and a cross-section of 132 countries, respectively. Yet, none of these articles characterizes theoretically and empirically the determinants of and the interaction between a culture of cooperation and inclusive political institutions.==== Accordingly, our paper offers three key contributions. First, we develop a theory of endogenous (in)formal institutions based on the mix of the heterogeneity in economic resources and preferences for the public goods and the inefficiencies in their production clarifying that, over and above violence (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000) and political power (Acemoglu et al., 2005), the citizens rely on culture to elicit democratization. This mechanism cannot be produced by the extant literature, which foresees full expropriation by the ruler and zeroes each agent’s outside option. Moreover, our framework can be used to analyze other cases in which cooperation between groups with different political power was crucial, e.g., Industrial Revolution (Lizzeri and Persico, 2004). Second, we evaluate those model implications concerning the determinants and interaction of institutions. In doing so, we devise a novel dataset, which displays sizable variation across time and space, and, in particular, a time-dependent measure of past culture, which has been shown valid in other contexts (Padró i Miquel et al., 2017). Finally, while testing our theory, we suggest a multiple instrumental variables approach to unbundle institutions (Guerriero, 2019).====The paper proceeds as follows. We review, in Section 2, the stylized facts about the medieval institutional revolution to motivate the general model that we analyze in Section 3. Next, we state the model predictions in Section 4, and we discuss their test in Section 5. Finally, we conclude in Section 6, and we report proofs, figures, and tables in the appendix.",Endogenous (in)formal institutions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718302154,30 July 2019,2019,Research Article,215.0

The standard errors of these indexes stem from the degree of variation across the sources upon which these two aggregate indices are based. In general, standard errors are not associated with country characteristics; this supports the common assumption that differences across surveys are random. There are two exceptions, however. They involve the degree of media freedom in a country and the country's past corruption scores, possibly indicating the use of cognitive heuristics by the assessors who do the ratings. No evidence exists that more diverse countries have greater variation across corruption scores. In comparing the two aggregate measures, we find that the standard errors for TI-CPI are associated with country characteristics in fewer cases than are those for WGI-CC. Finally, our findings raise concerns about the applicability of the WGI-CC's use of the unobserved components model for extracting signals from noise.","Two of the most widely used measures of corruption (or, inversely, of the control of corruption) are the Worldwide Governance Indicators’ Control of Corruption (WGI-CC) and Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (TI-CPI).==== Researchers have used them numerous times to assess the causes and effects of corruption. The indices also have far-reaching influence beyond academia. Governments use them to evaluate anticorruption efforts. International agencies use them to distribute foreign aid, and global investors use them to allocate capital (Mauro, 1995, Egger and Winner, 2006, Treisman, 2007, Kaufmann et al., 2011). The significance of these indices would be difficult to overstate.====Given their frequent usage, determining the reliability of these indices as well as better understanding the sources of measurement errors are of paramount importance. One could examine the first issue (reliability) if one held great confidence that some index or proxy accurately measured true levels of corruption in a country. Comparing other indices with the true measure would then indicate how well indices like the WGI-CC and the TI-CPI perform. See Svensson, 2005, Mocan, 2009, Olken, 2009, Razafindrakoto and Roubaud, 2010, and Donchev and Ujhelyi (2014) among others. For example, Donchev and Ujhelyi (2014) regress corruption perception measures such as the WGI-CC and the TI-CPI against measures of corruption experiences generated from household or firm level surveys. If these perception measures are informative and unbiased, then they should be strongly associated with corruption experiences but not with any of the controls also included in the regression model. Donchev and Ujhelvi (2014) instead find that corruption perception measures are not robustly associated with measures of corruption experiences but are associated with income levels, whether the country is democratic, and whether the country is Protestant. Of course, their approach presumes that averages of corruption experiences reliably measure true levels of corruption and so can be used as a measuring stick to compare alternative indices. In this paper, we do not take a stand on their approach and so do not attempt to compare the WGI-CC or TI-CPI indices to any other proxy that we presume to be more reliable. We are not examining whether these two measures reliably capture the true level of corruption within a country.====Instead, our examination concentrates on the standard error of the indices to better understand the sources of variation in corruption ratings. The WGI and TI both assign a single corruption score, namely a point estimate, to each country and report the corresponding standard error of each point estimate. The point estimate stems from an average (which could be a weighted or unweighted average) of corruption scores from the different sources used to create the index. The standard error indicates the magnitude of variation in reported levels of corruption across these data sources used to construct the indices (although the WGI standard error is determined in further steps as described below). The developers of the indices presume that these standard errors arise from measurement errors originating from the raw surveys of corruption and/or the data aggregation process (Kaufmann and Kraay, 2008, Kaufmann et al., 2007, Kaufmann et al., 2009, Kaufmann et al., 2011).==== We consider the potential for the magnitudes of these standard errors to be associated with various underlying factors as opposed to being random noise. To what extent is the variation in corruption perceptions across sources associated with measurable factors?====Please note that we do NOT argue that a small standard error implies that a measure is close to its true, unobserved level of corruption. For example, a majority of survey respondents could have overestimated the level of corruption in a country due to similar false assumptions or missing information.==== The uniformity of responses would then lead to a small standard error despite inaccurately assessing the true level of corruption. Thus, a smaller standard error merely indicates less variation in the perceived level of corruption across surveys and not that a measure is closer to its true value or has less bias. Therefore, this paper does not consider why corruption (or measured corruption) is greater in some countries as opposed to others nor do we examine how corruption indices are developed, including the commensurate advantages. Instead, by examining the standard errors we want to better understand why differing levels of variation arise as to the prevalence of corruption in a country.====We find several reasons why examining variation in general (and standard errors more specifically) can provide important insights. For one, such an analysis can determine to what extent variation in responses is associated with measurable attributes and so is not random. What country-level characteristics predict where disagreement – i.e. variation – regarding the prevalence of corruption is greatest? For what types of countries are assessments more uniform? Such information could influence how we weight a new measurement of corruption from a single source. For example, results below suggest that variation is lower in countries with more media freedom. Suppose that a new survey provides a measurement of corruption for a country where media freedom is prevalent. Then one can be more confident (ceteris paribus) that additional surveys would give similar measurements. On the other hand, for a country with less media freedom one would be less certain that later surveys would provide similar measurements. Again, this does not mean that the measurement of corruption in a country with more media freedom is closer to the true level of corruption but does indicate that measurements from other sources are less likely to change perspective. International organizations that monitor corruption in a country could use this information to determine how much weight to place on the information that this single source provides.====Second, examining the standard errors can still point to concerns regarding how those assessing corruption evaluate countries. For example, the extent that the degree of variation depends on how past scores were reported raises concerns that survey respondents are allowing past scores to unduly influence current assessments. Past scores could then be causing greater uniformity as they anchor subsequent assessments, implying undue dependences in corruption ratings.====Another insight is to better understand why different sources report differing levels of corruption. Is there one true level of corruption in a country that is measured with error across respondents or do distinct types of respondents experience different levels of corruption and surveys do not equally sample across these types within the population? These surveys accurately capture the level of corruption experienced by their respective samples but their samples are not all representative of the general population. Considering a variety of institutions conducting corruption surveys with different purposes and resources, we presume this second possibility to be more likely in countries with more diverse populations. Therefore, to the extent that variation in measurements across sources are greater for more diverse countries then our results would indicate that variation across sources could stem from the differing levels of corruption that different groups face. However, we do not find associations between measures of diversity and the standard errors, providing less support that differences across surveys stem from disproportionate samples of groups facing differing levels of corruption.====Our results also hold implications for empirical work. Consider a methodology where corruption is the dependent variable and is regressed on a set of possible determinants. The distribution of the error term in this regression is influenced by the distribution of corruption scores. To the extent that the variation in scores depends on various underlying characteristics, then the error term is likely to be heteroskedastic. Understanding the nature of this heteroskedasticity and what is associated with the variance of the error term can aid in estimation.====Finally, results from this exercise hold implications for the applicability of the Unobserved Components Model (UCM), which is used to construct the WGI-CC, a commonly used measure of corruption. A strength of the UCM methodology is that it more heavily weights sources that exhibit less noise. However, a crucial assumption of the UCM approach is that the error within each source between the true level of corruption and the reported value is uncorrelated across sources. The extent that lower standard errors are not driven by greater precision but by common biases among sources then undercuts this premise. Another assumption of the UCM methodology is that the measurement error ==== has the same variance across respondents. Although we do not examine the standard error within a source, a finding that standard errors across sources could be associated with underlying factors could lead to greater concern that such measurement error arises within a source as well.====In many cases, we do not find robust, strong associations between the country characteristics considered below and the standard errors. Nevertheless, a couple of exceptions arise. First, standard errors appear to be driven by the availability to respondents of certain types of information regarding the country and of the country's previous scores. They also appear to be associated with the degree of media freedom. Although we do not attempt to investigate psychological factors behind rating behaviors, our results are consistent with views regarding how people make use of heuristics (that is, mental shortcuts) when faced with incomplete information or complex decisions. Further discussion on this point is provided below.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the importance of the standard errors in understanding the corruption indices. Section 3 presents the empirical methodology. Section 4 presents results and discusses implications. Section 5 applies the findings of Section 4 to assess the effectiveness of the UCM in obtaining more reliable indices.

We develop new time series of economic news tonality using a unique dataset of policy influenced articles published in major UK newspapers. We show that the volume and tonality of news respond to current economic conditions. For example, the nature of news changes around events of economic uncertainty such as the global financial crisis and the post-EU referendum periods. We also provide illustrative evidence that communication differs across newspaper formats. Tabloids, as opposed to quality newspapers, tend to express news more negatively, and mostly report policy-related news during periods of economic stress. The integral importance of these results is illustrated by news reaction curves showing a strong positive relationship mostly lasting three months between consumer sentiments and news.","The information set from which agents form expectations regarding future economic conditions is influenced by media outlets, especially TV broadcasts and newspapers (Blinder and Krueger, 2004). These forms of communication report experts’ forecasts and political perspectives at particularly low cost. In the United Kingdom (UK), newspapers are a significant supplier of economic news. However, the manner in which economic news is reported and consumed can differ significantly in terms of the frequency and format of news (for example, tabloids versus quality newspapers), the political affiliation of the publication, and the socioeconomic and demographic status of its readership. Economic news may therefore be communicated heterogeneously across newspapers, impacting agents in different ways depending on their news source.====Communication of economic news can take various forms. Firstly, newspapers can report on the stance of business cycles; communicating latest numbers on macroeconomic indicators such as economic growth, inflation, wages and unemployment. Secondly, they may report on future economic prospects provided by experts and surveys. Finally, they may also report on economic policies by the central bank or the government. One of the issues when interpreting data in each case is the potential for newspapers to report information in a biased way. In Hamilton (2004), news is a commodity to be consumed rather than a mirror of reality, which makes it in the interest of media companies to produce sellable news. The driving theory is that some news may be portrayed in a manner which appeals to a certain readership, and thus maximize profits on behalf of media companies (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010, Mullainathan and Shleifer, 2005). Moreover, the manner in which economic news is reported within tabloid and broadsheet publications must be considered. For example, Boykoff (2008) identifies differences in the manner with which climate change is communicated, dependent on the tabloid or broadsheet format of the news source.====The role of mass media in the formation of important events has benefited from long-dated attention in political, economic and finance literature. History bears witness to the impact of media coverage on future outcomes, such as political elections (DellaVigna and Kaplan, 2007, Hetherington, 1996). At the macroeconomic level, the impact of media has been addressed using Bayesian learning models (Lamla and Lein, 2014, Lamla and Maag, 2012). Lamla and Lein (2014) find that the intensity of news reporting helps consumers update their expectations on inflation. More news about inflation leads to higher inflation expectations, which are subsequently self-fulfilling. Lamla and Maag (2012) find that dispersion in the tone of economic news leads to higher volatility in inflation expectations, while Doms and Morin (2004) find that economic news correlates with patterns of fluctuating consumer spending.====The influence of newspapers and their reporting has already been measured in US data, where a measure to capture media influence (intensity, tone, or a combination of both) is used. Unlike qualitative techniques, measures such as ‘intensity’ and ‘tone’ allow for quantitative representation of words and articles which is useful in the construction of time series data. ‘Intensity’ relates to the frequency of certain keywords appearing in newspapers over a given time frame, while ‘tone’ attempts to measure the emotional content (sentiment) expressed within text. As an example, a measure of tone can simply be the number of positive words versus number of negative words in a text. Both intensity and tone measures are then used in different regression settings as predictor variables.====This paper seeks to investigate heterogeneity in the communication of economic news sentiments amongst UK newspapers by firstly developing a time series of economic sentiments, inspired by policy-relevant economic news. The procedure is closely linked to the literature on the development of sentiment indices from media sources. For example, Baker et al. (2016) construct an index of economic uncertainty based on the number of times the word ‘uncertainty’ appears in well-read newspapers. Tobback et al. (2016) refine this model to address economic uncertainty through utilization of tone instead of intensity, by considering the application of popular sentiment analysis algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes. Related studies have been conducted in other academic fields, such as finance. For example, Tetlock (2007) finds evidence of message board postings influencing stock market movements while Brown et al. (2018) show the impact of Twitter activity on changes within betting markets.====In this paper, the heterogeneity hypothesis is tested for thirteen UK newspapers using measures of sentiment (tonality), volume (intensity), and consensus across articles. The articles considered in the study are about economic policy in the United Kingdom, and two sentiment analysis techniques – Naïve Bayes and Dictionary – are used to compute sentiment scores for each news article on a positive to negative scale. We find that news media sentiment becomes notably less positive during the global financial crisis; our newspaper sentiment measures decreased by 63.4% (Naïve Bayes) and 36.2% (Dictionary) from the baseline model during this period. Similarly, the post-EU Referendum period coincides with a fall of 79.9% (Naïve Bayes) and 5.8% (Dictionary) in newspaper sentiment indices. Dictionary indices also show substantial sentiment variation across newspapers during the Global Financial Crisis and post-EU Referendum, with higher standard deviations recorded during these time periods than the baseline model.====A higher frequency of economic news is also found during these two time periods, as is a greater degree of heterogeneity in newspaper consensus. More uncertainty (lower consensus) is found during the global financial crisis, but interestingly we find a higher degree of consensus in the post-EU Referendum period. However, our findings suggest a clear distinction between two publication formats during this period: quality newspapers tend to report news in a more balanced fashion which incorporates a range of opinions, whereas tabloids tend to take a consistently hard-line and polarized stance on the issue.====The paper is structured as follows: The following section explains the construction of the data set and the time series of the news sentiment indicators.

We develop a new comprehensive human capital measure based on the Jorgenson-Fraumeni (J-F) lifetime income framework, in addition to using the traditional education-based human capital measures. We find that the new J-F human capital measure reflects more closely the regional economic disparity than the education-based measures. We also conduct a Divisia ==== to investigate the contributions of different factors to the quantity and quality growth of human capital and to regional disparity. Our results show that the regional human capital gaps in China are enlarging in general. Education and urbanization contribute most to human capital growth, while population aging shows a strong negative effect. Our estimates create a new provincial level human capital panel dataset from 1985 to 2014, which is useful for empirical work and policy analysis.","Human capital has been recognized as an important factor underlying economic growth in China (for example, Li et al., 2017, Su and Liu, 2016).==== Studies show that human capital investments promote economic convergence (Mankiw et al., 1992) and contribute to a reduction in regional inequality in China (Fleisher et al., 2010). Therefore, regional human capital is a vital input to policy design for regional development. In this study, we investigate regional human capital distribution and dynamics in China. Our results have direct policy relevance and can aid empirical research.====China has experienced impressive economic growth over the past 40 years. However, the growth is accompanied by rising regional inequality (Wan, 2007, Fleisher et al., 2010, Lin et al., 2013). The ratio of per capita GDP of the richest province to that of the poorest one was 4.28 in 2016, peaked at 6.57 in 2002. To put this in perspective, in the US, the ratio between the richest state and the poorest state was 2.03 in 2016.==== Additionally, the Coefficient of Variation (CV) for inter-provincial per capita GDP was 45% in China for 2016, while it was 18% in the U.S. for the same year.====We investigate regional human capital distribution among four regions in China: The East, Northeast, Interior and West.==== These regions represent different levels of economic development. The East region is along the coastline and is the most developed. The West region is the least developed, while the Interior region is in between in terms of both location and stage of development. The Northeast region was the most developed region in past years but gradually fell behind. Therefore, the human capital distribution among these regions can provide useful information for studying regional inequality.====In China the GDP per worker shows a clear regional pattern as shown in Fig. 1. It is the highest in the East and lowest in the West. More specifically, in 2014, GDP per worker in the West was 52% of that of the East, and the ratio was as low as 39% in 2005. In the Northeast, its GDP per worker was the highest of all regions in 1985 but then dropped continually to about 63% of the East's in 2005. It appears that the regional pattern of GDP per worker relative to the East follows a U-shape, i.e., the regional gaps were relatively small during the early years of economic reform, then increased significantly, and then narrowed after 2005.====When studying human capital, a central issue is the method of measurement. The most commonly used human capital measures are education-based, such as average years of schooling, proportion of labor force with a certain level of education, and various enrollment rates (Barro and Lee, 2013). Education can only partially measure the human capital of an individual because it omits many other aspects, such as on-the-job learning, health, etc. Additionally, education-based measures generally fail to reflect the quality of schooling (Hendricks, 2002, Schoellman, 2012, Manuelli and Seshadri, 2014). Hanushek and Woessmann (2012) shows that quantitative measures of schooling do not adequately capture the effect of human capital on economic growth due to the vast differences in school quality across countries. Additionally, some recent studies, such as Hanushek and Woessmann (2012), use cognitive skills to measure human capital. This measure has substantially raised the explanatory power on economic growth. However, cognitive/non-cognitive measures do not capture all aspects of an individual's human capital, and the data are generally less available, especially in China.====In this study, we develop a new comprehensive human capital measure. Our new measure of human capital stock follows the Jorgenson-Fraumeni (J-F) lifetime income approach (Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1989, Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1992a, Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1992b), which is widely used in estimating human capital stock in other countries (Lange et al., 2018). The J-F approach includes various aspects of human capital accumulation, such as education, on-the-job training, and less easily observed components of human capital such as health, abilities, and unobserved school quality.====Additionally, for comparison, we also construct various education-based human capital measures. Therefore, we create a new panel dataset on various human capital measures that covers all provinces in China from 1985 to 2014. The data will be useful for empirical work and policy analysis. For example, the human capital measures in the dataset can be used in estimating production functions, in economic growth models or convergence models, as well as in growth accounting and development accounting analyses. Moreover, in order to explore policy implications on human capital development, we apply Divisia decomposition techniques to investigate how regional factors contribute to the human capital growth.====To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has yet investigated regional human capital dynamics in China using various measures. Therefore, this study can shed new light on the development of regional human capital and on the internal dynamics of human capital across regions. We find that the human capital stock measure based on the J-F framework relates more closely to regional disparities, while education-based measures, especially average years of education, generally underestimate regional disparities. Our results show that regional human capital gaps are enlarging, especially between the economically advanced East and the other regions. Moreover, we find that education and urbanization contribute the most to human capital quality growth, while population aging appears to have a strong negative effect on human capital in China.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II summarizes the related literature on human capital measurements and introduces the Jorgenson-Fraumeni approach. Section III presents the data. Section IV discusses human capital estimation methodology in China with the J-F approach. In section V, we discuss regional distributions of human capital in China. In section VI, we introduce the Divisia decomposition methodology and estimate the contribution of various factors to regional human capital growth.

As hypothesized by Bisin and Verdier (2001), the transmission of preferences can be “vertical” or “horizontal”. Using a unique source documenting the variation in fertility behavior in Europe before and after the first demographic transition (1830–1970), I unpack the influence of parents (measured by source-country fertility at the time of departure from Europe) versus the influence of peers from the same source-country (measured by fertility of the same-age cohorts living in the source-country and transmitted by same-age recent immigrants). I find that the transmission mechanism is crucially affected by the number of foreign-born immigrant peers living in the same MSA. On one hand, the “vertical” channel of transmission is stronger in places where there are few newly arrived foreign-born immigrant couples from the same source-countries. On the other hand, the “horizontal” channel prevails in MSA’s densely populated by recently arrived immigrants from the same source-countries of second-generation ones.","Economists have shown growing interest in the effect of culture on outcomes, social norms and traits such as living arrangements, labor force participation, level of trust and fertility decisions to name a few.==== However, the mechanism through which culture is transmitted is still a black box, for culture can be very “sticky” or rapidly evolving according to the social norm of interest (see Giavazzi et al., 2019 for a recent discussion). Following the seminal contribution of Bisin and Verdier (2001), papers documenting the persistent effect of culture have not been able to distinguish between the transmission channels responsible for the persistence in social norms. Bisin and Verdier (2001) mention two distinct channels: the vertical one, that occurs from parents to children, and the oblique-horizontal one from peers (henceforth, I will refer to the latter channel as the horizontal one). In their model parents exhibit “imperfect empathy”: their utility function is affected by children’s choice to pick up one of the two social norms in the society.==== Since parents’ utility is increasing in their own social norm, they are willing to incur a cost to maximize the probability of children acquiring the parental social norm. Moreover, the socialization effort exerted by the parents decreases the larger its social group as the two channels substitute each other.====Previous empirical work studying the transmission of social norms across second-generation immigrants has taken different approaches to measure the transmission of social norms among second-generation immigrants.==== The most popular of these is the epidemiological approach, which I adopt in this study. According to this strategy, the explanatory variable capturing the persistence of social norms among immigrants and (or) their children should be measured in the country of origin of the parents that migrated (henceforth ==== in this article) to reflect the prevailing social norm of interest.==== However, a careful analysis of the previous literature shows that data availability has generally limited the choice of such variable. For instance, Alesina and Giuliano (2010), Algan and Cahuc (2010), and Ljunge (2014) use the same World Value Survey’s waves to obtain dependent as well as independent variables when using the epidemiological approach. While this strategy shows that cultural norms play a role in determining several outcomes, it does not shed light on the transmission channel through which cultural norms persist.====My approach takes one step forward in trying to unravel what is the transmission mechanism that leads to cultural persistence. Focusing on individual fertility decisions (i.e., the number of children born) of second-generation married women living in the U.S. between 1910 and 1970, I use a pooled Negative Binomial model to perform a “horse race” between the vertical and horizontal transmission channels of preferences in Bisin and Verdier (2001). This article uses two peculiar proxies to measure these two channels and shows that, under certain assumptions, both channels are in place during the period of interest. I then discuss the mechanism that drives either channel to prevail in the data.====In the paper, I measure the vertical channel using lagged values of marital fertility rates in ==== (hereinafter ==== where ==== is the Census year in which a second-generation woman is surveyed) as the explanatory variable for the number of children a second-generation woman had at the time of the Census. The reasoning underlying this choice is that, in the presence of vertical transmission, I expect the number of children of second-generation women to be correlated with the ==== measured in immigrants’ ==== at the time of migration of their parents.====Measuring the horizontal channel, that is the transmission of values from foreign-born peers that migrated from the same ==== to second-generation women, is more challenging. First, because of the reflection problem (Manski, 1993), one cannot use the ==== computed among peers in the U.S. at the time of the Census. Second, the transmission of fertility preferences from U.S. (non-immigrant) natives should also be controlled for as this group can influence second-generation women as well. To address these two issues, I use contemporaneous values of Marital Fertility Rates in the ==== (i.e., ====) as a measure of the horizontal transmission of fertility preferences from foreign-born immigrants that migrated from Europe one generation after the parents of the second-generation women in the sample. During the time window analyzed, 1910–1970 U.S. Censuses, fertility rates underwent sharp changes in the ====. I assess the validity of ==== as a proxy for the horizontal channel by showing that the fertility choices of foreign-born women that migrated to the U.S. from the same ==== of second-generation women are correlated with ==== (i.e. contemporaneous values of Marital Fertility Rates in the ====) but, crucially, not correlated with ====.====While ==== in the ==== is not influenced by the fertility of U.S. (non-immigrant) natives, I further address the possibility that the dependent variable of interest is affected by this channel in the empirical analysis. That is, I control for fertility transmission from U.S. (non-immigrant) natives to second-generation women by including a fixed effect for the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)  ×   Year in which the woman is observed. The inclusion of these fixed effects captures time-varying and MSA specific unobservables that might influence fertility decisions such as the U.S. (non-immigrant) natives’ number of children in a given MSA  ×  Year.====The empirical analysis relies on the variation over time in ==== enabling the inclusion of both ==== and ==== in the same model. This strategy is possible using data from a unique source documenting fertility decisions for almost one hundred years (i.e., from 1880 to 1970) in almost thirty European countries before and after the first fertility transition occurred Coale and Watkins (1986). To address the issue of auto-correlation between ==== and ==== and show that the two variables capture distinct channels of transmissions I collect an alternative source of fertility (Mitchell, 2003) to instrument for ====. Under the assumption of a linear relationship between the instrument and ====, I show that results are unchanged when using two different sources for the vertical and horizontal transmission of preferences.====Results from the pooled Negative Binomial model shed light on how both channels of transmission play a role in the persistent effect of cultural norms on family size. In particular, the persistent effect of horizontal (vertical) fertility preferences is such that an increase of one child in the ==== marital fertility rate is associated with an increase by a factor of 1.086 (1.073) in the number of children a second-generation woman had.==== Note that the presence of time-varying unobservables is still a challenge to the internal validity of the results.====I then analyze the mechanism that drives the two channels to be significant using the geographical and time variation of foreign-born location preferences in the U.S. In line with the theoretical results in Bisin and Verdier (2001), I find that the presence of foreign-born married couples within the same MSA is strongly correlated with the horizontal transmission of fertility norms. Therefore, second-generation women living in MSA’s that underwent inflows of foreign-born immigrants ended up having preferences that were closer to their peers in the ==== rather than their parents’ ones. Conversely, whenever an MSA did not experience the inflow of foreign-born peers, the vertical transmission channel dominates over the horizontal one.====The findings in the paper come with some caveats. Because I do not observe where the women in the sample were born and lived before filing the Census, I cannot completely rule out that immigrants’ self-selection into areas with a high (or low) density of foreign-born peers drives the results. If this is the case, the estimates are likely to be an upper bound of the horizontally and vertically transmitted cultural effects. An additional caveat is that women in MSA’s with a large presence of foreign-born men are more likely to marry them and may have to (rather than prefer to) “adopt” a preference for family size driven by their foreign-born partners.==== Finally, the time frame analyzed is such that education information is only available for a subset of the sample.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature about cultural transmission of preferences with a special focus on the studies looking at second-generation migrants and using the epidemiological approach. Section 3 describes Coale and Watkins (1986) data on fertility and explains how individual data on married couples was chosen for Censuses from 1910 to 1970. Section 4 explains the identification strategy adopted together with its advantages and drawbacks with respect to what has been done in the past. Section 5 shows the results of the pooled Negative Binomial estimation and suggests a potential channel through which the transmission of preferences observed in the data occurred.

We investigate how product-level Chinese imports react to tariff binding arising from China's accession to the WTO, by distinguishing both country-related and firm-related margins. Our main results suggest that a decline in TPU allows access to a greater variety of foreign goods, that are also associated with higher quality. At the same time, tariff binding leads more Chinese producers and trade intermediaries to start importing, thus allowing a greater number of firms and consumers to enjoy potential gains from imports. Finally, we document heterogeneous TPU effects across firms with different ownership, as well as across products with different end use, revealing interesting insights into the context of global value chains.","It has been well established in international trade literature that firms need to pay large sunk costs in order to start exporting (Roberts and Tybout, 1997). Uncertainty over future trade policies may therefore postpone a firm's decision to enter foreign markets. One of the main principles underlying the World Trade Organization (WTO) is the predictability of national trade policies, which would imply a reduction in uncertainty, providing a better environment for making irreversible investments. An instrument used to pursue trade policy predictability is binding tariff rates on goods, through which WTO members make an enforceable commitment not to increase ==== above certain ceilings (====). Following the Uruguay Round in 1995, developed countries exhibited a higher share of product lines with bound tariffs than developing countries (99% vs. 73%). Moreover, it is worth noting that, despite tariff binding, relevant uncertainty can still persist if the gap between bound and applied tariff (====) is relatively high. This discrepancy is quite common amongst developing countries, whereas in developed countries, applied rate and bound rate tend to be the same.====Recent studies have already highlighted that trade policy uncertainty (TPU) may negatively affect firms’ export behavior. Handley (2014) studies, theoretically and empirically, how TPU defers a firm's entry into the export market (====) and makes firms less sensitive to applied tariff cuts (====). In particular, using product level data from Australia during the 1991–2001 period, he estimates that the entry of foreign varieties increases by 4% if applied tariffs are reduced to zero, and by 17% if tariffs are also bound by WTO commitments. Similar findings are also confirmed in the context of/ preferential trade agreements. Using firm-level data on Portuguese exports, Handley and Limão (2015) document that the reduction of uncertainty arising from Portugal's accession to the European Community (EC) in 1986 implied a significant increase in the entry of Portuguese exporting firms into EC markets.====This paper aims to empirically explore how trade policy uncertainty may influence firms’ import behavior – rather than export behavior – given that previous works had documented that firms also have to face large sunk costs in order to start importing (Andersson et al., 2007; Kasahara and Rodrigue, 2008, Kasahara and Lapham, 2013). For example, they need to search for foreign suppliers, check whether foreign inputs can be easily integrated into the current production process, learn customs procedures, eventually acquiring import licenses, etc. These costs tend to be higher when the distance from trade partners is considered, in terms of physical distance, but also language, culture, legal system, and so on.====Moreover, we expect the discussions above on TPU and firms’ export decisions to be even more pertinent for firms’ import decisions since, by incorporating foreign intermediate inputs, they can imply irreversible changes in production technology. Indeed, while exporting only indirectly affects production by means of learning-by-exporting and changing demand, importing directly influences the production system and productivity (Zhang, 2017). In addition to static gains from using foreign inputs, due to quality and variety effects on current productivity (Amiti and Konings, 2007), firms may benefit from dynamic gains due to import experience, implying changes in future productivity (Zhang, 2017). Indeed, importing allows firms to directly change their knowledge about production, through technical support from their foreign suppliers, or to indirectly improve their know-how, through larger investments in R&D.==== Import decision may also be characterized by partial irreversibility because of frictions that can hinder adjustments in firms’ sourcing decisions, such as time delays in negotiating with new input suppliers, frictions in matching with foreign suppliers, or harmonization with other input or investment decisions (Ramanarayanan 2017).====Given that when making an import decision, a firm needs to take into consideration that international outsourcing and related trade reforms generate both short-term and long-term effects, some costs of starting import activities are sunk, as well as the firm's import status cannot easily be changed in every period, import behavior may therefore be dramatically affected by trade policy.====Using Chinese (ordinary) trade transaction data during the period 2000–2006, we explore how tariff binding, arising from China's accession to the WTO in December 2001, affects imports at the product level. We first make a country-related analysis, differentiating the product-level import value between the number of country-varieties (====) and the average imports per country-variety (====), focusing in particular on the on the country-extensive margin to verify whether a reduction in Chinese TPU positively affects the entry of new foreign varieties into China. In line with Handley (2014)’s findings, our results suggest that, subsequent to tariff binding, the Chinese economy has been able to access a greater range of foreign varieties, especially from developed countries, which are typically associated with high-quality. However, we find different results across product groups distinguished according to their end use, suggesting that whereas the decisions made by worldwide firms to supply final and intermediate goods to China tend to be delayed by China's TPU, their decisions to supply capital goods are actually brought forward. Moreover, while consumers benefit from a wider range of all foreign final varieties, firms enjoy access to both a greater variety and higher quality of intermediate varieties.====Next, we carry out a firm-related analysis, differentiating the product-level import value between the number of importing firms (====) and average imports per firm (====), focusing more closely on the firm-extensive margin to see whether a reduction in Chinese TPU positively affects the entry of new Chinese firms into the import market. We document that tariff binding leads more firms to start importing a given product. This effect is confirmed for both producers and trade intermediaries, and suggests that a larger number of Chinese manufacturing firms are able to import foreign intermediate inputs, directly or indirectly, and therefore benefit from potential productivity gains due to TPU reduction. In other words, it seems that TPU tends to delay a firm's decision to import intermediate inputs. At the same time, we also find that TPU would hasten a firm's decision to import capital goods. Finally, it appears that tariff binding pushes more foreign-owned manufacturing firms located in China to import intermediate inputs under the ordinary trade regime – through which they are not obliged to re-export, as they are with the processing trade regime – and more foreign-owned intermediaries to be involved in importing final varieties. These results suggest that FDI in China is starting to become relatively more market-seeking than resource-seeking following Chinese TPU reduction: i.e. foreign multinationals tend to relocate the downstream stages of global value chains relatively more than the upstream stages in China.====These findings are robust when considering the binding gap, when excluding the foreign TPU effect, and when exploring either the import frequency of products or the import reaction to applied tariff cuts following tariff binding. Similar conclusions are reached when replicating the firm-related analysis at both the product/country level and the firm/product/country level.====This work is complimentary to two recent studies on trade policy uncertainty and export behavior in China, carried out respectively by Handley and Limão (2017) and Feng et al. (2017). Handley and Limão (2017) theoretically show that TPU reduction can lead more firms to start exporting, and a larger number of incumbent exporters to upgrade their technology, implying an increase in both the number of exporters and average exports per firm. Then, using 6-digit product level data on Chinese exports to the US, they show that uncertainty reduction arising from China's accession to the WTO in 2001 implied a significant growth in Chinese exports to the US market in the period 2000–2005. Feng et al. (2017) also study, theoretically and empirically, how Chinese exports to the US are affected by a reduction in trade policy uncertainty following China's accession to the WTO. More specifically, by using Chinese firm-product level data, they show that TPU reduction has allowed the entry of new firms into the export market, and led to the exit of some incumbent exporters, as well as demonstrating that, compared to export-stoppers, export-starters are associated with lower prices and higher quality.==== Unlike these two studies, we focus on Chinese firms’ import reactions to the reduction of domestic TPU in a context of multilateral trade, rather than concentrating on Chinese export reactions to foreign TPU reduction in that of bilateral trade (US-China), through the exploitation of the time-varying binding status of product lines, rather than the ====. It is worth noting that while our country-related results approximately confirm their findings, i.e. that a foreign country's TPU reduction leads more domestic varieties, mostly associated with higher quality, to enter the international market, our firm-related analysis provides interesting new insights from an import perspective in the context of global value chains.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used, also giving information about the context. Section 3 sets up the empirical strategy for exploring product level linkage between imports and trade policy uncertainty.

This emphasis fits very well the trade liberalization experience of China following its accession to the ==== in 2001. In this paper, we build a multi-sector heterogenous-firm model with trade in both intermediate goods and final goods, and we ask: How do final-goods producers respond to trade liberalization in imported inputs? Do they respond differently across sectors? How do firms respond differently to trade liberalization in imported-outputs instead? We separate the total effect of trade liberalization into those caused by inter-sectoral resource allocation (IRA) and by within-sector selection of firms according to productivity (which we call Melitz selection effect). It is the IRA effect that gives rise to differential impacts of trade liberalization in different sectors. These impacts include changes in the probability of entry into the export market, the fraction of firms that export and the share of export revenue. To test our hypotheses, we carry out both quantitative analysis and empirical analysis by using Chinese firm-level data. The results are consistent with our theoretical predictions.","The focus of the literature surrounding trade liberalization has recently shifted from trade liberalization in imported final goods to studying the effects of trade liberalization in imported intermediate inputs. This emphasis fits very well the trade liberalization experience of China following its accession to the WTO in 2001. We build a multi-sector heterogenous-firm model with trade in both intermediate goods and final goods, and we ask: How do final-goods producers’ entry, exit, production and exporting decisions respond to trade liberalization in imported intermediate goods? Do they respond differently across sectors? How do these firm responses affect the aggregate exporting performance? How do firms respond differently to trade liberalization in imported-outputs as opposed to imported-inputs? We then test our hypotheses using Chinese firm-level data for the years after China’s accession to WTO in 2001.====How firms’ behaviors are affected by bilateral trade liberalization of final goods has been analyzed by Melitz (2003) and many follow-up papers. However, not all episodes of trade liberalization have been bilateral in nature and many of them resulted in mainly tariff cuts on intermediate goods. Firms respond differently to different types of unilateral trade liberalization. When there is unilateral reduction of tariffs on imported final goods, the firms in the domestic country are hurt, as foreign products become relatively cheaper and therefore more competitive in the domestic market. When there is unilateral reduction of tariffs on import-inputs, the domestic final goods producers benefit because it reduces their costs. The recent literature in global value chain (e.g. Johnson, Noguera, 2017, Koopman, Wang, Wei, 2014) shows that trade in intermediate inputs has become increasingly important to global trade. This has prompted economists to switch their attentions to trade liberalization in intermediate goods. As we shall demonstrate in this paper, firms respond differently following unilateral trade liberalization in intermediate goods than liberalization in final goods.====It is widely recognized that China long enjoyed the most favored nation (MFN) treatment from its major trading partners prior to joining the WTO.==== China’s accession to the WTO has been generally believed to have involved a primarily unilateral reduction of import tariffs (see, for example, Fan et al. (2018)). This view can also be verified by Fig. 1, which summarizes the trend of changes in different types of tariffs in China during the period 2001–2006. Chinese customs data (refer to Fig. A.1 in the appendix) shows that the majority of Chinese imports were for intermediate goods rather than for final goods (see, for example, Fan et al., 2018). Intermediate goods and capital goods accounted for 74% and 19% respectively, and final goods accounted for only 4%, of the total value of imports of China during the period 2001–2006. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the main consequence of China’s accession to the WTO is an unilateral trade liberalization of intermediate inputs. Chinese final-goods producers in general enjoyed the cost-saving in inputs associated with this episode of trade liberalization, and this paper shows that different sectors responded differently to this event. In addition, we also analyze and test the impact of an imported-output tariff change and an export tariff change respectively.====To understand how different sectors respond differently to unilateral trade liberalization in imported inputs, we develop a model that incorporates Ricardian comparative advantage and Eaton and Kortum (2002) type of selection of intermediate inputs into a multi-sector, two-country version of Melitz (2003) monopolistic competition model with heterogenous firms. We use the model to explain how comparative advantage and economies of scale interact to affect firms in sector with different initial comparative advantage differently. We then analyze the effects of unilateral trade liberalization, with a special focus on imported-input trade liberalization. We decompose the total effect of trade liberalization into those caused by inter-sectoral resource allocation (which we call IRA effect) and by within-sector selection of firms according to productivity (which we call Melitz selection effect).====Following imported-input trade liberalization, all final-goods firms enjoy cheaper intermediate goods. Melitz’s selection effect predicts that, in each final-goods sector, such liberalization tends to increase the productivity cutoff for survival and reduce the productivity cutoff for exporting within the sector, and this tends to increase the average productivity of the firms serving the domestic market in that sector. All sectors are affected equally. On the other hand, the IRA effect predicts that such liberalization leads to resources in the home country being reallocated towards the sectors with stronger initial comparative advantage. The IRA effect also tends to raise the productivity cutoff for survival and lower the productivity cutoff for exporting. The effect is larger, the stronger is the initial comparative advantage of a sector.====The interaction of the Melitz selection effect and the IRA effect causes firms in different sectors to respond differently to imported-input trade liberalization. The theory predicts that, for the sectors with stronger initial comparative advantage, the probability of entry into the export market for previously non-exporting firms, the change in the fraction of firms that export, and the change in the revenue share from exporting, are all higher. We test the hypotheses related to these reallocative effects of trade liberalization using Chinese firm-level data for the years 2001–2006, that is, around the time of China’s accession to WTO in 2001. We choose China because its accession to the WTO has been widely recognized as primarily unilateral reduction of import tariffs and a vast majority of China’s imports were intermediate goods in the covered period. We use the tariff data from the WTO database to estimate the industry-level imported-input tariffs and use the trade flow data from CEPII to estimate the industry-level reveal comparative advantage (RCA) index to proxy for sectoral comparative advantage.==== The estimation results confirm the predictions of our theory. Our results are robust to various alternative econometric specifications and alternative measures of imported-input tariff reduction and RCA index. In addition, we show that our results are not driven by other potential mechanisms such as currency appreciation and Multi-Fibre Arrangement.====Our model can also be used to investigate other types of unilateral trade liberalization. Our theory predicts that unilateral trade liberalization in imported final goods, which we call imported-output trade liberalization, results in the domestic final-goods firms facing more competition from foreign firms, which leads to opposite effects on firms’ exporting behaviors when compared with imported-input trade liberalization. Our empirical findings also verify this theoretical prediction. Furthermore, reduction of tariffs on the domestic country’s exported final goods reinforces domestic final-goods firms’ competitiveness in the foreign market; thus, it has a similar effect as imported-input trade liberalization. However, our empirical results show that the effect reductions in export tariffs would be not significant since the variations in the changes of export tariffs are small.==== Here, we do not test the impact of the changes in the trade policy uncertainty since it is out of our theme.====Focusing on the imported-input trade liberalization, our paper is naturally linked to an emerging literature that relates the effects of improved access to imported intermediate inputs to firm performance. Imported-input trade liberalization allows firms to access to cheaper intermediate inputs, and thus become more competitive. Dimensions in which superior performance are measured include improved total factor productivity (Amiti, Konings, 2007, Halpern, Koren, Szeidl, 2015, Gopinath, Neiman, 2014), upgrading of product quality (Amiti, Khandelwal, 2013, Fan, Li, Yeaple, 2015, Bas, Strauss-Kahn, 2015), and product scope expansion (Goldberg et al., 2010). Most of these papers focus on the effects of the imported-input trade liberalization within a sector. In contrast, we focus on the effect of the initial comparative advantage of sectors affecting the resource reallocation across sectors. While the within-sector Melitz selection effect presented in the literature is included in our model, we contribute to the literature by introducing the inter-sectoral resource allocation caused by the initial comparative advantage of the sectors, which leads to more fruitful results regarding the cross-sectoral variations in the effect of imported-input trade liberalization. Another difference between our paper with these papers is that they adopt a partial equilibrium approach. In our paper, we build a general equilibrium model to analyze the effect of different types of unilateral trade liberalization. Antras et al. (2017) developed a general equilibrium model by incorporating the choice of intermediate goods from different sources into Melitz (2003) paper and studied the extensive and intensive margins of firms’ global sourcing. Despite the similarity in the modeling technique in the input-bundle choice, the focus of our paper is quite different.====The theory part of our paper also shares some common features with the literature introducing Ricardian comparative advantage into the Melitz type of firm heterogeneity. Okubo (2009) incorporates multiple-sector Ricardian comparative advantage into the Melitz model, and analyzes the general equilibrium effects, allowing for the endogenous determination of the relative wage. Bernard et al. (2007) incorporate firm heterogeneity into a two-sector, two-country Heckscher–Ohlin model, and analyze how trade leads to the reallocation of resources, both within and across industries. Inter-sectoral resource reallocation changes the ex-ante comparative advantage and provides a new source of welfare gains from trade as well as causes redistribution of income across factors. A common feature of these papers is their focus on the bilateral trade liberalization of final goods. In our paper, we model trade in both intermediate goods and final goods, and analyze the effects of imported-input trade liberalization on final-goods firms’ exporting behavior. Moreover, we carry out detailed empirical tests of the theory.====Finally, our paper is also related to the strand of literature that analyzes the difference between the effects of trade reforms in the final goods market and those in the intermediate goods market. Amiti et al. (2007) show that, compared with trade liberalization in final goods market, trade liberalization in the intermediate-goods markets has a far more important impact on firms’ productivity. On the other hand, De Loecker et al. (2016) analyze the difference between the effects of imported-input tariff reductions and imported-output tariff reductions on firm-product markups. In this paper, we analyze the different effects of imported-input tariff reductions and imported-output tariff reductions on intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral resource allocation.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a two-country, multi-sector model with heterogeneous firms, where there is trade in intermediate and final goods, and examines the properties of the global equilibrium. We analyze the pattern of specialization and trade and identify the existence of inter-industry trade as well as intra-industry trade. In Section 3, we analyze the effects of trade liberalization, focusing on that of imported-inputs, and demonstrate how the IRA effect and Melitz selection effect interact in the two-way trade sectors, which differ from each other according to their strengths of comparative advantage. We also carry out a quantitative analysis of the model to verify the theoretical predictions. In Section 4, we describe the specification of the empirical tests to be carried out, the data sources and the construction of the measures for the key variables such as tariffs and RCAs. In Section 5, the empirical tests of the propositions presented in Section 3 are carried out. In Section 6, we carry out various robustness checks for the empirical estimations.

By introducing a previously unused dataset on 19th century rainfall levels in Africa, I provide the first empirical examination of this hypothesis. I find a strong negative relationship between rainfall shocks and the number of slaves exported from a given region. I also find that extreme temperature shocks in either direction increase slave exports. Building on the detailed qualitative work of Dias (1981), Miller (1982), and others, I provide quantitative evidence for interethnic group conflict and more localized forms of violence being likely mechanisms through which these additional slaves were acquired. These results contribute to our understanding of the underlying ==== of the African slave trade.","The African slave trade significantly altered modern economic and cultural outcomes. Areas that exported more slaves tend to have lower levels of development, be less trusting, display increased ethnic stratification, have lower literacy rates, and have an increased prevalence of polygyny (Nunn, 2008, Nunn, Wantchekon, 2011, Whatley, Gillezeau, 2011, Obikili, 2015, Dalton, Leung, 2014). What caused certain regions to export more slaves than others?====One line of thought in the historical literature argues that climate conditions, particularly droughts, played an important role. Historians suggest that Africa suffered a prolonged dry spell from 1630 to 1860, which helped facilitate the growing slave trade (Brooks, 2003, 102-3). In addition to attributing the growth of the slave trade to shifts in the mean level of rainfall, historians also attribute spatial and temporal variations in the slave trade to short-run fluctuations in rainfall. This connection is made in geographically dispersed areas — from Senegambia to Angola to Mozambique (Curtin, 1975, Miller, 1982, Newitt, 1995). Periods of drought are thought to have increased the number of slave exports due to increased conflict, people selling themselves into slavery, and migration that left populations vulnerable (Lovejoy, 2012, 29). On the other hand, Zeleza (1997, 34) calls these previous claims “an inept attempt to ‘blame’ the slave trade on nature and the victims themselves,” and Fenske and Kala (2015) suggest rainfall may be positively correlated with slave exports.====I introduce a previously unused dataset on 19th century rainfall levels in Africa (Nicholson, 2001) to provide a direct empirical examination of the role of rainfall conditions in the African slave trade. Using data from 1801–1866, I find a strong negative relationship between rainfall shocks and the number of slaves exported from the region experiencing the shock. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the previous year’s rainfall level is estimated to decrease annual slave exports from a port by roughly 475 slaves. I also examine the role of temperature shocks and find strong evidence for a global U-shaped function where extreme temperature shocks in both directions increase slave exports.====Building on detailed qualitative work of Dias (1981), Miller (1982), and others, I explore the role of four different channels through which these additional slaves may have been acquired: interethnic group conflict, local violence, the internal demand for slaves in Africa, and disease outbreaks.====Historians suggest that rainfall conditions during the slave trade pushed certain groups, such as the Imbangala in Angola, to shift labor allocation between interethnic group conflict and agriculture (Miller, 1982). In general, it is suggested that conflict was the largest producer of slaves during the trans-Atlantic slave trade (Lovejoy, 2012, 85). I use geocoded data on interethnic group conflict in Africa (Brecke, 1999) to show that both rainfall and temperature shocks are negatively correlated with the likelihood of conflict. The negative coefficient for temperature is consistent with Iyigun et al. (2017) who find a negative relationship between temperature and conflict during the Little Ice Age in the Northern Hemisphere. Previous work has argued that Africa also exhibited abnormally cool weather during this time period (Holmgren, Tyson, Moberg, Svanered, 2001, Johnson, Barry, Chan, Wilkinson, 2001, Nicholson, Nash, Chase, Grab, Shanahan, Verschuren, Asrat, Lézine, Umer, 2013). These results provide support for interethnic group conflict being an important mechanism through which climate conditions impacted slave exports.====The historical literature on 19th century Angola also relate rainfall shocks to local violence or coercion against community members, family members, or even oneself. One consumption smoothing strategy available in this context was the selling of family members, commonly children, into slavery at substantially reduced prices (Dias, 1981). Children were also frequently used as ‘pawns,’ or debt collateral, in West Africa. When loans were defaulted on, the pawns would be sold into slavery (Sparks, 2014, 138). Kidnapping of vulnerable individuals along the coast was also common (Sparks, 2014). To examine the potential role of this mechanism, I utilize the fact that some slave voyages recorded the demographic composition of the slaves exported. I find that rainfall shocks are negatively correlated with the proportion of slave exports that are children, thus providing quantitative support for this mechanism.====Keeping slaves domestically was also common practice in West Africa. While males were typically exported, females were typically kept for the internal slave market in Africa (Geggus, 1989). In fact, some have suggested that higher levels of female slave exports may be indicative of internal economic hardships (Klein, 1997, 36). Using the demographic data from slave voyages, I find limited evidence that rainfall or temperature conditions are correlated with female slave exports.====Finally, I examine the potential role for disease epidemics to explain the relationship between climate conditions and slave exports. Africans primarily suffered from European diseases during drought conditions. In response, slave traders would try to sell off their accumulated holdings quickly to avoid suffering a financial loss from increased mortality (Miller, 1982). If this inventory response to disease outbreaks is playing a major role in the relationship between droughts and slave exports, trans-Atlantic slave mortality should increase during drought conditions due to the disease burden. I find little evidence for this hypothesis.====Overall, I find that interethnic group conflict and local violence are the two mechanisms with the greatest support empirically for explaining the relationship between climate and slave exports. This corroborates the historical literature where these two mechanisms are emphasized. On the other hand, I find less support for the internal market for slaves and disease outbreak mechanisms, which, though mentioned in the historical literature, are not as prominent. It is important to note that this is a positive analysis of the economic conditions under which the slave trade in 19th century Africa operated. While I focus on the supply-side, these results are only possible with an elastic demand curve.====This work is most similar to Fenske and Kala (2015). Fenske and Kala (2015) use data from 1730–1866 to show a strong negative relationship between temperature and slave exports. They build an economic model where higher temperatures increase the costs of maintaining a slave raiding army by decreasing agricultural yields and increasing the disease burden. The model suggests that rainfall would be positively correlated with slave exports. In contrast, I find a strong negative correlation between rainfall and slave exports.====To explain this apparent discord, I show that the relationship between temperature and slave exports is better rationalized by a global U-shaped function. This matches well with contemporary studies finding a global U-shaped response of conflict to temperature shocks when operating through the opportunity costs of agricultural production (Burke et al., 2015). Furthermore, I show that the slave exporting regions of Africa were experiencing abnormally cool temperatures during this time period, and thus, a linear specification would be weighted towards the negatively sloped portion of the global function. This cooling is consistent with previous work on African paleoclimatology and the timing of the ‘Little Ice Age’ more generally (Holmgren, Tyson, Moberg, Svanered, 2001, Johnson, Barry, Chan, Wilkinson, 2001, Nicholson, Nash, Chase, Grab, Shanahan, Verschuren, Asrat, Lézine, Umer, 2013).====A global U-shaped response of slave exports to temperature and a negative response to rainfall is consistent with the role of opportunity costs in agricultural production. In general, agents optimize their labor allocation over agricultural production and non-agricultural sectors in response to shocks to the economic environment. For example, farmers in developing countries increase non-agricultural labor allocation in response to lower commodity prices (Adhvaryu et al., 2015). Similarly, negative commodity price shocks in labor intensive, agricultural industries can increase conflict (Dube and Vargas, 2013). Households can also allocate additional labor to the sale and manipulation of human assets. In cultures with dowries, violence against women tends to increase during adverse weather shocks in an attempt to extract further dowry payments (Sekhri and Storeygard, 2014). In Tanzania, attacks on elderly women accused of being witches increase during extreme climate conditions (Miguel, 2005). As discussed above and elaborated upon below, similar mechanisms were available in the 19th century African context. Thus, increased opportunity costs of foregoing agricultural production could decrease slave exports in response to adverse climate shocks.====The aggregate response of slave exports to climate conditions will depend on the relative degree to which opportunity and explicit costs are driven by climate conditions.==== My results suggest that, in general, the role of opportunity costs is larger than that of explicit costs, i.e., the relative returns of agricultural production are more responsive to climate shocks than the explicit costs of slave production. The competing channels of opportunity and explicit costs are also a useful framework for explaining the regional heterogeneity in the results. For example, when restricting the data to East Africa, the coefficient on rainfall is actually positive (though insignificant), suggesting the explicit costs of the slave trade may play a larger role. I argue that the ==== system in Mozambique, where slave armies were kept by non-African settlers that could not be sold and that generally did not participate in agricultural production, is a potential reason for the greater relative importance of explicit costs in East Africa.====This paper relates to a growing literature examining the determinants of slave exports. On the European-side, previous work examines the importance of managerial ability, market distortions, and the 1807 British Slave Trade Act in contributing to the temporal and spatial variation in slave exports (Dalton, Leung, Dalton, Leung, 2015b, Lovejoy, Richardson, 1995). On the African-side, studies emphasize geography, temperature, disease immunity, the introduction of new crops, and the gun-slave cycle as determinants of the level or price of slave exports from a given region (Nunn, Puga, 2012, Fenske, Kala, 2015, Esposito, Cherniwchan, Moreno-Cruz, 2019, Whatley, 2018). I show the importance of rainfall conditions in explaining the temporal and spatial variation in slave exports, and provide new empirical tests supported with qualitative evidence for the specific manner through which these additional slaves were likely acquired.====The rest of the paper is outlined as follows.

The instrument is the interaction of donor government fractionalization and the probability of receiving aid. The dataset includes new data on military expenditure for 124 recipient countries over the 1975–2012 period. When accounting for outliers, our results do not suggest that development aid affects military expenditure in the full sample. However, the effect of aid on military expenditure varies across characteristics of recipient and donor countries, even after excluding outliers. First, aid increases military expenditure in countries that depend on aid and are prone to conflicts. Second, aid provided by coordinated market economies increases military expenditure.","Donor countries provide Official Development Assistance (ODA) to promote economic growth and development in recipient countries. Scholars disagree, however, as to whether development aid is effective in achieving these goals (e.g., Collier and Hoeffler, 2004, Dalgaard et al., 2004, Doucouliagos and Paldam, 2008, Doucouliagos and Paldam, 2011, Arndt et al., 2015). It is conceivable that aid is ineffective because it is not used for its intended purpose, indicating that aid is fungible.==== Anecdotal evidence suggests that governments in recipient countries have used development aid to rig the military. In June 2015, for example, ==== reported “British aid billions 'subsidising' third world defense budgets.”==== We use a new instrumental variable strategy to examine whether bilateral development aid increases military expenditure in recipient countries.====Finding an effect of ODA on military expenditure would provide evidence for development aid being shifted to purposes other than those intended. Since military aid is not reportable as ODA, ODA should not subsidize the recipient country's military. The study thus elaborates on whether aid is fungible rather than investigating the relationship between military aid and military expenditure. Investigating the fungibility of aid implies a focus on development aid, which is given with explicitly non-military purposes.==== A direct effect of diverting aid to unintended purposes such as increasing military activity is that the funds to execute intended development projects are missing. These absent funds are likely to confine the overall growth effects of development aid. More indirectly, even if development aid was used for the intended projects, the recipient government can use the freed-up financial resources for other purposes it would not have subsidized otherwise, such as military expenditure. Rising military expenditure, in turn, is likely to influence the country's level of violence and conflict. While military expenditure can have a stabilizing effect on conflict, Collier and Hoeffler (2007) show that increasing military expenditure has a destabilizing effect through accelerating the risk of conflict. In a similar vein, Pamp et al. (2018) find that extending mid- and long-term arms imports gives rise to a higher likelihood of sparking a new intrastate conflict. An increased risk of violence and conflict may, in turn, decrease economic growth. Consequently, increasing military expenditure might offset, or even exceed the positive effects of aid, resulting in no significant impact of aid on growth at the macro-level.====Our study has three innovations. First and most importantly, we apply a new instrumental variable for aid that has been proposed by Dreher and Langlotz (2017) in their study of aid and growth. More specifically, we use the interaction of donor government fractionalization and the probability of receiving aid as an IV. Whereas donor government fractionalization introduces variation over time, the recipient country's probability of receiving aid provides cross-country variation. The interaction term consequently varies across both time and recipient countries. To the extent that donor government fractionalization affects bilateral aid through its effects on total government spending and thus through the overall aid budget, it has been found to be a powerful IV (Dreher and Langlotz 2017). We use the resulting excludable IV to identify the causal effects of development aid on military expenditure in recipient countries. Second, we use new data on military expenditure for 124 recipient countries over the 1975–2012 period. Third, we examine whether the effect of aid on military expenditure is heterogeneous across characteristics of recipient and donor countries. Investigating heterogeneous effects helps to better tailor policy implications for the different groups of recipient countries. Tailored policy implications for individual groups of recipient countries may prevent donor countries from applying one-size-fits-all policy measures that are likely to harm development aid effectiveness. We consider differences in recipient countries based on political institutions, aid dependence, conflict, corruption, income, and across different types of donor countries.",Does development aid increase military expenditure?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718301136,10 June 2019,2019,Research Article,223.0

In this paper, we study the relationship between earthquakes and terrorism. In the short run, the destruction generated by a medium-range earthquake reduces the opportunity cost of rebelling against the government. Since destruction of infrastructures in these cases is limited, the state keeps most of its coercive capacity, which reduces the chances of full-fledged conflict but leaves open the possibility of low intensity rebellious acts such as terrorism. In the medium run the destruction of tangible assets can lead to the closing down of weak firms, the introduction of new technologies, the improvement of productivity and the increase in wealth inequality We propose a new algorithm to classify terrorism events as domestic or transnational, and show that the likelihood of a domestic terrorist event increases with the previous occurrence of an earthquake. Using earthquakes as an instrument for income, we also show that development has a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of terrorist events.","The last few years have seen a growing number of analyses relating shocks, mostly natural disasters and climatology (e.g., rainfall, temperature, windstorms, etc.), to economic outcomes, democratization, political transitions, or violent conflicts. The exogenous nature of these events aids in the identification of their effects on a given spatial area. In other instances, these shocks are used as instruments to analyze the transmission mechanism of other relevant variables, primarily income. This literature has evolved towards the use of panel data or increasingly smaller geographical areas.====Recent papers have examined not only the short-run impact of such idiosyncratic shocks but also the long-run consequences. In some cases, the propagation mechanism is institutional inertia. Dell (2012) argues that drought severity during the time of the Mexican revolution affected long-run economic performance through differences in the intensity of insurgency across Mexican regions and the effects of the latter on a land institution called “ejido.”==== Belloc et al. (2016) claim that earthquakes decrease the probability of shifts from a feudal regime to communal institutions and, through institutional inertia, potentially affect economic development in the long run. Other times the persistence of the impact of a natural disaster is channeled through a technological development. Hornbeck and Naidu (2014), for example, show that the 1927 Mississippi Flood produced a large and persistent out-migration of African-Americans that led to an increase in the capital intensity of agricultural activities of flooded counties, spurring economic development. The extent of the impact of natural disasters can also vary in terms of the adoption of new technologies. Using yearly data between 1470 and 1990, Jia (2014) finds that while droughts increased the probability of peasant revolts in China, the integration of sweet potatoes (i.e., the new technology) dampened the effects of these shocks on conflict. In other cases, the long-run effect is explained by the permanent nature of the shock. Hornbeck (2012) analyzes the long-run effect of large dust storms in the US during the 1930s. Significant erosion of the topsoil produced a reduction in agricultural productivity lasting many decades after the storms. (Brancati, 2007) shows that very high intensity earthquakes produce an increase in the probability of civil wars. Medium to high intensity earthquakes do not, however, seem to have such a strong effect. However, as the destruction of infrastructures is limited in most cases, the state keeps its coercive capacity, reducing the chances of a full-fledged conflict but leaving open the possibility of low-intensity rebellious acts such as terrorism.====Human societies have cohabited with earthquakes since prehistory. In his ====, John Stuart Mill discusses the benefits of earthquakes: they destroy old capital and encourage manufacturers to introduce efficiency savings in the production process (Robinson (2018)). John Milne, the so-called ”father of seismology,” argued that ”earthquakes create a lot of business” (as quoted in Robinson (2018)). The famous geophysicist James Jackson (2006) describes the relationship between human settlements and earthquakes as a ”fatal attraction,” since the advantages of living in seismic areas outweigh the disadvantages (Jackson (2006)).====In this paper we analyze the long term effects of earthquakes on the likelihood of terrorist attacks in very small areas. Natural hazards, like shocks, are local random events that produce an immediate economic impact. The literature introduced previously has found that while this type of negative economic shock has an immediate destructive effect at the local level, it may also end up generating wealth through a mechanism of creative destruction. More specifically, an earthquake destroys tangible assets, which, by a process of natural selection, can lead to the closing down of weak business, but also the introduction of new procedures and technologies by the smarter surviving firms. Businesses that survive, and have the ability to update their capital and introduce new technologies, will increase their productivity. Therefore, in the short run, an earthquake deteriorates production capacity, but in the long run productivity increases. While there is evidence that natural disasters may promote growth (Noy and Vu (2010), Loayza et al. (2012)), the overall long run increase in wealth may be unequally distributed. This is true, for example, if part of the population loses their houses (that is, their basic source of wealth), while some of the surviving entrepreneurs see a potentially large increase in productivity and wealth. A rise in inequality can generate social tension, and drive different forms of violent acts and terrorism. This effect could take time to happen and is potentially very persistent in nature since, as shown in the literature, inequality has much inertia.====Earthquakes, can also produce an inadequate response from the government and generate, or exacerbate, previous grievances of the population in the affected area. The salience of these grievances may also increase if government reaction in helping the poor, or a particular ethnic/religious/social group, is perceived as slower/weaker than that provided to other groups. If the recovery of economic activity is rapid, due to the creative destruction process, then the opportunity cost of rebellion will quickly decrease. In this case, economic conditions may recover, but resentment towards authorities will remain long after the occurrence of the earthquake. Therefore, due to grievances caused by either the inadequate reaction of authorities, or by the persistence of inequality, the effect of earthquakes can translate into violent acts many years after their occurrence.====In this paper, we aim to understand the long-run impact of earthquakes on domestic terrorism. To this end, we conduct a geographically detailed empirical analysis, at the sub-national level, for all countries in the world over the period 1994–2007. Our units of observation are grids defined as 120 km x 120 km cells. This unit of analysis covers the intersection of pixels generated by a high resolution grid and countries, defined as a pixel-country cell (henceforth, cell). To date, the empirical literature on terrorism has largely relied on cross-country data. Moreover, and with very few exceptions (e.g., Enders et al. (2011), Piazza (2011), Choi and Piazza (2016), and Enders et al. (2016)), previous studies have predominately analyzed international terrorism. Research on the quantitative study of transnational terrorism includes the work of Sandler et al. (1983), Im et al. (1987), Enders et al. (1992), and Enders, Sandler, 1993, Enders, Sandler, 1999, among others. More recent work includes Krueger and Laitin (2008), Krueger and Maleckova (2002), Piazza (2006), Abadie and Gardeazabal (2008), Keefer and Loayza (2008), and Savun and Phillips (2009). An important motive for their focus on international terrorism is data availability. Enders et al. (2011) pioneer a new method to identify transnational versus domestic terrorist events based on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). (Piazza, 2011), using this data, revisits the relationship between poverty and terrorism and suggests that minority economic discrimination is an important factor in explaining domestic terrorism.====Our analysis presents the following novelties with respect to the previous literature. First, we construct a new dataset on domestic terrorist attacks. While much research focuses on international terrorism, we analyze domestic terrorism.==== It is well known that international terrorism represents only a small and decreasing part of all terrorist events (Sandler, 2014). Moreover, the causes of domestic and international terrorism may be quite different (Sandler, 2014). Given that many studies at the cross-country level use only international events to infer the general determinants of terrorism, this paper helps to better understand the differential determinants of both types of terrorism. To this end, we present a new working definition of domestic terrorism==== so as to separate the latter from international terrorism in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), using information on the profiles and biographies of the perpetrator groups. This material allows us to distinguish domestic from international events for the period 1970 to 2007 for all countries in the world affected by terrorism, and construct this new dataset on domestic cases. We also compare our data with that resulting from the methodology of Enders et al. (2011).====Second, we geographically locate all domestic terrorist events. In contrast with most of the previous research on conflict and terrorism, our analysis is carried out at the sub-national level. Although many terrorist organizations have a local origin, the majority of the literature on the causes of terrorism is based on country-level data.==== While it may make sense to use countries as a unit of observation in studies on international conflict, where the state is assumed to be a unitary actor, domestic terrorism involves at least two actors within the boundaries of a state.==== Neglecting within-country variation may distort the interpretation of the determinants of domestic terrorism. We therefore aim to analyze the local determinants of terrorism so as to uncover space-varying features that contribute to explaining terrorism on a subnational level. To this end, we use pixel-country cells as the basic unit of observation.====Geographic disaggregation is particularly important when studying the role of economic shocks, as some of the effects of such shocks on the likelihood of terrorist attacks will be localized. Angrist and Kugler (2008), for example, show that in areas of Colombia where coca cultivation increased violence also increased. Dube and Vargas (2013) show that the sharp fall in coffee prices in Colombia lowered wages and increased violence mostly in municipalities where coffee was the predominant source of income. Harari and La Ferrara (2018) also use very small areas (at the cell level) to analyze the role of climate change on conflict.==== They argue that the effect may be quite localized since rain, temperature, and the evaporation index depend crucially on the type of soil and its ability to retain water. Their multi-scalar drought index changes significantly according to different areas within each country. There is also important variance within countries in terms of topographic characteristics such as elevation or roughness of the terrain. Ciccone (2011) similarly concludes that uncovering the effect of precipitation on the risk of conflict requires more than cross-country disaggregated data. There are thus both theoretical and empirical reasons that encourage the use of high-level geographical disaggregation in the study of terrorist acts.====Third, and in contrast with other studies on the interaction between shocks and violence, we consider countries around the world as opposed to Africa alone, although we also check the robustness of the results using only cells in African countries.====Finally, we investigate the relationship between earthquakes and development, and its impact on terrorism. We argued above that earthquakes can generate, in the long run, an increase in productivity and growth. To support this argument, we analyze the effect of the level of development on the likelihood of terrorism using earthquakes as an instrumental variable. There has long been debate over the relationship between development and terrorism. Most of the literature finds no effect of poverty, or development, on terrorism at the country level. However, at this level of aggregation, it is difficult to disentangle the effect of development on terrorism as the process can go in either direction, generating an important endogeneity problem. By disaggregating domestic and transnational terrorist incidents and time series, Enders et al. (2016) establish a robust nonlinear relationship between income and terrorism. More specifically, they identify transnational terrorism by distinguishing between the location of the attack and the victims’ nationality, finding a correlation between low per capita income and transnational terrorism.==== Nemeth et al. (2014) find, using sub-national cells, a negative effect of gross cellular product on terrorism. In contrast with this finding, using individual data on terrorists, Krueger and Maleckova (2002) show that terrorists have a higher than average level of education.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows.

These individuals are born in Europe, and they have been exposed to institutional, legal and labor market structures of their countries, including the tax rates. Their fathers are first-generation immigrants who migrated from 47 different countries. I construct measures of “taste for leisure” in the country of origin of each immigrant father. I employ average and marginal tax rates for each country of residence, and control for individual characteristics, in addition to a large set of attributes of the country of residence and country of origin. I demonstrate that systematic selection of first-generation immigrants (the fathers of the individuals analyzed) to countries of destination based on the tax rates is unlikely. The results show that for women, both taxes and culture of leisure impact labor force participation and hours worked. For men, taxes influence labor supply both at the intensive and the extensive margins, but culture of leisure has no impact. The results are insensitive to the omission of immigrants from Muslim countries.","There are substantial differences between people around the world regarding how many hours they work in the labor market. For example, in 2012, the average annual hours worked by American workers was 1750. The average worker in Germany worked 17% fewer hours than an American worker in that year, and a French worker worked 15% less. A worker in Belgium spent about 9% less time at work in comparison to an American worker. Similar disparities are observed when hours per person are analyzed, instead of hours per worker.==== Annual hours worked per working age population (ages 15 to 64) are 10% lower in Germany, 19% lower in France, and 17% lower in Belgium in comparison to the U.S.====In an influential paper, Prescott (2004) employed a growth model with a representative household and calibrated the model to show that the difference in hours worked between the United States and Europe in two points in time can be explained almost entirely by the differences in the tax rates on labor and consumption. A large literature that followed provided a number of nuanced extensions and modifications to Prescott's framework, regarding the preferred labor supply elasticities to calibrate such macro models, modifications to the model to incorporate the ability for the household to self-insure through asset accumulation, the role of productivity growth, and so on (e.g. Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2006, Ohanian et al., 2008, Rogerson, 2008, Olovsson, 2009, Chetty et al., 2011, McDaniel, 2011). In a different framework, Algan and Cahuc (2005) showed that family labor supply attitudes were important in explaining the variation in the employment rates of different demographic groups in OECD countries.====The finding that taxes are a major factor in explaining cross-country differences in market work is important because it implies that reductions in taxes can generate significant increases in economic activity. Alternative, or at least complementary, hypotheses have been proposed to explain the differences in hours worked between Europe and the U.S. These include the importance of regulations and labor unions (Alesina et al., 2006), and the role of home production (Olovsson 2015). An important aspect of this discussion, and the key component of this paper, is the role of preferences for leisure. The assumption of identical preferences between countries, and in particular between Europeans and Americans has been questioned (Blanchard 2006). This point is also emphasized by Alesina et al. (2006) who suggested that an initial decline in market work might increase individuals’ utility from leisure and this process can be amplified by a social multiplier (Glaeser et al., 2003) if there exist complementarities in leisure – individuals’ utility from leisure is enhanced when more people are consuming leisure.====The argument that Europeans have stronger taste for leisure than Americans (Blanchard 2004) is perhaps intuitive, and fits well with many people's pre-conceived image of longer vacations and shorter work weeks in most European countries. That image was brought to life in a Cadillac TV advertisement in the U.S., where the main character in the advertisement, an American middle-age upper-income male, first asks the question: “Why do we work so hard?” In answering his own question, he declares:====Although tastes for leisure can impact labor supply, no systematic analysis has been conducted on this subject.==== This paper focuses on European countries and investigates the impact of taxes and the ==== on labor supply. Using a large micro data set consisting of individuals from 26 European countries I analyze people's labor supply decisions both at the extensive and the intensive margins.==== While there are significant differences between Americans and Europeans in hours worked, there are also substantial differences in market work ==== European countries. To demonstrate the extent of variation between countries in hours worked, Table 1 displays hours worked per population ages 15 to 64 in 2012 in a sample of European countries, calculated using the OECD data. This measure contains two dimensions of market work: the fraction of the working age population that actually works and the number of hours of those who work. The entries in Table 1 are standardized to portray average hours worked in each country relative to the U.K. For example, hours worked per person in France, Germany and Greece are 19%, 10%, and 3% lower, respectively, than in the U.K. Swedes work 4% more than the working age population in the U.K. Importantly, as shown later in the paper, there is also substantial variation in the effective marginal tax rates between European countries.====The critical issue for the purposes of this paper is how to measure the “taste for leisure,” and how to identify its impact on market work. To that end, I focus on ==== immigrants who reside in various European countries. These individuals are born in Europe, and they have been exposed to institutional, legal and labor market structures of their countries of residence, including the marginal tax rates on labor and consumption income. Their fathers had migrated from somewhere else in the world, and we know these fathers’ countries of origin. Immigrant father's country of birth determines his ancestral roots, and it is assumed that culture of leisure in father's country of origin is transmitted from the immigrant father to the offspring. I focus on the father, rather than the mother because most of the literature uses the birth place of the father to assign country of origin to second-generation immigrants (Alesina et al., 2015, Alesina and Giuliano, 2011, Alesina and Giuliano, 2010, Fernández and Fogli, 2009, Card et al., 1998). By exploiting a separate data set that asks people around the world various questions to gauge their ====, I connect these second-generation immigrants in Europe to the culture of leisure in their father's country of origin.====I analyze the labor supply of second-generation immigrants who are born in the countries to which their fathers have migrated. It is conceivable that fathers’ migration decisions were motivated by the tax rates in the countries of destination. For example, people from those countries where leisure is valued highly could have chosen to migrate to destination countries which have high tax rates. If this is the case, such self-selection of migrants as a function of destination country tax rates could confound the estimated impact of taxes on the labor supply of the second-generation. To investigate this possibility, I divide the analysis sample into two groups: the countries with above-median tax rates, and the countries with below-median tax rates. I show that the observed characteristics of the second-generation immigrants and the characteristics of their immigrant fathers are balanced between these two groups of destination countries. Furthermore, the indicators of “taste for leisure” in the countries of origin are balanced as well, minimizing the concern of first-generation's (fathers’) self-selection based on the tax rates.====Data are from about 7000 individuals who live and work in 26 European countries. These individuals have ancestral origins in 47 different countries.==== Thus, it is possible to ==== in the country of residence on hours worked, holding constant observable attributes of individuals, various attributes of the country in which they live, and attributes of their father's country of origin, including the taste for leisure in that country of origin. Similarly, one can identify the impact of ==== on labor supply, holding constant all personal attributes and various characteristics of the country of residence, including the tax rates. To eliminate, to the extent possible, the factors that may impact the labor market activity of the individuals stemming from the demand side and institutional structure, I control for such variables as the unemployment rate, per capita income, legal origin, religious make-up, as well as the size of the population and average education of the country of destination. A similar set of covariates is included for the country of origin. These variables are described in the data section below.====The results show that both taxes and culture of leisure impact labor force participation and hours worked for women. For men, taxes influence labor supply both at the intensive and the extensive margin, but culture of leisure has no impact. The magnitudes of the estimated effects indicate that while taxes on labor income are a significant determinant of aggregate hours worked, ==== is important as well.====This paper is also related to a growing new literature that investigates the interplay between culture and economic outcomes. Some recent examples include Fernández and Fogli (2009) who investigate the impact of female labor force participation and fertility rates in the country of origin on work and fertility decisions of second-generation American women; Alesina and Giuliano (2011) who investigate the impact of family ties on political participation, labor force participation and trust. Luttmer and Singhal (2011) report that immigrants’ redistributive preferences are impacted by the average preference in their country of birth. Ljunge (2014) analyzes the transmission of trust to immigrant children. Alesina et al. (2015) find that people who inherit strong family ties are less mobile and have lower wages and higher unemployment. A detailed description of this literature can be found in Alesina and Giuliano (2015) and Fernández (2011).",Taxes and culture of leisure: Impact on labor supply in Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718302208,24 May 2019,2019,Research Article,225.0

Making use of a large panel dataset of manufacturing firms, we find that, on average, both foreign-owned enterprises (FOEs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have performed better than privately owned enterprises (POEs) in terms of their TFP levels. However, while FOEs’ TFP ranked the highest in the period 2001–2006, SOEs “closed the gap” in the period 2007–2011. Moreover, we find that market competition has been effective in enhancing average firm productivity and in reducing the gaps in efficiency across ownership types. SOEs’ remarkable performance may be linked to several concurrent factors experienced during the period 2001–2011, namely, the process of restructuring the state sector during the 2000s, the increased economic integration due to the country's accession to the World Trade Organization (2007) and, finally, the preferential access to financial capital and land granted to SOEs. While some evidence supports SOEs’ equitization as an explanation for their remarkable productivity performance, ==== accession and cheaper access to inputs do not fully explain it.","Vietnam has achieved tremendous economic growth since the 1986 launch of the ==== (“renovation”) program, which set the country on a path to gradually turning away from central planning in order to transit towards a market economy (Pincus, 2016). In the period 1986–2010, the year-on-year growth rate of Vietnam's gross domestic product (GDP) was, on average, around 7% (see Vo and Nguyen, 2007, Minh and Long, 2008, World Bank 2011, Malesky and London, 2014; among others).====The ==== policy is based on three main pillars (Pincus, 2016). The first pillar aims to achieve the mobilization of underutilized land and labor in the production of goods. Indeed, agriculture and labor-intensive manufacturing — conducted by small firms and household enterprises — have spurred Vietnamese growth during this period. Since the 1990s, the state has withdrawn from its former omnipresence in the economy; however, it has maintained strategic control over several industries (see Vu Thanh, 2014) via state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which constitutes the second pillar.==== Finally, the third pillar aims at integrating the Vietnamese economy into the world market by fostering exports and through reduced import tariffs (Vietnam's accession to the WTO occurred in 2007) and by expanding the scope of incoming foreign investment (World Bank, 2011).====Vietnam's recent development has puzzled scholars for several reasons, making explaining the country's success less than clear-cut. As for its institutions, the country's political system is a communist, single-party regime, where participation in political decisions is limited to a few people (Malesky and London, 2014); the judicial and regulatory institutions are still not fully developed (Pincus, 2016); and the effectiveness of competition law and regulation authorities have been questioned, at least up to the second half of the 2000s (Vo and Nguyen, 2007).==== As for the economy, the expansion of the private sector has gone hand in hand with the state-led development policy intended to make several SOEs to be “the main engine of the economy” (Malesky and London, 2014).==== Moreover, the growth model followed by Vietnam since the mid-1980s has been based more on the accumulation of resources than on the growth of productivity (labor and capital accumulation accounts for around 80% of GDP growth during this period).====Even if the less than impressive productivity figures, together with low wages, widespread underemployment and the relevance of the agricultural sector,==== may suggest that the ==== model has not yet been fully exploited (see Malesky and London, 2014, Pincus, 2016), in the long run, Vietnam's growth will only be maintained through sound productivity dynamics. Given this, it is timely to enquire into the determinants of productivity in Vietnam.====Several features of the ==== program may have had an effect on Vietnamese firms’ productivity. First, is the recognition and promotion of private domestic and foreign entrepreneurship. Since the early 1990s, but mostly after 2000, several changes in the legal environment (see Section 2) incentivized the establishment of many privately owned enterprises (POEs) and the entry of foreign-owned enterprises (FOEs) and applied a single unified legal framework to all firms. Second, during the same period, the equitization of several SOEs and changes in their governance took place (World Bank, 2011), together with state-led development policies aimed at establishing a few large state-owned groups able to exploit internal linkages and economies of scale and scope (Vu Thanh, 2014, Pincus, 2016). Third, the number of firms active in Vietnam, and therefore, market competition, has increased precisely because of these legal changes. Fourth, the accession of Vietnam to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007 has further enhanced market competition, both by boosting the exporting activities of Vietnamese firms and by reducing tariffs for foreign competitors (Vo and Nguyen, 2007, Baccini et al., 2019).====Despite the debate over Vietnamese firms’ performance gaining momentum in the last 15 years thanks to the increasing availability of firm-level data (see Ngoc and Ramstetter, 2004, Nguyen and Le, 2005, Ha and Kiyota, 2014, Nguyen, 2017, among others), general evidence on the role of ownership and market competition in productivity remains sparse and inconclusive (Ramstetter and Ngoc, 2013, Huang and Yang, 2016, Baccini et al., 2019). This is unfortunate because at this stage of Vietnam's development it is necessary to deepen our knowledge in terms of these two major determinants of firm productivity.====In this paper, we take advantage of a large panel dataset of Vietnamese manufacturing firms observed over an entire decade (from 2001 to 2011) to empirically assess the role of ownership and competition in firm productivity. The focus on manufacturing allows us to analyze the relative performance of different ownership types in sectors characterized by relatively low levels of regulation and increasing exposure to international competition.====This yields two main results. We find that once controlled for a large set of firm, industry and province characteristics, both FOEs and SOEs show, on average, higher total factor productivity (TFP) levels than POEs during the period 2001–2011. Moreover, SOEs, while lagging behind FOEs in the first sub-period (2001–2006), “closed the gap” with foreign-invested firms in the period 2007–2011. As a second result, we find that market competition has enhanced average firm productivity and reduced gaps in productivity across firms of different ownership types (viz., FOEs, SOEs and POEs), providing some evidence of the role that competition has played in Vietnam's recent transition path (Vo and Nguyen, 2007, Pincus, 2016). The results are robust to Heckman's two-stage procedure to control for the possible selection (non-randomness) of businesses kept in the hands of the state.====The good performance of SOEs in the period under analysis may certainly be explained by multiple causes, and we discuss them at length in Section 5.2. First, several internal reforms may have operated in the direction of a superior average performance of SOEs with respect to POEs. Smaller and less efficient SOEs were forced to dissolve or merge with other units in the 1990s (World Bank, 2005), while a large share of SOEs still extant at the beginning of the 2000s were equitized a few years later (Vo and Nguyen, 2007, World Bank 2011). Second, the New Enterprise Law enacted in 2000 favored a boom in the number of POEs, with many young private businesses entering the market. These were, on average, characterized by a lack of commercial experience (Pincus, 2016) and the adoption of simple technologies (Nguyen and Le, 2005, Ramstetter and Ngoc, 2013), which may have mapped onto a lower average productivity level of POEs in comparison with SOEs. Third, Vietnam's joining the WTO in 2007 may have strengthened the process of restructuring and the reallocation of market shares and the selection of SOEs via both exporting activities (by favoring the expansion of the most productive firms) and import competition (by forcing the least productive firms to shrink or even exit the market). Finally, we discuss the possibility that this result may have also stemmed from the easier access to factors of production (i.e. financial capital and land) granted to SOEs in the period under analysis.====Overall, while we find some evidence to show that the equitization process increased the efficiency in the governance of SOEs, neither the “liability of privateness”, due to the lack of commercial and technical capabilities, nor a larger effect of trade and economic integration for SOEs, with respect to POEs and FOEs, find strong support. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that part of the remarkable productivity performance shown by SOEs is linked to the favorable conditions granted to these firms in accessing land and financial capital.====This study contributes to the literature on Vietnam's growth path and its determinants (see Minh and Long, 2008, Malesky and London, 2014, Pincus, 2016; among others) by providing a comprehensive overview of TFP in Vietnamese manufacturing during the period 2001–2011, when relevant institutional and economic changes took place. In addition, this work contributes to the empirical literature on the joint role of private ownership and market competition in firms’ productivity. Indeed, the two have long been considered by both scholars and policy makers as the major forces behind effective transitions from central planning to market economies.==== Finally, our paper relates to the literature on the role and evolution of state ownership in transition countries (see Hsieh and Song, 2016, Lazzarini and Musacchio, 2018, Baccini et al., 2019, among others).====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

We examine the impact of the first wave of housing reforms, which untied access to housing in urban areas from working for the state sector. We find that the reform significantly increased private housing ownership and private-sector employment, and reduced private-sector wages. The housing reform had no effect on unemployment or self-employment.","One of the key economic events of the late twentieth century is the transition of centrally planned socialist economies to market economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, 36 countries have experienced economic transition, affecting over 40% of the world’s population, only ten of which had completed the process by the beginning of the new millennium (IMF, 2000). An essential component of economic transition is the movement of labor from state employment to private employment. This has featured prominently in the IMF’s policy recommendations to Eastern European transition economies during the early 1990s (Mitra et al., 2002) and in the highly profiled ==== report by the World Bank and the Chinese State Council (World Bank, 2012, p. 88). In this paper, we study the untying of access to urban housing from state-sector employment in China. The main outcomes of interest are private housing ownership, the sector of employment and wages. Did the housing reform increase employment in the private sector? How did it affect wages in the infant private sector? Did it increase grassroots entrepreneurship? The answers to these questions are important for understanding the Chinese transition experience. They are also more generally interesting because most transitioning economies experience similar changes, where state-sector employment is untied from access to important non-wage benefits, amongst which housing is obviously one of the most important.====The Chinese context offers several advantages for understanding the details of economic transition. In contrast to Eastern Europe, the Chinese transition process took place under political and macroeconomic stability, and there was considerable variation in the timing of economic reforms across Chinese provinces and cities, which facilitates econometric identification.==== The limited population migration across cities in China enables us to treat each city’s labor market as relatively isolated. Though there was no comprehensive firm-level survey in the early transition years, we are able to use China’s ==== (UHIES) to measure employment status, housing ownership and wages. Note that private enterprises in this household survey are businesses started by individual entrepreneurs and are distinct from privatized state firms which have been the focus of most other studies of the private sector in China.====The two main empirical challenges to our paper are data availability and causal identification. To address the first challenge, we construct a novel dataset on city-level reform dates using information from province-level newspapers in the National Library archives in Beijing. Our main variable of interest is the date of the first reform which untied access to housing from state-sector employment.==== We combine these data on reform dates with UHIES household survey data for a panel of 27 cities over 1986–2005. Since the reforms were introduced at different times across cities, we can use a difference-in-differences approach to compare labor market choices of household heads or individuals before and after the introduction of the housing reform, between cities that have already introduced it and those that have not. Our baseline specification includes city fixed effects, which control for all time-invariant differences across cities, and year fixed effects, which control for all changes over time that affect cities similarly, such as macroeconomic changes or introduction of national policies (including the national law on urban housing reform enacted in 1994). Since the timing of the reform was determined in part by pre-reform city government revenues, we show that our results are robust to controlling for pre-reform city government revenues interacted with year fixed effects.====We find that the housing reform increased private ownership of housing and had a large and statistically significant impact on the probability of a household head being employed by a private-sector firm. Between 1986 and 2005, employment in private firms increased from zero to 6.7% of the total urban labor force. We find that the housing reform accounts for 30% of the total increase in private-sector employment. It also reduced wages in the infant private sector relative to state-sector wages. A one standard-deviation change in the timing of the reform reduces wages by 0.21 standard deviation for an individual working in the private-sector. As we will discuss later in the paper when we interpret the results on wages, there are likely to be several forces behind the negative effect on relative private-sector wages: a shift of labor into the private sector, the decline of housing subsidies in the state sector, and possible negative selection out of the public sector. We provide suggestive evidence against the decline in housing subsidies driving our estimates. It is beyond the scope of our paper to be more conclusive on this point.====Interestingly, we do not find any increase in the probability that the household head owns his/her own business – i.e., is an entrepreneur or self-employed. Together with the results on private-sector labor supply, these results are consistent with the belief that untying job-specific benefits increases worker mobility, but cannot spur entrepreneurship without other changes such as the relaxation of credit constraints. To further investigate whether the main results are driven by the untying of benefits from state-sector employment, or income effects from the monetization of private housing, we control for the introduction of a second reform, which enabled households to buy and sell housing. Our main results are unchanged by this control, which again supports our interpretation that untying access to housing from state-sector employment is the main driving force.====The main caveat for interpreting the reduced form estimates is that the housing reform may be confounded with concurrent reforms or factors that increased private-sector labor demand. We conduct a large number of robustness exercises to show that our estimates are unlikely to be biased by such factors. These include controlling for the fraction of state-owned firms in the city (as a proxy for concurrent SOE restructuring reforms), province-level GDP and employment growth trends, and pre-reform city-level employment growth trends interacted with year fixed effects. We also examine two placebo outcomes which can be interpreted as indicators of economic growth – re-employment and unemployment. We find that the housing reform had no effect on either outcome.====The main results show that the housing reform had a statistically significant and economically important impact on private housing ownership, the sector of employment and private-sector wages. Another way to examine the economic significance of the housing reform is to conduct a scaling exercise. With the reduced form estimates of the housing reform on private-sector labor supply and wages, we can ask: how much did the change in labor supply due to the housing reform affect wages? We construct a 2SLS estimate of private-sector labor supply on wages, where we use the housing reform as an instrument for labor supply.==== The estimates show that when the housing reform causes a 1% increase in the private-sector labor force, private-sector wages decline by approximately 0.29%. This supports the interpretation that the housing reform had economically important effects on the private sector.====Our findings contribute to a large literature on economic transition and structural change. Existing empirical studies in this literature have mostly been descriptive or have focused on cross-country comparisons.==== We add to these by using micro data and a policy experiment to provide detailed and well-identified evidence that untying benefits from state-sector employment can be an effective policy for gradually releasing labor into the private sector. Our general finding that the housing reform had a large effect on urban labor market choices is consistent with the work of Wang (2012), which finds that housing reforms increased entrepreneurship and attributes this finding to relaxed credit constraints. We differ from her study in focusing more on general equilibrium effects. Wang (2012) compares individuals that were previously employed in the state sector to those that were not, before and after 1994, the date of the national housing reform law. However, we find that most of the cities in our data had already enacted the housing reform prior to the national law. Our empirical strategy therefore compares the effects of reforms across cities before and after implementation, using city-specific reform dates that began in 1988 and ended in 1997. The different strategies may explain why we find no effects on entrepreneurship.====The evidence that the increase in labor mobility reduced private-sector wages adds to studies that investigate why privatization policies are unpopular despite their obvious benefits to the economy at large (e.g., Denisova, Eller, Frye, Zhuravskaya, 2009, Fernandez, Rodrik, 1991, Zhuravskaya, 2007). Since the increased movement to the private sector caused by the housing reform was gradual and voluntary, our results provide some support for gradual transition (e.g., Aghion, 1993, Roland, 1994). The empirical findings are also consistent with the theoretical study by Aghion and Blanchard (1994), which argues that to avoid unemployment and wage reductions, private-sector job creation should take priority over state-sector restructuring even if shedding labor from the state sector will increase productivity.====This study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background on privatization and housing reforms. Section 3 discusses our identification strategy and Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents the main reduced form results of the effect of the housing reform on housing ownership, employment decisions and wages, as well as the robustness exercises. Section 6 examines the economic significance of the housing reform through labor-supply channels.

We contribute to this literature by using variation in religious doctrine produced by the ==== Second Vatican Council (1962–65) to examine the impact of religion on democratization.====The Council (or simply Vatican II) was a watershed moment in Catholicism, not unlike the Protestant Reformation. According to Gonzáles (2010), Vatican II set in motion a process that could not be stopped, Wilde (2007) asserts that Vatican II represents the most significant example of institutionalized religious change since the Protestant Reformation, Payne (1984) calls it the most sweeping reform in Catholic history since the Counter-Reformation, Faggioli (2015) calls it the most important event for the Catholic Church in the last four centuries, and Williams and Davidson (1996) call it the most important event in the last one hundred years of Catholic history. Vatican II transformed the Roman Catholic Church from a defender of the ==== into a leading apostle of religious freedom, human rights, and democracy (Fleet and Smith, 1997, Huntington, 1991; Weigel 1989).====Prior to Vatican II the Church made uncompromising secular demands on its followers. Under the papacy of Pius XII (1939–58), for example, voters were left in no doubt as to the spiritual indecorum of voting against Catholic political parties. It was not until 1967, two years into the post-conciliar era, that a Dutch bishop ventured to say in public that Catholics could vote for a non-Catholic party without risking excommunication. Judt (2010) asserts that this change was a direct result of Vatican II.====In the pre-Vatican II period the Church had been intimately involved with governments around the world.==== Many countries officially recognized Roman Catholicism as their favored religion (Encyclopedia of Religion 2005d), which provided the Church with inimitable advantages.==== Vatican II weakened the power of the Church in several of these countries. The Council made clear that only free individuals can discover spiritual truth, and it even accepted that other religions (may) hold some truth.==== The Council recognized the absolute right of every individual to religious freedom, which in turn meant that the Church gave up its compulsory character and acknowledged the fundamental principle of separation of church and state (Huntington, 1991, Wilde, 2007).==== The Church's espousal of the modern human rights discourse allowed it to play a vital role in the democratization of the Catholic world (Casanova, 2012, Fleet and Smith, 1997, Weigel, 1992, Huntington, 1991, Mainwaring, 1986, Payne, 1984).====There is plenty of narrative evidence that the post-conciliar Church played essential roles in various national democratization processes. In Spain the Church played a crucial role in the demise of authoritarianism, not least by helping the country reach a constitutional compromise on church-state relations that would avoid a replay of the Spanish civil war (Linz, 1991, Payne, 1984, Gunther and Blough, 1981); in Brazil the Church vitally empowered civil society through Catholic grassroot organizations, through Church leaders’ denunciations of the repression, and through calls for a more democratic order (Mainwaring 1986); in Chile the Church kept its compatriots informed about the extent of human rights violations, and it openly challenged the regime when no one else could (Fleet and Smith 1997); in the Philippines the Church consistently spoke out against human rights violations and the misappropriation of the electoral process, it helped unite the opposition, and it played a leading role in exiling Marcos (Youngblood 1990); and in Poland the Catholic Church was instrumental in overthrowing communism through inter alia its vigorous moral and psychological support of the opposition movement (Weigel 1992).====The role of Vatican II has not received much attention in the broader literature on the determinants of democracy.==== A notable exception is the ==== work of Samuel P. Huntington.==== In his seminal 1991 book, ====, Huntington ponders what changes in plausible independent variables most likely in the 1960s and 1970s produced the dependent variable “democratizing regime changes” in the 1970s and 1980s. One of the important changes that Huntington emphasizes is the striking shift in doctrines and activities of the Catholic Church, manifested in the Second Vatican Council, and the subsequent changes in national churches from defenders of the ==== to proponents of social, economic, and political reform. However, the ==== literature on the determinants of democracy has hardly paid any attention to Vatican II in particular and only limited systematic attention to religion more generally. Barro (1999), whose estimation sample marginally predates Vatican II, does not mention the Council. He merely notes that religious affiliation has been stressed as an important determinant of democracy but that the theory of the interplay between religion and democracy is less developed than other aspects of the theory of democracy. Moreover, he places Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity into one category and then adds various (time-invariant) religion dummies to his specification. Acemoglu et al. (2008, footnote 7) note that Huntington (1991) has hypothesized that “religion might have an important effect on economic and political development”. However, there is no mention of Vatican II in their paper. Murtin and Wacziarg (2014), who analyze a sample going back to 1870, also do not mention Vatican II. They include country fixed effects, which they note account for “time-invariant factors such as religion and culture” (p. 174). Gleditsch and Ward (2006) do mention Vatican II but only in a few lines in a footnote. Mainwaring and Pérez-Liñán (2005) lump Vatican II under transnational factors but include no measure of Vatican II in their empirical investigation of democratization in Latin America. Acemoglu and Robinson (2006, p. 78), in a work on democratization theory, briefly mention “the change in the attitude of the Catholic Church” as a factor highlighted by Huntington.====The neglect of Vatican II in the extant literature is both unfortunate and surprising. It is unfortunate because the Council offers a unique opportunity to study a potentially important ==== impact of religious doctrine on democratization. And it is surprising because Seymour M. Lipset's enormously influential 1959 paper on modernization and democracy contains an inkling of the potentially important ramifications for democracy of a major reform of Catholicism such as Vatican II. According to Lipset (1959, footnote 40), “democracy requires a universalistic political belief system in the sense that it legitimates different ideologies. And it might be assumed that religious value systems which are more universalistic in the sense of placing less stress on being the only true church will be more compatible with democracy than those which assume that they have the only truth. The latter belief, held much more strongly by the Catholic than by most other Christian churches, makes it difficult for the religious value system to help legitimate a political system which requires, as part of its basic value system, the belief that ‘good’ is served best through conflict among opposing beliefs.”====The present paper is, to our knowledge, the first paper to systematically explore Vatican II's effect on democracy in a panel of countries.==== Our empirical results show that Vatican II is a strong predictor of post-conciliar democracy. This holds with and without confounders, and it holds in different subsamples. For instance, it is not driven by any politico-geographic region. It also holds in fully flexible models, where the treatment variable is interacted with pre-treatment and post-treatment time fixed effects. Moreover, it holds with a continuous and a dichotomous dependent variable as well as a continuous and a dichotomous treatment variable. Finally, we provide supporting historical narratives from different national contexts, which makes evident that the Catholic Church was an important political protagonist that helped steer authoritarian countries safely toward democracy. Overall, our research substantiates that the post-conciliar Catholic Church played a fundamental role in third wave democratization.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides some background on Vatican II and its impact on the Catholic Church's thinking about matters of democracy. Section 3 contains the quantitative analysis. Section 4 traces out pathways from Vatican II to democratization in different national contexts. Section 5 discusses the time delay between Vatican II impulse and democratization response.

Using data from China Family Panel Studies, we find that mother's education increases adolescents’ school enrollment, math test scores, college aspiration, and internal locus of control related to education. Mother's education also improves adolescent mental health status and reduces the incidence of underweight. We also find considerable gender heterogeneity in the effects of mother's education. The results further indicate that mother's education leads to an increase in family resources for children and an improvement in maternal mental health and parenting, which we interpret as potential mechanisms behind our findings."," To promote children's well-being and enhance equality of opportunity, many developed countries have implemented various policies targeting children, especially disadvantaged children (====). To design effective policies, understanding the origins and development of capabilities is crucial (====The prominent role of parents’ schooling, especially mother's schooling, in the process of child cognitive and noncognitive development has been emphasized in the literature (====). Mothers’ education can influence their children's outcomes through nature (genes), nurture (environment), and particularly, interactions between the two. For instance, the intergenerational associations of human capital may be largely driven by inherited genetic factors (====, ====, ====). Regarding nurture, mothers with more education may create more nurturing and healthier home environments for child development, such as having more economic inputs, better parenting behavior, greater information processing capacity, and higher efficiency in human capital investment (====, ====, ====).====Economists are particularly interested in the nurturing effect (i.e., the causal effect) of mother's education from a policy perspective. Promoting gender equality in education is a priority area of ==== for developing countries, including China. Public policies targeting investments in women's education improve the education of one generation in the short run, and have long-run societal benefits by improving child outcomes. Notably, a causal link from the mother's education to child outcomes is difficult to demonstrate. The association between mother's education and child outcomes might be driven by unobserved maternal characteristics, for example, inherited abilities.====A number of studies have investigated reforms in compulsory schooling laws to identify the causal impacts of mother's education on child outcomes in developed countries. The findings have been mixed. For example, ==== find that the intergenerational effects of schooling are significant but small in Sweden. ==== find that the effect of mother's education on children's education is only significant for sons but insignificant for daughters in Norway. Consistent with ====, ==== also find positive effects of mother's education on sons’ cognitive and noncognitive skills and health status in Sweden. Focusing on children aged 7–15, ==== find that parental education has reduced the incidence of grade repetition in the United States.==== However, ==== find little evidence that mother's education has a causal effect on the health of infants and children aged 7, 11, and 16 in the United Kingdom.====In addition to exploiting compulsory schooling reforms, ==== use college openings in the United States and find a positive effect of maternal education on infant health. ==== exploit geographic variation in schooling costs during the mother's adolescence and show that maternal education has improved children's test scores, reduced the incidence of behavioral problems and grade repetition, but had no effect on obesity at ages 7–8 and 12–14.==== However, ==== find weak evidence of a causal relationship between mother's education and infant health in the United States, using school entry policies as an instrument for education. In summary, despite the growing attention to mother's education, the literature still falls short of an adequate understanding of the causal mechanisms, especially for developing countries.====Compared with developed countries, developing countries generally provide less social protection for children, in terms of nutrition, health, education, and other child-related services. Thus, mothers may play a more important role in the process of child development. Only a few of studies have been conducted to identify the causal effect of maternal education in low-income countries. They find that increased maternal education has increased early child health investments in Uganda (====), improved child test scores in Pakistan (====), reduced child mortality, and increased schooling attainment of children in Zimbabwe (====, ====).====Our paper contributes to the literature by investigating whether increases in education of mothers from rural origins improve adolescent development in China. The existing studies mainly focus on maternal education impacts on one aspect of child development or infant outcomes in China. For example, ==== show that the effect of mother's education on adopted young children's height in China is significantly positive and similar to that on the own birth children, suggesting that the education effect is mainly postnatal nurturing. Based on the 1968 education reform in Taiwan, the study by ==== shows significant positive effects of both parents’ schooling on infant birth outcomes. However, both studies present little evidence on the mechanisms behind the observed effects.====Using China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), we provide new evidence on the beneficial effects of mother's education on a wide set of child outcomes during adolescence in China. Focusing on mothers from rural origins, our results demonstrate that increases in their education induced by the compulsory schooling reform have increased the child's school enrollment, math test scores, college aspiration, and internal locus of control related to education. Mother's education also improves adolescent mental health status and reduces the incidence of underweight. These findings have valuable implications for future comparison studies on the effectiveness of public policies on child economic and social well-being in developing countries.====We identify the causal effects of mother's education on child development by exploiting the exogenous temporal and geographical variations in the enforcement of compulsory schooling laws (CSLs) in China. In 1986, the Chinese government promulgated CSLs for the first time, making 9 years of education mandatory for all school-age children (i.e., ages 6–15). This reform was gradually implemented in different provinces at different times, between 1986 and 1994. We exploit variations within and between cohorts in reform exposure to construct an instrument for schooling. Some recent studies show that an increase in education induced by this reform has increased individual earnings (====), affected noncognitive outcomes (====), but had mixed effects on health outcomes (====, ====). We add to this literature by focusing on the impact of this reform on the next generations.====Another contribution of this paper is that the rich information on child well-being provided by CFPS allows us to examine the effects of mother's schooling on various outcomes of adolescent children (i.e., ages 10–19), including school enrollment, educational aspiration, cognition, internal locus of control, self-reported general health, mental health, and anthropometric outcomes. Most of the literature has focused on early life outcomes of children or educational attainment of young adult children, and only ====, ====, and ==== have analyzed some aspects of adolescence. Moreover, few of these papers have examined mental health of the children. The mental health of adolescents in developing countries has not been thoroughly studied even though mental health problems are a leading health problem for adolescents and have long-lasting effects throughout life (====, ====). Our findings regarding various adolescent outcomes may provide additional evidence on the causal relationship between mother's education and children's success in the longer term, and contribute to our understanding of the process of human capital formation.====Furthermore, we find considerable gender heterogeneity in the effects of mother's education. The positive effects on school enrollment, math test scores, and internal locus of control are concentrated among girls, whereas the beneficial effects on adolescents’ mental health and nutritional status are concentrated among boys. Further evidence suggests two important channels for the observed pattern. First, these effects are likely to arise from the positive effects of mother's education on family resources and economic inputs in their children. Our results provide suggestive evidence that maternal education is associated with greater bargaining power of mothers within the household in China, and thus leads to better outcomes of children, especially for girls (====, ====). Second, increased education also leads to better maternal mental health and positive parenting, which may have important impacts on child outcomes (====). In contrast with the literature on developed countries, we find little evidence that education affects a woman's marriage status, fertility, birth age, and birth weight of the child.====, ====, ====). The literature has also documented an intergenerational transmission of education and health from parents to children in China (====). In this paper, we provide direct evidence that part of the intergenerational transfer of socioeconomic status may be through the effect of mothers’ education.====This paper proceeds as follows. ==== introduces the institutional background in China.

To do this, we exploit the party realignment that occurred in the U.S. due to abortion becoming a more prominent and highly partisan issue over time. We show that abortion was not a highly partisan issue in 1982, but a person's abortion views in 1982 led many to switch parties over time as the two main parties diverged in their stances on this issue. We find that voting for a given political party in 1996, due to the individual's initial views on abortion in 1982, has a substantial effect on a person's political, social, and economic attitudes in 1997. These findings are stronger for highly partisan political issues, and are robust to controlling for a host of personal views and characteristics in 1982 and 1997. As individuals realigned their party affiliation in accordance with their initial abortion views, their other political views followed suit.","Do individuals support a political party based on their views, or are their views shaped by their party identification? This is a central question in studies on the interaction between social identity and personal preferences, dating back at least fifty years to the seminal work of Campbell et al. (1960). Several theoretical and experimental studies have raised the possibility that social context has a crucial impact on an individual's policy preferences.==== However, there is little systematic empirical research on whether there is an effect of party identification on an individual's opinions. The lack of research is likely due to the difficulty in establishing a causal connection between the two. Both are jointly determined, and therefore, a correlation between views and party affiliation reveals little about the causal relationship in any particular direction.====The idea that political affiliation affects a person's views is somewhat counter-intuitive. It is natural to think that individuals choose which party to support based on their views, which results in a strong correlation between a person's opinions and party affiliation. While this is likely to be true, a substantial part of this correlation could be the result of the party's influence on the views of those who joined that party for various other reasons. For example, a person may have strong opinions about economic policies, and choose a party based primarily on which party is closest to those positions. In the process, the party may influence the person's stance on a vast array of other issues like foreign policy, criminal sentencing, judicial activism, school choice, affirmative action, school prayer, gay marriage, etc. Political parties represent a bundle of views over all issues, and it would be impossible for individuals with randomly determined views across all issues to pick a party, particularly in a two-party system, with similar views on each issue. Yet, supporters of a party often share a similar outlook over a vast array of disparate issues, and this pattern suggests that causality between party and personal views could be running in both directions.====This paper focuses on the least understood of these pathways: the extent to which party affiliation affects political opinions. In order to identify a causal relationship, exogenous variation on party preferences is required. Although a few studies have attempted to do this, their identification strategies rely on treating lagged party affiliation as exogenous (Bartels, 2002; Carsey and Layman, 2006). In contrast, we introduce a new strategy which is based on an individual's attitude towards legalized abortion, a salient issue that is generally related to one's views about when life begins versus the rights of females over their reproductive choices. A priori, it seems unlikely that a person's views on such matters should be correlated with his/her preferences on economic issues and other policy dimensions. In fact, this appears to be the case during the 1970s in the United States when the abortion issue came to the forefront of public debate. As Adams (1997) and Carmines and Woods (2002) show, the two major political parties did not stake out clear stances on abortion as of the late 1970s.====Starting in the mid-1980s, however, abortion became an increasingly partisan issue – which is in line with the idea that political parties manipulate religious issues in order to rally supporters and increase donations (Glaeser et al., 2005). As the parties diverged in their stances on legalized abortion, many individuals found themselves supporting the “wrong” party in terms of their attitudes on abortion – an issue that is often deep-seated in a person's core values. Therefore, as abortion became increasingly a partisan issue, many individuals with strong beliefs on abortion in either direction were essentially forced to change their political affiliation in the mid-1980s and early 1990s accordingly.====Using detailed panel data containing the political views of each respondent in 1982 and 1997 on a variety of issues, we show that the abortion stance of an individual in 1982 did cause party switching between 1980 and 1996. Holding a pro-life view in 1982 doubled the probability (12% to 24%) that a Democratic voter in 1980 switched his/her support to the Republicans in 1996. Holding a pro-life view in 1982 increased the chances that a Republican voter in 1980 stayed Republican in 1996 by 22 percentage points. To see if the new party affiliation affected the person's views on issues other than abortion, let us consider the example of a person's opinion about marijuana legalization. Our basic strategy is to control for an individual's personal characteristics, including their view about marijuana legalization in 1982, and test whether the individual's political affiliation in 1996 (as explained by his or her initial attitudes on abortion in 1982) affects their view about marijuana legalization in 1997. We perform a similar analysis for a host of other political, social, and economic issues.====The results show that individuals not only changed their party as of 1997 in accordance to their abortion views in 1982, but this party realignment led individuals to shift their preferences over other policy dimensions accordingly. That is, as people switched parties due to their initially held abortion views, their other political views tended to follow suit. These findings hold for a variety of political, economic, and social issues that are not directly related to abortion, but are stronger for issues that are more partisan in nature.====Our empirical strategy relies on the assumption that individuals were more likely to change their party identification than their abortion views. This assumption is consistent with a large body of evidence showing that an individual's abortion views tend to be constant over time (Converse and Markus, 1979; Tatalovitch and Schier, 1993; Wilcox and Riches, 2002; Jelen and Wilkox, 2003; Carsey and Layman, 2006). The high correlation of abortion views over time is present in our data – 76% of the individuals in our sample hold the same abortion view between 1982 and 1997, while only 53% voted for the same party. The strength of this correlation is probably due to the idea that abortion views tend to be based on deeply held religious beliefs. In addition, this issue is framed as a clash of two opposite absolutes, making it difficult for individuals to change their minds (Maxwell, 2002). Therefore, the sudden divergence in party platforms regarding abortion offers a unique opportunity to see whether this process induced individuals to switch parties, and whether that switch caused individuals to realign their views on other issues according to the new party line.====Our study is closely related to the rapidly growing theoretical literature on the relationship between a person's social identity and his/her personal preferences (see, among many others, Akerlof and Kranton, 2000; Beck et al., 2002; Shayo, 2009). This literature is based on the insights of Tajfel and Turner, 1979, Tajfel and Turner, 1986 regarding social identity. They show that an individual's political preferences are not only affected by their own self-interest, but also by their social context and the social groups they choose to identify with. These theoretical advances had been accompanied mostly by experimental evidence showing that social identity affects an individual's preferences over redistribution (Luttmer, 2001, Klor Esteban and Shayo, 2010) and level of altruism (Fowler and Kam, 2007;Fong and Luttmer, 2009).====Achen and Bartels (2016) study the effects of social identity on political outcomes. They call this line of research by the name of group theory of politics, and argue that it presents “a more scientifically accurate and politically realistic foundation for democratic theory” (Achen and Bartels, 2016, pp. 214). This theory is based on individuals’ tendency to form groups, which leads to the creation of “us” and “them” and to intergroup conflict. As a consequence, they argue that emotion (rather than reason) has a great impact on group activity. At the same time, groups have a great influence on individuals’ preferences and thinking, to the extent that group norms tend to override an individual's own judgement.====Achen and Bartels (2016) provide a number of examples highlighting the effect of social identity in shaping political attitudes. To do this, they focus on historical cases of political realignments of different groups, and argue that social identities are behind the process of partisan realignment at least as much as differences in party platforms. They show, for example, that (i) ethnicity played a substantial role in shaping the political behavior of Jews, Italian Americans, African Americans, Yankees and Irish-Americans during the New Deal era; (ii) religious identity substantially affected the 1960 US elections, with Catholics showing an unusual and overwhelming support for Kennedy; and (iii) views on race played a crucial role on the realignment of white southerners in the second half of the 20th century.====More closely related to our study, Achen and Bartels (2016) show that views on abortion caused the realignment of moral conservatives and liberals in the 1980s and 1990s. Focusing on the same data set used in this study, Achen and Bartels (2016) show that individuals are more likely to leave the Republican party between 1982 and 1997 if they held liberal views on abortion in 1982. Importantly, their analysis does not control for other covariates (besides abortion's views) that may affect this correlation.====Our study contributes to this literature by examining the way that a person's political party affiliation, which is often an important component of one's social identity, influences a person's views on a vast array of political, social and economic issues, while using econometric tools to establish causality. We show that voting for a party induces individuals to adapt their views to the positions of a prototypical member of the group they choose to identify with.====Our paper is also related to important studies by Mullainathan and Washington (2009) and Gerber et al. (2010), which analyze the possibility that views are affected by increased political participation.==== Mullainathan and Washington (2009) compare the views of individuals who were eligible to vote in a presidential election to those that were just shy of the eligible age. They find that those who were eligible to vote had stronger views than those that were ineligible. They interpret this finding as evidence of cognitive dissonance – individuals mentally adjusted their views to coincide with their previous voting behavior. Gerber et al. (2010) find further evidence that partisanship is affected by political activity using a field experiment. Before a primary in Connecticut, the researchers sent reminders to independent voters with partisan leanings that they need to register for a party in order to participate in that party's primary election. They found that individuals who received the reminder were more likely to register for a party and identify with that party than a control group of similar individuals who did not receive the reminder. They did not find an effect of increased partisanship on an individual's policy opinions, probably due to the short time elapsed between the treatment and the survey.====Mullainathan and Washington (2009) and Gerber et al. (2010) demonstrate that individuals are more likely to hold stronger and more consistent views over time if they invest more effort in their political participation and in acquiring information. Whereas Mullainathan and Washington (2009) estimate the persistent effects of electoral participation on polarized beliefs, our approach studies the effect that a permanent break on an individual's partisanship has on his or her views. Our paper focuses on how an individual's party identification affects a person's views. Individuals that switch parties because of their views on one issue do not have to adapt their views on other issues, yet they tend to do so. Cognitive dissonance is one factor that could explain why a person's views are shaped by party affiliation across a wide array of issues. Individuals may derive disutility from supporting a party that is at odds with their views on various issues, and therefore, may adapt their stances in order to increase their attachment to the new party. It is also possible that individuals supporting a new party become more open and exposed to partisan political information and argumentation, which leads them to alter their pre-existing views.====Hence, a review of the literature shows that there is little evidence on the causal effect of party affiliation on an individual's attitudes. Recent evidence does show that increased political participation and information strengthens an individual's identification with the political party that he or she supports. We build on these findings by showing how party affiliation impacts an individual's preferences over a wide array of political, economic, and social issues.",Party hacks and true believers: The effect of party affiliation on political preferences,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014759671930040X,25 March 2019,2019,Research Article,230.0

Consistent with this, we observe that ODA is significantly lower where policymakers are more susceptible to lobbying. Finally, we present a novel test of competing “crowding out” hypotheses. Self-reported private aid donations are negatively correlated with actual ODA, and positively correlated with perceived ODA. This finding is consistent with an emerging argument in the literature, whereby ODA crowds out private aid by enabling charities to forego fundraising activities and crowds in private aid through a signaling channel.","In 2015, aid flows from Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donor countries totaled $146 billion—an unprecedented high.==== Yet, despite the emergence of a large literature on the effectiveness of foreign aid in recipient countries, few studies have analyzed attitudes to foreign aid from the perspective of donor-country citizens. In this paper, we take a first look at preferences for Official Development Assistance (ODA) using unique micro-level data taken from the Voice of The People survey commissioned by the World Bank Institute and collected by Gallup International. We focus on the preferences of just under 90,000 individuals in 24 donor countries surveyed in each of the four years from 2005 to 2008.====The dataset allows us to present novel facts on four related issues: within-country variation in ODA preferences; cross-country variation in ODA preferences; cross-country variation in the gap between ODA preferences and actual ODA; and the extent to which ODA crowds out private aid donations.====We begin with a standard Meltzer-Richard style political economy model of policy formation in a democracy. Treating ODA as a pure public good, we argue that an individual’s relative income within a country-year will negatively affect her ODA preferences. This is because, in a proportional tax system, the marginal cost of a tax-funded public good is higher for those closer to the top of the income distribution. We find correlational evidence in support of this proposition in the data: those in the top income quintile favor ODA (as a share of GNI) that is 0.13 percentage points lower than the preferred share for individuals in the bottom 40% of the income distribution. Crucially, the data allow us to control for respondents’ perceptions of current ODA levels, which alone explains over 15% of variation in desired aid. This represents a critical advantage over previous studies in the literature: it reveals not only that individuals measure ODA with a non-trivial amount of error, but that the error component is negatively correlated with income. Failure to include perceptions as a control variable would therefore bias our estimate towards supporting the model’s prediction. We also show that the estimate is robust to the inclusion of a variety of interacted fixed effects for categories of education, employment, age, gender and religion.====A corollary of this simple model is that preferences for ODA (henceforth “desired aid”) will be negatively affected by the ratio of the mean to the median income level within a country; in other words, that inequality leads citizens to demand ==== foreign aid outlays. We observe patterns in the data that are consistent with this: ==== is indeed higher in countries that are less equitable, as measured either by the mean:median income ratio or by the Gini coefficient. This seems to be at odds with the fact that Nordic countries, which are among the most equitable in the world, tend to donate more ODA as a share of GNI than other OECD countries.====What can explain this puzzle? We propose one explanation rooted in a canonical model of special interest politics: if, as we show, higher income voters prefer lower ODA rates, then the gap between ==== and the realized ODA will be larger in countries where policy choices are susceptible to monetary influences, such as campaign donations or bribes. In effect, these distortions from high income special interests create a wedge between citizen preferences and eventual policy choices on ODA. We find suggestive evidence consistent with this hypothesis: conditional on a battery of controls, ODA is significantly lower in OECD countries where business managers report higher levels of lobbying activities, as measured by the Global Competitiveness Report of The World Economic Forum. The magnitude of the correlation is consistent across multiple measures of private influence on public policy.====Finally, we analyze the mechanisms through which ODA expenditure “crowds out” private foreign aid donations by citizens. The classical argument states that increased government expenditure on foreign aid reduces private donations, as people optimally withdraw their private contributions once they are obliged to donate to charities through involuntary taxes (Warr, 1982, Bergstrom, Blume, Varian, 1986). This is known as ====. However, more recent studies by Andreoni and Payne (2011a) and Name-Correa and Yildirim (2012) propose two additional pathways linking government grants to private charitable donations: an ==== channel, by which government grants allow charities to forego fundraising activities, thereby reducing private donations; and a ==== channel, through which government grants to charities signal their quality to citizens, who are more likely to donate as a consequence. Using data on local charitable donations in the U.S., Andreoni and Payne estimate an overall crowding out coefficient of around 62%, owing to a combination of indirect crowding out and direct (net) crowding in effects.====The nature of our dataset allows for a novel test of these channels in the context of foreign aid. Estimating the impact of ODA expenditure alone on private donations does not permit the researcher to untangle the direct and indirect effects. By additionally including in the regression a measure of ==== ODA, however, we argue that it is possible to separate out the direct effects, which operate through an individual’s beliefs about current ODA expenditure, from the indirect effects, which operate through the negative impact of actual ODA expenditure on charity fundraising. We apply this method and find that a 1 percentage point increase in actual ODA is associated with a 0.64 percentage point decrease in self-reported private aid, suggesting an indirect crowding out effect, whereas the same increase in perceived ODA is associated with a 0.09 percentage point ==== in self-reported private aid, suggesting a direct crowding in effect. The findings are robust to instrumenting actual ODA with measures of lobbying activities and population (which are jointly significant predictors of ODA and arguably independent of the error term), and to including a range of interacted individual-level fixed effects, the ==== variable used above, and various country-level indicators of economic activity and governance. The results corroborate emerging evidence that government crowding out is incomplete, and that it operates through reduced fundraising activities by charitable organizations in receipt of public funding rather than through the direct channel.====While the debate on the effectiveness of foreign aid is well documented, our study contributes to a relatively thin literature on the drivers of aid supply. Earlier studies tended to centre on the macro-level determinants of bilateral aid flows. Dudley and Montmarquette (1976) find that politically and economically strategic links appear to be the main drivers of aid. McKinley and Little (1979) broadly support this view, showing that US aid from 1960 to 1970 was more motivated by strategic interests than poverty. Maizels and Nissanke (1984) conduct a more nuanced test that reveals the “recipient-need” rationale for multilateral aid allocations and the established “donor-interest” rationale for bilateral aid. Alesina and Dollar (2000) and Collier and Dollar (2002) reinforce the main thrust of the literature: political and strategic concerns mainly determine bilateral aid, and allocations would be more productive if poverty and policy played a larger role.====Despite the convergence of these macro-level studies of bilateral aid supply by the early 2000s, few papers have since explored the individual preferences of donor-country citizens for foreign aid. Paxton and Knack (2012) look at correlates of support for aid increases using WVS data together with an earlier version of Gallup International’s Voice of The People survey. They identify correlations with largely attitudinal variables such as religiosity and positions on poverty, global affairs and institutions. Chong and Gradstein (2008) use World Values Survey (WVS) data to show that, at the individual level, relative income is positively associated with preferences for foreign aid. At the country level, they find that income inequality is negatively associated with actual ODA disbursements.====Our analysis builds upon this literature. Firstly, our unique dataset provides a richer foundation for empirical analysis. Whereas Chong and Gradstein (2008) have two waves of WVS data (1995–1997 and 1999–2000) consisting of 10,000 observations, and Paxton and Knack (2012) have a single wave of WVS data (5693 observations in nine donor countries) and a single wave of Gallup data (6,194 observations in 17 countries), we avail of a more recent four-wave dataset containing almost 90,000 respondents from 24 donor countries. This allows us to flexibly control for country-year fixed-effects in our individual-level regressions. Second, we avail of a survey question which measures respondents’ perceptions of current ODA expenditure—a covariate that is typically proxied by actual levels of ODA in prior studies, an approach we show to be extremely unsuitable due to respondents’ substantial misperceptions of aid expenditure. Moreover, our measures of aid preferences allow for variation on the intensive margin, rather than on the extensive margin only. Third, we propose an explanation for the discrepancy between our findings on the effects of inequality on ==== versus prior findings on the effects of inequality on actual ODA, namely that special interest lobbying is a potential omitted variable. This is the central thesis of Lancaster (2007), who discusses in detail the primacy of donor-country political-economy factors in the allocation of foreign aid. The author argues that the impact of popular preferences on foreign aid expenditure is tempered by the role of special interest lobbying. We offer empirical support for this argument. Finally, we separate the direct and indirect effects of government ODA expenditure on private contributions through the use of our ==== variable. To our knowledge, this is the first test of this nature in the context of foreign aid.====Our paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we describe our ==== data on attitudes to aid. We then propose a theory of support for foreign aid in Section 3, and empirically analyze its propositions in Section 4. We extend the analysis in Section 4 by examining country-level correlates of aid. In Section 5, we turn to our analysis of crowding out, before concluding in Section 6.",Foreign aid preferences and perceptions in donor countries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596719300393,21 March 2019,2019,Research Article,231.0

Why are absolutists unable to convert power into revenue? Supported by evidence from Imperial China, we explain this puzzle with a principal-agent model which reveals that absolutists, unconstrained by rule of law and unable to commit to not predating on their tax-collecting agents (and the masses), may find it optimal to settle for a low wage-low tax equilibrium, while permitting agents to keep extra, unmonitored taxes. Our analysis suggests that low investment in administrative capacity is a conscious ==== for an absolutist since it substitutes for credible commitment to refrain from confiscation from its agents.","Tax extraction in Qing China was low relative to the leading Western European powers of the early modern period. This is paradoxical: China was much more absolutist and had stronger rights over property and people than any European power. Why did the Qing not convert their absolute power into revenue? Did they face inherent impediments to enhancing their fiscal capacity, or was their limited fiscal capacity a conscious strategy informed by their history of governing an empire without any form of constitutional constraint?====Limited fiscal capacity is not unique to early modern China. In the contemporary world, tax collection is inversely related to economic development. Besley and Persson (2014) give a host of reasons why this is the case: the presence of a large informal economy, foreign aid, resource dependence, a non-compliance culture, and weak state capacity. Historically, many states, especially autocratic ones such as early modern Spain and the Ottoman Empire, had difficulty collecting taxes in spite of their rulers ostensibly having absolute power (Tilly, 1990, Dincecco, 2009, Dincecco, 2014, Karaman and Pamuk, 2013, Irigoin and Grafe, 2013).====One key reason autocratic institutions are associated with low tax collection is that autocrats face a particularly vexing problem of ====: what we view as a set of “paradoxes of power.” First, given that unconstrained, arbitrary power is the very foundation of absolutist rule, how can an autocrat incentivize a tax collection agent to collect taxes, when the agent might be subject to the whim of discretionary power and the fear of arbitrary confiscation of wealth?====We suggest that an unconstrained ruler's promise to refrain from predating on his agents is only credible when he has little capacity to find and extract the agent's hidden, unmonitored wealth. In such a case, there is little to gain from predation since the agent has little for the ruler to confiscate. An absolutist ruler can commit to refraining from predation—tying his own grabbing hands—when administrative capacity is weak and thus monitoring costs are high. This idea is related to Greif (2005, p. 755), who proposed that rulers can commit to protecting rights by creating an ineffective administration, which increases the cost of confiscation and thus makes property more secure.====But this solution engenders the second paradox: in the absence of a monitoring infrastructure, how could autocrats prevent their agents from extracting too much taxation from the masses, which could in turn threaten imperial rule via revolt? Myerson (2015) argues that one solution is via institutions that constrain rulers from arbitrarily firing their agents, so long as contracts are structured to pay off heavily near the end of their duration (which gives agents the incentive to act honestly). Yet, such a solution requires institutionalized monitoring as well as a mechanism which enables the ruler to credibly commit to upholding his promises. Building such institutions is not always possible in a highly autocratic regime. Our paper addresses this set of paradoxes within one coherent framework without making such assumptions.====We argue that in the trade-off between these two paradoxes emerges a “low wage-low tax” equilibrium, where rulers pay their agents low wages in return for low levels of taxes remitted to the center, supplemented with informal taxation that is de jure extralegal but de facto permitted. Rulers cannot offer high wages since such wages are not secure from their own grabbing hands, while they cannot request high levels of taxation because they must leave surplus for the agent to collect as an “extra-legal” wage (that is hidden and thus free from confiscation).====The issue (or absence) of credible commitment has been explored before. In particular, Acemoglu and Robinson (2000) and Acemoglu (2003) discuss how credible commitment issues between the ruler and masses can give rise to persistently inefficient institutions. Yet, their analysis glosses over one key feature of the “ruler-masses” relationship: rulers almost always enact policies ==== such as bureaucrats or local elites, which themselves are rife with commitment problems in a principal-agent setting. By bringing commitment problems to the ruler-agent setting, our paper contributes new insights to the central question of state and administrative capacity.==== For example, Tilly, 1990, Besley and Persson, 2009, Besley and Persson, 2010), Acemoglu (2005) and Hoffman (2015) argue that investments in fiscal capacity—and hence administrative capacity—arise endogenously precisely because of common interests in the provision of protection against external enemies.==== Our model adds to this literature by suggesting that a certain type of administrative capacity arose in Europe only in the presence of ==== an external threat ==== an internal institutional arrangement which consisted of some degree of credible commitment based on representative institutions or alternative arrangements. State capacity in these cases was often marked by the development of a fiscal-financial-legal nexus, the maturing of a market for public debt (Stasavage, 2011, Besley and Persson, 2011), and the establishment of a transparent taxation system where governments paid civil servants good wages in return for tax revenue. But this solution only worked if governments could ==== to not confiscating the agents’ wealth in times of crisis.====Our paper is of particular relevance to large empires like Qing China or large autocratic states in contemporary times. Our model indicates that an absolutist's incentive to expand territory is more likely to be internalizing an external threat than mobilizing the resources necessary to dispel a sudden external attack. When an empire expands to co-opt previously enemy territories, it has the benefit of having to defend against a smaller number of external threats and hence requiring less fiscal or administrative capacity. Thus, external warfare and territorial expansion in the case of the Qing ultimately reduced their internal fiscal capacity and reinforced the low-tax-low wage equilibrium in a large empire. This forms a contrast to the case of limited rulers, who were more likely to develop administrative capacity in the face of escalating external warfare in a multiple-state setting. Hence, our paper helps explain the historical contrast between the structure of a singular large and dominant state in China versus that of multiple, smaller states in Europe and furthermore, why early modern European states sought colonial empires while the Qing expanded on their frontier.====Although our model focuses on the ruler-agent relationship, our analysis captures the fundamental uncertainty in property rights and contract enforcement issues pervasive in parts of the world ruled by arbitrary and unconstrained rule.==== Our model therefore sheds light on a number of stylized facts from China's pre-modern era. First, it explains why the Qing rarely invested in administrative capacity and total Chinese taxation remained stationary despite population and territorial expansion. Rather than taking Confucian ideology or the Chinese ruling logic of light taxation themselves as explaining the low-taxation outcome (Rosenthal and Wong, 2011), our model suggests that low tax revenues may have been an endogenous outcome of an absolutist regime with no formal constitutional constraint, legitimated and reinforced by the Confucian ideology itself. This outcome contrasts with the constitutionally constrained regimes of Europe, which had incentive to make investments in administrative capacity and were therefore able to collect much higher taxes per capita (Dincecco, 2009, Karaman and Pamuk, 2013, Brandt et al., 2014). Second, most absolutist regimes contain an element of informal or extra-legal taxation above the official target that is permitted de facto by the ruler.==== We show that the ruler's inability to commit from confiscating the ==== income of the agents entails that, in order to keep the agent in the system, it must turn a blind eye to the agent collecting informal, ==== (to the ruler) income—permitting de facto what is illegal de jure. In other words, extra-legal taxation—often viewed as corruption—is a necessary component for an absolutist's tax administration to work properly. These insights imply that absolutist rulers faced a fundamental paradox where their unchecked power was ultimately constrained by a weak state and low administrative capacity. This therefore has implications for the long-run economic divergence between China and northwestern Europe, where the issue of fiscal and state capacity has not been given adequate attention.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 overviews the nature of absolutist power in Imperial China and lays out the main historical phenomena underlying the features of low and stationary formal governmental taxation co-existing with an entrenched element of extra-legal taxation above the official level. Section 3 presents a model which makes sense of these features. It suggests they are equilibrium outcomes in an absolutist regime with little monitoring power and no constitutional constraint. Section 4 presents further historical narratives and empirical evidence based mainly on the Qing to illustrate the model's insights. It extends the model to shed light on the long-run evolution of the Chinese imperial political structure and the comparative fiscal and financial development of other types of regimes that prevailed in early modern Europe.

Relying on new predictions derived from an heterogenous firms model (Helpman, Melitz & Rubinstein, 2008), two dimensions of diversity are investigated: the number of geographical origins (extensive margin) and the distribution of audiovisual imports across exporters (intensive margin). The empirical results reveal that per capita income fosters diversity up to point: income first has a positive impact on the extensive margin, yet beyond a certain threshold, the number of import sources declines. Regarding the intensive margin, per capita income reinforces the concentration of import flows across origins benefiting the most efficient partners.","The trade literature has recently drawn attention to the influence of income on bilateral trade patterns==== but has overlooked its impact on the ==== of imports. Yet, in certain sectors of the economy, such as the audiovisual sector, the geographical composition of imports is a highly sensitive issue in trade agreements, recently highlighted by the exclusion of that sector during the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership discussions. Concomitantly, some fears that increasing purchasing power, and especially the rise of a middle class in certain countries, is correlated with increasing attraction toward westernized lifestyle and products from Europe and America at the expense of traditional customs and values (Chua, 2002). Existing theoretical models (Janeba, 2004, Olivier, Thoenig, Verdier, 2008, Rauch, Trindade, 2009) predict that exchanges, through media and communication technologies, between individuals from different countries causes cultural convergence. These fears are corroborated with recent evidence of a Trojan horse effect (Jensen, Oster, 2009, Disdier, Head, Mayer, 2010, La Ferrara, Chong, Duryea, 2012, Maystre, Olivier, Thoenig, Verdier, 2014, Oberlander, Disdier, Etilé, 2017) of cultural imports on cultural values and tastes. Given the interactions between international trade and cultural identities, increasing income, if correlated with more concentrated cultural imports, may produce a negative externality through a decrease in cultural diversity.====The present paper confronts these fears and fills the gap in the trade literature by addressing the following question: how does income influence the geographical diversity of imported audiovisual products? To answer this question, new theoretical predictions are derived from a trade model with heterogeneous firms and are confronted to audiovisual trade data.====The Helpman et al. (2008) framework is taken as the starting point as it conveniently describes bilateral trade flows as well as the absence of trade across many country pairs. In this setting, the heterogeneity across import bundles implies that the existence of a bilateral trade flow is not systematic and the composition of a country’s exports of a given product differs across destination markets. It is the characteristics of the importing country, in particular its income, that determine the profitability of foreign firms in the domestic market and therefore the selection of partners into imports. Relying on this mechanism, new predictions are derived about the relationship between per capita income and the geographical diversity of an imported good (measured at the intensive and the extensive margin).==== The theoretical predictions are applied to audiovisual trade data, which characteristics fit the model’s assumption: fixed cost matters and not all varieties produced by one country are exported (Ferreira and Waldfogel, 2013). The empirical test relies on data about bilateral trade flows of audiovisual products between 1998 and 2012 for a large sample of countries. It is the first study about audiovisual trade that combines data for both physical and digital sales, which is increasingly relevant in the context of the growing digitization of the sector.====The central results are as follows: income is positively correlated with the number of imports sources whilst there is an increasing concentration of imports on the most efficient partners. The predicted nonlinear impact of income on the extensive margin is also confirmed in the data and the empirical results reveal the existence of a non-monotonic relationship. Beyond some threshold, the number of import sources decreases which is explained theoretically by the fact that the level of substitution across varieties is greater than the capacity of origins to react to the opening of the destination market. These results are robust to a variety of robustness checks (excluding the crisis years, testing alternative datasets and incorporating variables about trade barriers). Furthermore, extended results are provided for the concentration phase that are in line with the predictions of the model: the already dominant partners are those who benefit the most from increasing purchasing power in the destination market. Other factors that could exacerbate the influence of income on the concentration of imports in the audiovisual sector are also discussed: the existence of an addictive process that has been emphasized in the literature as an important determinant of cultural good consumption, the potential influence of piracy, the strategy of conquest of emerging markets by the big players and the possible role of cultural protectionism.====The paper is organized as follows: the theoretical propositions are developed in Section 2. The data and the empirical strategy are presented in Section 3.

A crucial question to the fiscal policymakers is how corporate tax policies affect firm innovation, where innovation is widely accepted to be the driving force of the long-run economic growth (Romer, 1990, Grossman, Helpman, 1991, Aghion, Howitt, 1992). However, there is lack of micro evidence to establish a convincing causality between the above relationship, especially in case of the developing countries. Furthermore, firms’ heterogeneous responses to taxes and the underlying mechanisms behind the changes remain rarely unanswered.====The recent corporate income tax (CIT) reform in China provides an opportunity to evaluate whether a reduction in corporate income tax base encourages innovation and how this effect varies across firms. Since 1990s, the foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs)==== enjoyed a much lower CIT rate than the domestic firms. For the purpose of integrating the CIT system, the central government announced to double the wage deduction quota of the domestic firms from 800RMB per worker per month to 1600RMB within the year of 2006. It has been shown in the literature that an increase in after-tax internal funds provides R&D firms more incentive to innovate (Himmelberg, Petersen, 1994, Brown, Fazzari, Petersen, 2009). As a result, a reduction in corporate income tax base is expected to affect firm innovative activities.====Following the previous studies,==== we employ the count of patent filings to proxy for firm innovation. One thing worth mentioning is that only state/collective-controlled enterprises (SCCEs)==== undertake comparable R&D expenditure deduction policies to the FIEs during our sample period.==== Therefore, in this paper we adopt a difference-in-differences (DD) approach to exploit the 2006 CIT base reform as a natural experiment to examine how the SCCEs alter their innovative activities in response to a reduction in CIT base, compared to a control group of the FIEs which are supposed to be unaffected.==== As displayed in the box plots of Fig. 1, it is clear that the increase of the SCCEs was more rapid than that of the FIEs from 2003 to 2007, when considering invention patents and utility models separately.====Our main empirical results are striking. Lowering effective CIT by means of a reduction in tax base had a positive and significant effect on firm innovation. Specifically in the China case, this promotion effect was nontrivial and intermediate. Since the Chinese patent system classifies patents into differential types based on their technology complexity and novelty features. We also investigate the impacts on invention patents and utility models respectively, and derive similar results but with smaller magnitudes. It means, applications for design patents which contain the least technical content grew faster than the rest two. All these findings are robust to a series of sensitivity tests, including the validation of DD approach, alternative samples, and alternative econometric methodologies.====In the next part of the paper, we present a set of heterogeneity discussions. Our first empirical finding is that firms with larger sizes were more likely to improve their innovative performance since they were relieved more income taxes. Second, there was no significant difference in patent filings between firms in high-technology industries and non-high-technology industries after the 2006 CIT base reform. Finally, we find that firms in the eastern part of China contributed most of the growth in patent filings, especially to the invention patents. Meanwhile, firms in the non-eastern areas mainly made significant efforts in utility models.====After examining innovation in terms of patent quantity, we further explore the potential change in patent scope. We discover that the scope of invention patents were significantly improved subsequent to the 2006 CIT reform, and this effect concentrated in the enterprises located in the eastern provinces. Meanwhile, the scope of utility models were expanded in the non-eastern areas.====Last not but least, we study the specific channels through which tax policies affected firm innovation. We find that the recent patent surge in China not only resulted from an increment in R&D and capital investment, but also was likely to originate from purchasing existing technology at home and abroad, which was reflected as a rise in intangible intensity. We further see the financial constraint was loosened after the CIT base reform, which in turn encouraged innovation. Furthermore, firms’ new product sales were increased correspondingly, which is consistent with our expectation. Finally, we conduct a quick review on potential changes in firm productivity; however, it was irrelevant within the sample period. It might take time to convert innovation into a move up along the technology frontier.====Our paper contributes to a long branch of literature debating on tax incentives for innovation. Most of existing studies focus on how tax credits affect R&D investment e.g. (Hall, Van Reenen, 2000, Bloom, Griffith, Van Reenen, 2002, Sakakibara, Branstetter, 2001, Becker, 2015, Rao, 2016). Only a few recent papers study the effect from changes in corporate tax rates. To the best of our knowledge, the only two papers close to our story are Mukherjee et al. (2017) and Atanassov and Liu (2020). Our paper is different from them in several important dimensions. First, we study an exogenous national-wide reform which reduces CIT base rather than a state-level corporate tax rate cut. Our results show that a change in tax base is as efficient as a change in tax rate; moreover, the impact of the former is more intermediate than that of the later. Mukherjee et al. (2017) show that tax increase has a negative impact on innovation and tax decrease has no influence. Atanassov and Liu (2020) claim that tax decrease significantly improves the number of patents and the number of citations per patent, but this effect on average takes two or more years to be in effect. Second, we focus on an emerging market like China while previous studies are concentrated in developed countries. There was absence of convincing micro evidence from developing countries. Close to our paper, Howell (2016) investigates how a reduction in corporate tax burden via China’s 2004 provincial value-added tax reform affects firms’ R&D given various levels of financial constraints. Another recent paper by Chen et al. (2018b) also studies the fiscal policy on R&D investment in China, but it quantitatively evaluates the InnoCom program in 2008 which awards a lower average CIT to qualifying firms. Our paper in a quasi-experimental setup fills in the empirical gap to research on the effects on innovative output varying across firms.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description of the 2006 CIT base reform in China. Section 3 discusses the data sources, variable construction and the main empirical strategy.

Employing a large panel of Chinese manufacturing firms, combined with industry-specific exchange rates for the period 1998–2006, our system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation finds that uncertainty significantly encourages (discourages) investment for firms with high (low) labor share or low (high) investment irreversibility, and the impact is magnified for firms with low market power. Our paper demonstrates the importance of the share of variable input, investment irreversibility, and market power in the Hartman–Abel paradoxical effect that predicts a positive relationship between uncertainty and investment in the international economics context.","How does uncertainty affect investment? This question has long fascinated economists. Although conventional wisdom suggests that uncertainty should depress investment, no consensus has yet been reached among academics. Depending on the underlying assumptions on the degree of investment irreversibility, the level of market competition, and the share of variable input, the extant theories establish that the effect of uncertainty on investment can indeed be positive, negative, or indeterminate (Hartman, 1972, Abel, 1983, Dixit and Pindyck, 1994, Pindyck, 1988, Lee and Shin, 2000). However, most studies only find a negative effect of uncertainty on investment (Carruth et al., 2000), and little research has shown how the interplay of the theoretical elements shapes the relationship. To fill this void, we use industry-specific exchange rate volatility as a proxy for uncertainty and show that various uncertainty-investment relationships can emerge in different subsamples of manufacturing firms, as depicted by theories.====Early studies have identified two opposing effects of the uncertainty-investment relationship: the convexity effect and the option value effect. Given constant returns to scale and perfect competition, the ==== arises because a firm's marginal product of capital is a convex function of uncertainty about some underlying variables, such as price, quantity, or cost, and Jensen's inequality implies that greater uncertainty increases the marginal value of capital, thereby encouraging investment—that is, the Hartman–Abel effect (Hartman, 1972, Abel, 1983, Abel, 1985). The ==== is primarily derived from asymmetric adjustment costs. If adjusting investment downward is costlier than upward, to avoid making an irreversible investment in the wrong activities, a risk-neutral monopolistic firm may wait for the uncertainty to be resolved. As a result, uncertainty will depress current investment (Bernanke, 1983, Bertola, 1988, Pindyck, 1988).====To reconcile these two effects in a unified framework, the existing literature explores various assumptions that may render heterogeneous relationships between uncertainty and investment, among which market power and the share of variable inputs are shown to be the most relevant.==== More specifically, Caballero (1991) is the first to take into account both the positive Hartman-Abel effect and the negative option value effect in a unified model, using a markup coefficient to capture the degree of market power. He shows that under the assumption of a decreasing marginal return to capital due to imperfect competition, and in the case of sufficiently large asymmetric adjustment costs, the higher the market power of the firm (captured by the smaller absolute value of demand elasticity facing the firm), the more likely the investment is negatively related to uncertainty. The underlying intuitive mechanism is as follows: first, in an imperfectly competitive market, since the elasticity of demand is not perfectly elastic, a firm's desire to increase output is less than that under perfect competition since the increase in output will bring the price of its goods down, thereby lowering the direct effect of a positive change in price uncertainty. As a result, the convexity of the marginal profitability of capital with respect to price uncertainty (i.e., the convexity effect) is reduced (given the stock of capital). Second, in an imperfectly competitive market, due to the assumption of a decreasing marginal return to capital, the marginal value of investment is significantly affected by capital stock. An increase in current investment has a negative effect on the future profitability or value of future investment. Hence, the firm would have a motive to disinvest, which is the basis for the option value of waiting under irreversibility. Together, as the market power of a firm increases, the convexity effect weakens and the option value effect strengthens, and the former is dominated by the latter if the market power increases sufficiently, thereby generating the negative relationship between investment and uncertainty.====Supporting this view, Guisoand Paragi (1999) find that the negative effect of demand uncertainty on investment is stronger for firms with substantial market power. However, Campa and Goldberg (1995) and Kandilov and Leblebicioğlu (2011) suggest that the negative uncertainty-investment relationship is less sensitive for a firm with more market power. The underlying mechanism is that higher market power (as reflected by a higher markup) can partially insulate a firm's investment from exchange rate volatility by allowing the firm to absorb some of the fluctuations in its profit margin. The empirical studies of Campa and Goldberg (1995) and Kandilov and Leblebicioğlu (2011) also find that firms with higher market power experience smaller negative effects of exchange rate uncertainty. Hence, a consensus has not been reached concerning the impact of market power on the investment-uncertainty relationship.====Lee and Shin (2000) explore the role of the variable input labor in balancing between these two effects. By focusing on the variable input labor and introducing a (stock) fixed cost of adjustment to capture the option value effect, they demonstrate that under the constant returns to scale technology and perfect competition, when the labor share is small, the convexity effect is dominated by the option value effect, thereby rendering a negative relationship; when the labor share is sufficiently large, the convexity effect dominates the option value effect, thereby producing a positive relationship. The underlying mechanism is as follows: labor is a variable input that can be adjusted flexibly, and an increase in the labor share of production convexifies the profit function and increases the elasticity of investment with respect to uncertainty, which in turn strengthens the positive convexity effect. Therefore, when the labor share is sufficiently large, the convexity effect becomes so large that it dominates the option value effect, producing a positive relationship.====In short, the existing theoretical literature illustrates how the sign of the investment-uncertainty relationship depends on the interplay between market power and investment irreversibility, or the interplay between the share of variable input and investment irreversibility.====Empirical studies have examined the investment-uncertainty relationship for various sources of uncertainty and at different levels of data aggregation.==== Regarding the effect of exchange rate uncertainty on investment, using country-level data, Servén (2003) shows that exchange rate uncertainty reduces investment in 61 developing countries, while Darby et al. (1999) report similar findings for five developed countries. Using industry-level data, Goldberg (1993) and Campa and Goldberg (1995) find the effect of exchange rate variability on investment to be small and insignificant in U.S. industries.====The estimated relationship between exchange rate uncertainty and investment at the aggregate level can be spurious (Leahy and Whited, 1996, Guiso and Parigi, 1999, Lee and Shin, 2000, Bontempi et al., 2010). First, macro-level data are in general inappropriate for testing theories that are developed for the profit-maximizing firm. Second, certain shocks are industry-specific or firm-specific and aggregate data fail to capture heterogeneous effects. Even a common source of shocks can affect different firms in different ways. For example, a shock to exchange rates can affect an import-oriented firm differently from an export-oriented firm. Third, as discussed above, existing theories predict that the effect of uncertainty on investment depends on various firm characteristics. While studies using aggregate data are unable to address these issues, firm-level data can provide deeper insight.====Using firm-level data, several studies find a negative exchange rate uncertainty-investment relationship for Italian firms, Chilean firms, and Colombian manufacturing plants, respectively (see Nucci and Pozzolo, 2001, Fuentes, 2006, Kandilov and Leblebicioğlu, 2011). All of these studies have explored how the interactions between certain theoretical factors (e.g., market power and investment irreversibility) shape this relationship. However, how the sign of the investment-uncertainty relationship is affected by the interplay of investment irreversibility, the share of variable input, and market power still remains an open question, both theoretically and empirically.====Empirically, it is difficult to precisely capture or even demonstrate the importance of these elements in shaping the effect of uncertainty on investment, mainly because the share of variable input and the degree of investment irreversibility are unobservable. If we construct proxies for these factors and build up a model with interaction terms to estimate their roles, we confront a problem of generated regressor errors. Alternatively, we can estimate the effects in subsamples with different combinations of the share of variable input, investment irreversibility, and market power. Gathering an appropriate sample to address this issue presents a critical challenge. The sample must offer rich heterogeneity in the key elements and must be large enough for researchers to be able to draw reliable inferences from the subsamples.====This paper investigates how industry-level exchange rate variability impacts firm-level investment by employing a large panel dataset of Chinese manufacturing firms in order to shed light on the importance of various theoretical elements in shaping the relationship between exchange rate uncertainty and investment. As the largest developing country and the second largest economy in the world, China is one of the most important trading partners for many countries. For example, in 2016, the European Commission declared China to be the European Union's second largest trading partner behind the United States and the EU to be China's largest trading partner. Our data are obtained from the Chinese Annual Industrial Companies Database and covers the ==== of China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and all the large- and medium-sized non-SOE firms in the manufacturing sector. Our sample also spans the entire spectrum of theoretical elements, which allows us to draw conclusions that are more reliable by comparing the results from different subsamples. Thus, our dataset provides a better laboratory in which to study the issue than the Chilean example in Fuentes (2006) and the Columbian example in Kandilov and Leblebicioğlu (2011).====We find significant heterogeneous effects of exchange rate uncertainty on investment across the firm groups, as depicted by the theories. Specifically, consistent with partial equilibrium models with investment irreversibility, such as those of Lee and Shin (2000) and Kandilov and Leblebicioğlu (2011), we find that exchange rate volatility encourages investment (1) for firms with a high share of labor input; (2) for firms with a low level of investment irreversibility; and (3) for firms with low market power. More importantly, we find that the interplay of the three factors reinforce the empirical relationship between exchange rate uncertainty and investment, as depicted in the existing theoretical models. We find the strongest positive effect for firms with a high labor share, a low degree of investment irreversibility, and low market power, and the strongest negative effect for firms with a low labor share, a high degree of investment irreversibility, and high market power. However, the relationship is indeterminate in the cases where the convexity effect and the option value effect may offset each other.====Our paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, we explicitly examine the role of labor share in the investment-uncertainty relationship at the firm level. Whereas most empirical studies fail to find a positive relationship, we show that the share of variable input significantly affects the relationship in a way that is consistent with theoretical predictions (Lee and Shin, 2000), namely that uncertainty increases (decreases) investment for firms with a high (low) degree of labor share. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the relative importance of the share of variable input, investment irreversibility, and firm market power in determining the effect of exchange rate uncertainty on investment. The interplay of these three characteristics can indeed produce positive, negative, or indeterminate effects. Taken together, our study emphasizes the importance of the share of variable input, investment irreversibility, and market power in the Hartman–Abel paradoxical effect that predicts a positive relationship between uncertainty and investment in the international economics context.====As developed countries have a relatively low labor share in production in comparison to developing countries, our findings in part explain why existing studies using U.S. and European firm-level data primarily find a negative investment-uncertainty relationship. Furthermore, our results provide a plausible justification for why a more flexible exchange rate system may likely enhance economic growth for developing economies, but not for developed economies (Levy-Yeyati and Sturzengger, 2003).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model specification. Section 3 describes the Chinese firm-level data and discusses the estimation of industry-specific exchange rates and exchange rate volatility.

We find: (i) robust and significant effects of product drop, with the effect coming only from competitive pressure in the domestic market; (ii) robust evidence of product drop or ‘creative destruction’ only for firms belonging to the lower-half of the size distribution; (iii) firms drop their peripheral/marginal products and concentrate on the core ones; and (iv) the result is strongest for firms producing ","China’s export performance post-1990, and more so since 2001 (with entry to the WTO), has been nothing short of spectacular! Its exports grew from US$ 62 billion to US$ 1.2 trillion between 1990 and 2007====; an average of around 20% per year (Iacovone et al., 2013). In the same period, China’s share of GDP more than doubled, from 15.9 to 34.9%. In terms of the sectoral composition, manufacturing exports accounted for 89% of total merchandise exports between 2000 and 2005.==== On the back of this very strong export performance, China became the world’s largest exporter in 2009, and the second largest economy in 2010 (Iacovone et al., 2013).==== Naturally, this meteoric rise of China to the status of a global exporting giant, particularly in terms of manufactured goods, has induced economists to understand the effects of import competition from low-wage countries, specifically China, on various firm- and industry-level outcomes of developed countries (Bernard, Jensen, Schott, 2006, Liu, 2010, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Mion, Zhu, 2013, Martin, Meajean, 2014, Bloom, Draca, Van Reenen, 2016), and to a far lesser extent for developing countries (see for example, Iacavone et al., 2013 and Utar and Ruiz, 2013 for Mexico and Medina, 2017 for Peru).====Our study adds to this relatively small (but growing) literature by exploring the causal effects of Chinese import competition on developing countries. In particular, we attempt to understand what happens to product mix/scope in India, a large developing country, when it faces competition from another equally large developing country, China. We find that an increase in the import share from China forces Indian manufacturing firms, more so for small and medium-sized firms (lower half of the size distribution) with no effect for big firms, to drop their peripheral products while concentrating on the core ones. Our results also show that the effect is strongest for firms producing intermediate inputs.====Our primary motivation to study the effects of Chinese import competition on the product variety of Indian (manufacturing) firms comes from the following reasons: (i) a recently released research document from the Office of the Economic Advisor, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India highlights a significant surge in the growth in the share of imports from China, especially in the post-WTO membership (of China) period. The study uses 268 items for the period of 2004-05 to 2010-11 to find that while the import index (for these 268 items) from all countries grew by 1773.1%, in case of imports from China, the index increased by 4618.4% over the same period. Additionally, the share of imports of these 268 items from China in total imports jumped to 41.3% in 2010-11 from 25.3% in 2005-06 (Singh, 2012).====Figure 1 shows a monotonically upward trend in the share of India’s manufacturing imports from China in total manufacturing imports. This share rises by approximately 15 percentage points from roughly 1% of total imports in 1992 to almost 16% in 2007 (this figure increases further to around 26% in 2017). Particularly striking is the dramatic increase in the import share in the post-2001 period i.e., following China’s accession to the WTO in December, 2001. Between 1992 and 2001, China’s share of Indian imports grew from 1% to around 5.5%, which shot to 16% between 2002-2007; an increase of 10.5 percentage points over a shorter period relative to the pre-2001 period (where the increase was 4.5 percentage points).====Table 1 documents India’s trade (both exports and imports) with China and imports from other major regions of the world, including total imports, at three different periods of time: 1992, 2001 and 2007. It shows that China accounted for the largest increase in India’s imports relative to the other countries and major regions of the world. India’s share of Chinese imports grew by around 9000% between 1992 and 2007.==== In comparison, imports from ASEAN (one of the biggest trading partners of India), the US and EU increased by 888%, 230% and 132%, respectively. Compared to Mexico====, where the Chinese share of manufacturing imports increased by a factor of 8, in the case of India it increased by a factor greater than 90 over the same time period (1992–2007).====With respect to India’s exports to China, there has also been a significant increase but the rate of increase is far lower than the increase in import flows from China; the increase in exports is close to one-third to that of imports. In the process, China became the largest trading partner of India with a total trade of US$ 84.44 billion in 2014-15. India’s trade deficit with China also ballooned nine-fold over the past decade to US$ 52.7 billion in 2015-16 (Export-Import Bank of India, 2016).==== Following Iacovone et al. (2013), where the authors argue about the immediate effect of the rise of China on middle-income countries, the effect on the performance of Indian manufacturing firms seems to be of the first order importance. This brings us to our second motivation.====(ii) An online campaign against the Chinese goods started after the national secretary of the current ruling political party (Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP, which came to power in 2014) called for a boycott of the Chinese products in 2014. The online campaign against Chinese goods got further attention as reports started to show that this increase in Chinese imports may hurt India’s factories on the background of the ‘Make in India’ campaign launched by the current Prime Minister of India.==== The reports also show that cheap imports from China has been a problem area for small Indian businesses.==== The Commerce Minister of India also raised the issue of cheap Chinese goods flooding the Indian market, hurting its traders and manufacturing sectors on her visit to China (after the current ruling party came to power in May 2014).==== She mentioned that imports of textile machinery (an intermediate good) from China are among the biggest threats to small manufacturers.====Given this as our background, China being currently the biggest trading partner of India and anecdotal evidence of Chinese products hurting the Indian manufacturers, we are interested to know the nature of the response (if any) from Indian manufacturing firms. Whereas trade theory identifies low-wage countries as a likely source of disruption to high-wage countries’ manufacturing firms, Krugman (2008) points out that free trade with countries of any income level may affect the dynamics of the domestic market. On the other hand, a large body of empirical evidence demonstrates that import competition, especially from China, significantly affects dynamics of manufacturing firms; the lion’s share (of these studies) concentrating on developed countries. Our focus is slightly different in the sense that we investigate the effect (of the rise in Chinese imports) on product variety of Indian firms. In other words, what happens to product mix of manufacturing firms, when there is a significant rise in South-South trade? Do we get same kind of evidence? For example, did the increase in competition from China cause Indian firms to rationalize their product mix by focusing on their core products and drop the peripheral ones? This is the first contribution of our paper.====Next, our aim is to establish a causal link between increase in imports from China and product scope of Indian firms. To understand such, we follow the literature on the rise of Chinese imports and its effect on labour markets in developed countries (Autor et al., 2013), and use one of the most important episodes of world trade in the last two decades: China’s membership to the WTO in 2001 as a suitable quasi-natural experiment to investigate how does China’s unilateral trade liberalization policies cause Indian firms to alter their product mix.==== The growth in Chinese exports to India as a result of accession to the WTO that we examine is a result of China’s internal reforms to a market-oriented economy. This transition to a market (from central planning) economy resulted in significant productivity growth for Chinese firms, which got further bolstered due to reduction in trade costs as a result of its accession to the WTO. We treat this as a unilateral trade shock and not a mutual trade expansion. All the existing empirical studies, which investigates the effect of Chinese imports on product scope of firms, focus only on the yearly change in Chinese imports.==== We use 2001 as the structural break to compare the product space of Indian firms between 1992-2001 and 2002-2007 through a Bartik-type estimation method. Nonetheless, following the literature we also exploit the yearly change in the share of Chinese imports as our preferred specification when using the IV method to get more economically meaningful estimates.==== This is the second contribution of our paper.====However, this approach also requires the fact that the import demand shocks in India, especially after 2001 are not the primary cause of China’s export surge. While it seems plausible that China’s export growth to India during the 2000s is a result of China’s internal supply shocks, using accession to the WTO to estimate a difference-in-difference model (comparing the imports before and after 2001) will help us estimate the precise effects by taking care of the unobserved factors. We also adopt an alternative estimation strategy where we use Chinese imports to European countries as an instrument for Chinese imports to India. All approaches yield similar results.====Lastly, India and China are two of the more economically successful BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries and their interactions in the sphere of international trade and the outcomes are, in our view, worthy of an enquiry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of import competition on firm performance in relation to two BRICS countries.====We provide a careful investigation of the causal impact of Chinese competition focusing on the extensive margin of Indian firms, using detailed firm-product-level data. Likewise domestic market, we recognize that Indian firms facing Chinese competition is likely to feel the same threat in one of its main export market, the US.==== We, therefore, evaluate these causal links by not only looking at the threat in the domestic or home market but also for the US. To do so, we use China’s WTO accession in 2001 as the quasi-natural experiment and differential increase in competitive pressure of Chinese imports across manufacturing industries to implement a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. In particular, we exploit the average share of Chinese imports across each 4-digit industry (in both India and the US) in the pre-WTO accession period (between 1992 and 2001) and then interact it with a WTO accession dummy (it takes a value 1 if year is greater than or equal to 2002).==== This interaction term captures the differential effect of Chinese competition on firms according to their trade exposure from China prior to 2001.====We find strong heterogeneous effects of Chinese competitive shock on the extensive (product drop or exit) margin. In particular, we find robust evidence of product drop or ‘creative destruction’ for firms belonging to the lower-half of the size distribution (1st and 2nd quartile), i.e., small and medium-sized firms. All these effects are strictly concentrated due to competitive pressure of Chinese imports in the home and not export market. Our coefficients indicate that a 10 percentage point increase in India’s Chinese share of imports reduces the product scope of manufacturing firms by 1.7–4.4% at the mean. Our results also provide significant evidence of product reallocation within firms as competition obliges them to focus on their core competencies; a finding consistent with the ‘core-competency’ hypothesis of the multi-product firms (Eckel and Neary, 2010). Relatedly, we find that focusing on core-product(s) help firms to upgrade their productivity (Mayer et al., 2014) and within-firm reallocation of other productive factors. The effect of ‘creative destruction’ in response to Chinese imports is acute in case of (i) both exporters and non-exporters, and (ii) only domestic firms. Our results remain unchanged with instrumental variable (IV) analysis. On the other hand, we find significant positive effects of Chinese competition (at the domestic market), when we look at import of intermediate goods rather than total imports.====Our paper contributes to a vibrant literature that links how import competition affects product scope of firms. Results show (i) that firms alter their product mix by dropping their peripheral products or products with high marginal costs (Baldwin, Gu, 2009, Liu, 2010, Bernard, Redding, Schott, 2011, Iacovone, Rauch, Winters, 2013), and (ii) there is substantial heterogeneity in product scope adjustment – firms above a cut-off of size distribution expand product scope, whereas other reduce it (Dhingra, 2013, Qiu, Zhou, 2013, Lopresti, 2016). Within this literature, our paper is most closely related to Iacovone et al. (2013), which investigates the effect of Chinese import competition (for both domestic and export market) on product mix of Mexican firms. While we focus on Chinese import competition and product mix of Indian manufacturing firms, our paper differs from Iacovone et al. (2013) along several other dimensions.====First, methodologically. While they use only yearly changes in Chinese imports (treating emergence of China onto world markets as a quasi-natural experiment), our focus is on the difference between imports before and after 2001 (treating China’s accession to the WTO as a quasi-natural). Second, while we focus on the effect of competitive pressure from both domestic and foreign market by putting them together (in all estimations), they estimate the effects separately.==== Third, our results based on quartile regressions (both OLS and IV) clearly show that it is the firms from the lower-half of the size distribution who drop their peripheral products in response to Chinese competition at the domestic market, whereas their quantile regressions are only focuses on intensive (plant sales) and not on extensive margin (neither on product exit nor core products). Fourth, the context of the rise in India-China trade is significantly different from Mexico-China. The former ones are two of the fastest growing economies of the world and China is currently the largest trading partner of India. Chinese imports in India increased more than 10 times higher than that of Mexico, especially after 2001.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review and discuss both theoretical and empirical literature related to our paper in Section 2. Section 3 describes the datasets we use in the paper, together with some preliminary analyses. We investigate the direct impact of Chinese import competition, in both domestic and export markets, on the product variety of Indian manufacturing firms in Section 4. Section 5 digs deeper to understand the mechanism behind the effect by focusing on core competency, product-sales composition and product exit. We look at within-firm responses by looking at productivity effects, productive factors and sales (intensive margin) in Section 6. We divide the sample of firms according to product, industry and firm characteristics to investigate further heterogeneity in our results in Section 7.

We provide evidence that the relationship follows a strong temporal pattern. Former British colonies were considerably more democratic than other countries immediately following independence, but subsequent democratic convergence has largely eliminated these differences in the post-Cold War period. Existing theories expounding superior British culture or alternative colonial institutions cannot account for divergent inheritances and diminishing legacies. To explain the time-varying pattern, we analyze European powers’ varying policy approaches to ==== as well as changes in the international system. Britain more consistently treated competitive democratic elections as a prerequisite for gaining independence, leading to higher initial democracy levels. However, nascent democracies that lacked deep-rooted societal transformation faced challenges to democratic consolidation because of Cold War superpower competition. Later shifts in the international system toward promoting democracy further contributed to convergence by destabilizing colonially rooted dictatorships.","How did colonial rule affect post-independence political outcomes? Amid the enormous social science and historical literatures on colonialism, scholars devote considerable attention to assessing the relationship between British colonialism and democracy.==== Existing research is inconclusive. Many scholars expound pro-democratic legacies: British governance promoted the rule of law and better acquainted subjects with the norms of democratic procedures (Emerson, 1960, Weiner, 1987, Ferguson, 2012). Scholars also routinely control for a British colonial rule dummy in cross-national democracy regressions. However, statistical findings vary: some find strong evidence for a Britain effect (Bernhard, Reenock, Nordstrom, 2004, Olsson, 2009), whereas others do not (Barro, 1999, Przeworski, Alvarez, Cheibub, Limongi, 2000, Miller, 2015). Furthermore, recent political science research on colonialism and democracy mainly looks “beyond national colonial legacies” (Owolabi, 2014) and instead focuses on alternative historical legacies such as Protestant missionaries, forced migration, and European settlers—often explicitly de-emphasizing the importance of British colonialism. Research on economic development features a similar debate, with support for the importance of colonizer identity (La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, Shleifer, Vishny, 1998, Grier, 1999, Fails, Krieckhaus, 2010, Lee, Schultz, 2012) countered by arguments that other aspects of colonial rule were more important (Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001, Kohli, 2004, Engerman, Sokoloff, 2011, Iyer, 2010).====This article establishes a specific mixed legacy of British colonialism on democracy, and demonstrates that the Britain effect cannot be convincingly explained without examining change over time. We document that although British colonial rule bequeathed a large and statistically distinguishable democratic inheritance at independence, this legacy diminished afterwards. In countries’ first full year of independence, the average difference in democracy levels exceeds 30% of the range of the standard Polity scale. In fact, nearly every country that attained high Polity scores at independence during the Second Wave of democracy experienced British colonial rule.==== However, ex-British colonies do not significantly differ from non-former British colonies in democracy levels since 1991.====We propose a two-part explanation for this pattern. First, policy differences across empires during the post-1945 decolonization era contributed to British colonies’ advantages at independence. Focusing on decolonization builds off a smaller strand of the existing historical and social science literatures (Smith, 1978, Kahler, 1984, Spruyt, 2005, Pepinsky, 2015) and contrasts with many prominent political science theories focused on long-term cultural or institutional factors that cannot explain change over time. After 1945, Britain—the most democratic metropole among major colonies and confronted with a relatively weak colonial lobby—facilitated transitions to independence more tailored to individual countries’ democratic development compared to other major colonial powers, and also avoided the successful anti-colonial revolutions that ended European rule in many other colonies.====Second, changes in the international system correspond with diminishing legacies. Colonies in our core sample gained independence amid Cold War competition that undermined Western incentives to promote democracy. Given these poor international conditions, newly independent states that possessed democratic institutions but experienced minimal societal transformation during colonialism—such as many British colonies—should suffer reversals. However, several decades later, the Third Wave democratization forces that began during the Cold War and accelerated afterwards created more favorable international conditions for Western democracy promotion. Destabilizing colonially rooted dictatorships made democratization, or at least movement toward greater levels of electoral competition, possible in all ex-colonies—even those lacking prior democratic experience.====Numerous statistical tests demonstrate the existence and robustness of the core pattern of divergent inheritances and diminished legacies for British colonialism and democracy. Cross-sectional models estimate a moderately large positive association between British rule and democracy among all post-independence years for countries that gained independence after 1945. The correlation is quite large at independence and robustly statistically significant, and only a large amount of bias from unobserved covariates could explain away the estimated effect. However, the coefficient estimate is considerably smaller and not consistently significant in a post-1991 sample. These findings are similar when accounting for alternative democratization accounts such as modernization theory or the resource curse, when changing democracy measures, and when expanding the sample to include all non-European countries using data since 1800.====These findings are inconsistent with existing explanations for the British colonialism-democracy effect. Some emphasize long-term cultural and institutional factors, and therefore cannot explain convergence over time nor why many ex-British colonies suffered democratic reversals shortly after independence. Others emphasize the importance of diversity within the British empire, whereas we show that the estimates are similar across many varieties of British rule, including short and indirectly ruled colonies exhibiting a democratic advantage at independence relative to non-British colonies. Finally, others argue that alternative aspects of the colonial era such as European settlers or Protestant missionaries can explain away the Britain effect. We show that the estimates at independence are similar when controlling for these factors, which themselves receive circumscribed support in our regressions.====Additional statistical evidence more directly supports our posited mechanisms. Regarding democracy promotion before independence, Britain indeed facilitated more competitive elections prior to granting independence, evidenced across various pre-colonial democracy components. However, demonstrating the importance specifically of the post-1945 decolonization period, British colonies would not have exhibited their democratic advantage at independence had, counterfactually, they gained independence even several years before they factually did. Britain also avoided the successful anti-colonial revolutions that ended European rule in many other colonies, which correlates with democracy levels at independence, as do mechanisms that help to explain differences in Britain’s post-1945 decolonization strategy relative to other European powers: metropolitan democracy level and colonial lobby strength. After independence, evidence from time series regressions demonstrate patterns of both (1) democratic reversals shortly after independence in ex-British colonies and (2) greater democratic gains by non-former British colonies several decades after independence. Although Third Wave forces should conceivably have helped British colonies as well, we show that differential trends at the end of the Cold War—which largely washed out the initial British colonial advantage—likely arose because the British colonies most likely to benefit from Third Wave forces had already achieved high democracy scores, creating ceiling effects. Furthermore, the decolonization factors that correlate with democracy levels at independence do not correlate with post-1991 democracy levels.====Most directly, the theory and findings provide a more nuanced perspective on how British colonialism affected democracy. Both British colonialism and other historical factors mentioned in the literature (such as European settlers and Protestant missionaries) only affected democracy levels in the short term, due to the importance of decolonization and changes in the international system. This pattern contrasts with studies of economic development, which tend to show persistence of income or other development differences over centuries or millennia. However, our findings are potentially important for research on path dependence in economic development. Given evidence that democracy may contribute to economic growth (Acemoglu et al., 2019), the inability of ex-British colonies to consolidate democracy helps to account for their inability to significantly improve their aggregate economic performance after independence relative to the colonial era (Lee and Paine, 2019) and, consequently, to close large income gaps with Europe (Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001, Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2002).

Although this issue has been widely discussed, it has rarely been tested empirically. This research presents new ==== evidence on the behavior of WMFs, highlighting the differences within the firm between members and nonmembers. I use a comprehensive linked employee-employer panel data set of workers registered in Uruguay's social security records from 1996 to 2013. The resulting evidence shows that WMFs hire an increasing share of employees. However, the share of employees that the PC chose to hire does not seem to have been effected by variations in the level of success of PCs, suggesting that Uruguayan WMFs do not exhibit this type of degeneration process.","This article examines whether a firm structured differently than prevailing firms in contemporary market economies can survive and grow. Market economies are dominated by conventional firms (CFs), which are controlled by their capital suppliers, and most institutions (not necessarily capitalist) have largely adapted to interact with CFs, helping to promote their development. It is therefore interesting to study not only the possibilities for survival of a different type of organization, but also whether they can survive while maintaining the differential characteristics that define them.====To analyze this issue, I consider the case of worker-managed firms (WMFs), in which workers have the ultimate control over economic decisions (Dow, 2003) and equal influence on those decisions regardless of their individual capital contributions (one person, one vote). This type of firm has attracted the attention of renowned economists from Karl Marx to Leon Walras and Alfred Marshall, and in the second half of the twentieth century, a vast body of literature has attempted to explain its behavior and its relative rarity among firms.====Since the time of John Stuart Mill,==== WMFs’ difficulties in extending property rights to new members have been one of the proposed explanations for the low incidence of WMFs. This emphasis considers not the circumstances in which this type of firm can fail and close, but instead the processes through which WMFs, as a result of their own success, change and degenerate until they do not differ from CFs. The intuitive idea underlying the concept of WMF degeneration is similar to that underlying any organization's demise: the WMF can disappear by being dissolved, or it can be transformed into another type of organization.====Generally, a firm's transformation into a different type of firm is not seen as a failure. After all, a variety of business types coexist in capitalist market economies. Yet the word “degeneration,” which is widely used in the economic literature on WMFs, has a strong ideological connotation because WMFs have been proposed as a more egalitarian organizational form than CFs. Therefore, a WMF's transformation into a capitalist enterprise is seen as a failure, albeit one that might involve increased earnings and personal wealth for owners.====Because all workers have control rights in the theoretical definition of WMFs, the hiring of salaried employees represents a deviation from the definition of a WMF.==== To contribute to the study of this subject, I analyze the effect of the success of the WMF on the firms’ hiring of wage labor, and I contribute to the empirical debate on the causes that lead a firm to be located somewhere on the spectrum between the pure models of a CF and a WMF. This emphasis on analyzing the determinants of hiring wage labor is justified by the fact that, in addition to substantially deviating from the theoretical model of WMF, this phenomenon is easily observable. According to some pessimistic hypothesis all successful WMFs will become a CF. However, these hypotheses have never been empirically tested. The main contribution of this article is being the first one to do so by performing an econometric analysis of the effects of the success of the firm on WMFs’ share of employees.====To perform this analysis, I use a comprehensive linked employee-employer panel data set of workers registered in Uruguay's social security records from 1996 to 2013. With these data, I estimate how WMFs’ hiring of wage labor is affected by the success of the firm and by two other determinants mentioned in the literature review (the firm's size, and the heterogeneity of its members).====The remainder of the article is organized as follows.

I use an epidemiological approach involving second-generation migrants to test for a possible cultural gradient in individuals’ propensity towards human capital accumulation. Results indicate a strong relationship between country-of-origin culture and human capital accumulation and are robust to using years of education instead of individuals’ engagement in human capital accumulation as the dependent variable. Drawing on dimensions of cultural differences identified in culture frameworks developed by cross-cultural researchers, results further suggest that cultural emphasis on intellectual autonomy helps explain part of the observed differences in human capital accumulation. However, further work is needed to complete our understanding of the cultural roots of individuals’ propensity towards human capital accumulation.","Human capital accumulation is an important source of economic growth and development (Barro, 1991, Erosa et al., 2010, Gennaioli et al., 2013, Mankiw et al., 1992, Manuelli and Seshadri, 2014); however, human capital accumulation itself is a factor requiring further explanation (Lucas, 1993). In fact, some authors view capital accumulation or education as manifestations of growth rather than as causal determinants of growth; “they are growth” (North and Thomas, 1973, p.2).====In an influential paper, Acemoglu et al. (2001) propose that the nature of the formal institutions in a country, specifically whether institutions are extractive or inclusive, is critical for development. They test this argument using data on settler mortality, finding that European colonizers designed institutions aimed at extracting value rather than creating value in environments in which their chances of survival were lower. Other work is more critical of the role of formal institutions, suggesting that human capital is a more basic source of growth than formal institutions are (Glaeser et al., 2004). Particularly, the argument is that European colonizers did not bring with them institutions as much as they brought human capital—and more of this human capital settled permanently in places more hospitable to Europeans, i.e., in places with lower settler mortality. Other work still identifies informal institutions such as culture and certain societal norms as fundamental drivers of economic development (see Nunn, 2012, Roland, 2015, and Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2013 for surveys; also see Fukuyama, 1995 and Landes, 1998). Meanwhile, the challenge put forth by Lucas (1993) and North and Thomas (1973) of studying human capital as an ==== rather than an ==== remains largely unaddressed.====This paper takes up this challenge, extending the culture-development literature to study the role of culture as a deep factor underlying individuals’ propensity towards human capital accumulation. A straightforward definition of culture is as values, beliefs, practices and norms that are shared by members of a group and are transmitted fairly unchanged from generation to generation (Guiso et al., 2006, Javidan et al., 2006). Standard human capital theory (Becker, 1964, Mincer, 1958) finds that the expected rate of return on investment and people's preferences (particularly their level of impatience) together determine how much human capital an individual accumulates. Some studies provide empirical support for this insight, finding that both individuals’ level of impatience (Cadena and Keys, 2015) and their life expectancy (Oster et al., 2013)—a proxy for return on investment—affect individual differences in human capital. Cross-country differences in human capital have been similarly related to differences in life expectancy but also to differences in access to public education (Córdoba and Ripoll, 2013). Studies of the economic consequences of culture commonly focus on the effect of cooperative norms or social trust on the level of GDP per capita and a variety of other societal structures and outcomes (Algan and Cahuc, 2010, Knack and Keefer, 1997). However, there is also a growing number of studies that relates specific dimensions of cultural differences between countries to various economic phenomena (Bloom et al., 2012, Davis and Abdurazokzoda, 2016, Davis and Williamson, 2016, Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2011, Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2017, Klasing, 2013, Van Hoorn, 2014). Finally, there is some work at the intersection of cross-country education and culture research. Hofstede (2001) and Minkov (2007), for instance, find that future orientation of a culture affects academic achievement (see, also, Hofstede and Minkov, 2010). Related research finds that dimensions of culture predict differences in classroom behavior and learning practices (e.g., Cortazzi and Jin, 2013). My concern is not with such educational phenomena, however, but with culture as a factor explaining the accumulation of human capital (cf. Lucas, 1993). The main hypothesis that I test in this paper is that ====.====To test this hypothesis I follow earlier culture research (Atkin, 2016, Fernández and Fogli, 2006) and apply an epidemiological approach involving data on second-generation migrants from different countries of origin that at present live in various destination countries. Using data that combine different economic, institutional and cultural environments, it is possible to distil an effect of cultural background on individuals’ propensity towards human capital accumulation that is unbiased by economic and other institutional conditions that might correlate with culture and cause biases. Underlying the epidemiological approach is the idea that culture continues to have an effect on migrants’ behavior because culture is persistent, as per the large literature on cultural inertia and intergenerational transmission of values and practices (Bisin and Verdier, 2001, Grosfeld and Zhuravskaya, 2015, Voigtländer and Voth, 2012).====Results for a sample of about 3600 second-generation migrants reveal a strong relationship between country-of-origin culture and individuals’ engagement in human capital accumulation. Moreover, I find the same relationship between country-of-origin culture and human capital accumulation when considering individuals’ years of education instead of engagement in human capital accumulation as the dependent variable. In addition, differences in cultural emphasis on intellectual autonomy appear particularly important for understanding country differences in the accumulation of human capital. The paper thus finds robust empirical support for a role of culture in cross-country differences in human capital accumulation, confirming the tenor of Lucas’ (1993) plea to consider education as a proximate rather than an ultimate cause of economic development.====This paper's key contribution is to add a significant explanatory factor to the literature seeking to understand countries’ differential experiences in accumulating human capital. In addition, the paper contributes to the identification of specific dimensions of culture—as identified by cross-cultural researchers—that help explain why some countries have a much stronger tendency to accumulate human capital than other countries do.",Cultural determinants of human capital accumulation: Evidence from the European Social Survey,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596719300228,2 February 2019,2019,Research Article,240.0

Whereas existing attempts to deal with the ”missing poor” problem assume the absence of income mobility and assign to the prematurely dead a fictitious income equal to the last income enjoyed, this paper relaxes that assumption in order to study the impact of income mobility on the size of the missing poor bias. We use data on poverty above age 60 in 12 countries from the EU-SILC database, and we compare standard poverty rates with the hypothetical poverty rates that would have prevailed if (i) all individuals, whatever their income, had enjoyed the same survival conditions, and if (ii) all individuals within the same income class had been subject to the same income mobility process. Taking income mobility into account has unequal effects on corrected poverty measures across countries, and, hence, affects international comparisons in terms of old-age poverty.","Despite the rise of the modern Welfare State, our economies can be regarded, at the beginning of the 21st century, as Malthusian economies, in the sense that poor individuals still face nowadays higher mortality rates than non-poor persons, in line with the ”positive population check” phenomenon underlined by Malthus (1798). Although the extent of overmortality of the poor has been reduced since Malthus’s epoch, empirical studies show that there exists nowadays an increasing non linear relationship between income and life expectancy.====As this was stressed by Kanbur and Mukherjee (2007), the positive correlation between income and life expectancy prevents standard measures of poverty from quantifying the actual extent of old-age poverty. The intuition behind this measurement problem is simple: poor persons face higher mortality rates than non-poor persons, which implies that, when measuring old-age poverty by means of standard indicators (focusing only on the surviving population), the poor are under-represented with respect to the non-poor. This phenomenon can be coined the ”missing poor” problem, in line with Sen’s (1998) ”missing women” problem.====In order to correct for the missing poor problem, Kanbur and Mukherjee (2007) proposed to assign, to the prematurely dead poor persons, a fictitious income, and to compute hypothetical poverty rates under the hypothetical income distribution. Alternatively, Lefebvre et al. (2013) proposed to assign to all prematurely dead persons (poor and non-poor) a fictitious income, and to compute poverty rates on that new hypothetical income distribution.====Under those two approaches, the fictitious income assigned to the prematurely dead consists of the last income that the individual enjoyed before dying. This assignment procedure constitutes a good proxy in an economy where there is little or no income mobility. However, in economies with sizeable income mobility, taking the last income as a proxy of the income level that would have been enjoyed in case of survival constitutes a stronger assumption.====The goal of this paper is precisely to reexamine the missing poor problem for poverty measurement while taking income mobility into account. For that purpose, we propose to compare standard old-age poverty measures with corrected old-age poverty measures that assign to prematurely dead individuals not the last income enjoyed before dying, but the income that ==== in case of survival given the prevailing income mobility process.====Our motivation for studying the effect of income mobility on the missing poor problem goes as follows. Actually, if there is a strong upward income mobility, assigning to the prematurely dead a fictitious income equal to the last income enjoyed would lead to overestimate the number of missing poor, since we would then count as poor individuals who died prematurely and would not have been poor in case of survival. As a consequence, corrected poverty measures would then overestimate the actual extent of old-age poverty.==== One can thus expect that income mobility matters when incorporating the prematurely dead in poverty measures. An important issue is to know the precise extent to which income mobility matters empirically for the correction of poverty measures.====In order to examine the impact of income mobility on the missing poor problem, this paper uses data on poverty above age 60 in 12 countries from the EU-SILC database.==== We first compare standard old-age poverty rates with the hypothetical old-age poverty rates that would have prevailed if (i) all individuals, whatever their income, had enjoyed the same survival conditions, and if (ii) all individuals within the same income class had been subject to the same income mobility process. Assumption (ii) amounts to assign to prematurely dead persons a fictitious income equal to the one that would have been enjoyed in case of survival, given the income mobility process (conditional on survival). This procedure requires us to estimate actual income mobility processes in the economies under study. Then, in order to assess the impact of income mobility, we compare the corrected poverty rates under income mobility with the ones obtained under no income mobility for missing (i.e. prematurely dead) persons.====Anticipating on our results, we show that poverty rates corrected under assumptions (i) and (ii) differ from standard poverty rates, and that the correction for the missing poor problem affects the comparison of old-age poverty across countries and gender. When comparing the gaps between adjusted and standard poverty measures with the ones obtained while assuming no income mobility (and thus relaxing assumption (ii)), we show that upward income mobility reduces those gaps, but to an extent that varies across countries. Thus taking income mobility into account matters for the correction of poverty measures. In addition, our analysis shows that the size of the gap between standard and corrected poverty rates depends also on whether the poverty line is based either on the pre-adjustment income distribution, or on the post-adjustment income distribution, and on whether the poverty line is relative or absolute.====Our paper is related to the literature on the missing poor, such as Kanbur and Mukherjee (2007) and Lefebvre et al. (Lefebvre, Pestieau, Ponthiere, 2013, Lefebvre, Pestieau, Ponthiere, 2018). Our paper, which examines poverty measurement in presence of income-differentiated mortality, is also related to the growing literature on lifetime poverty, such as Foster (2009), Bossert et al. (2011) and Hoy and Zheng (2011), since the assignment of fictitious incomes to the prematurely dead constitutes a solution to allow for the comparison of poverty along lives of unequal lengths. Finally, we also complement the literature on income mobility (Fields and Ok, 1996, 1999; Van Kerm, 2004, Van Kerm, 2009; Van Kerm and Alperin (2013)), by examining the relation between income mobility and the missing poor problem.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a simple model of old-age poverty measurement under income-differentiated mortality. Section 3 compares standard and hypothetical old-age poverty rates for 12 European countries. Section 4 studies the robustness of the correction of poverty rates to the assumption on income mobility. Section 5 examines the robustness of our results to allowing the poverty line to vary with the addition of missing persons. Finally, Section 6 assesses the robustness of our results to adopting an absolute poverty line equal to 10 euros a day. Additional robustness issues are examined in Section 7.

Using two independent survey datasets on Chinese internal migration, we examine whether and how migrant children-related factors are associated with migrant parents’ intention of permanent urban settlement.

The probability of permanent urban settlement intention of parents with migrant children is 49% higher than those without. The results are robust to a series of sensitivity tests. Potential channels for the findings are also explored.","Population migration from rural to urban areas in developing countries is one of the central issues discussed in labor economics (Harris and Michael, 1970, Stark and Bloom, 1985, Lucas, 1997, Borjas, 1999). As the largest developing country in the world, China has witnessed rapid urbanization and substantial increase in internal migration since the early 1980s. The number of migrants in China has increased from 6.57 million in 1982 to 245.97 million in 2015, accompanied with the increasing urbanization rate from 21.1% to 56.1%.==== Internal migration from rural to urban areas has substantially improved the efficiency of labor allocation and contributed to urban economic growth (Cai and Wang, 2008).====However, a major problem with Chinese urbanization process is that many migrant workers remain excluded from the urban social welfare system and have to float across cities for jobs, thereby slowing the growth of permanent urban settlement (or the civilization of rural migrants). For example, 49.7% of China's population worked in urban areas in 2010, however, only 28.3% of them had urban citizenship (i.e., urban ====).==== Such a floating pattern may lower employers’ incentives to invest human capital on migrant workers (Knight and Yueh, 2004). Many scholars believe that the increase in permanent urban settlement may help improve the growth potential of Chinese economy in the long run (Cai, 2013).====The question on migrants’ permanent settlement in a destination city seems to receive less attention in the migration literature compared with extensive studies on the determinants and effect of population migration across regions (Zhao, 1999, Du et al., 2005, Mu and Brauw, 2015). Until recently, to our knowledge, a growing body of literature began to focus on the determinants of migrants’ permanent settlement from different perspectives (Hu et al., 2011, Cao et al., 2015, Hao and Tang, 2015, Chen and Liu, 2016, Meng and Zhao, 2018, Xie, 2018).==== Meng and Zhao (2018) show that rural land holding reduces the likelihood of permanent migration and full access to urban social benefits help attract rural migrants to move in permanently. A similar finding is also reported in Hao and Tang (2015) who focus on the relationship between rural land holding and migrants’ settlement intention in Jiangsu province of China. Xie and Chen (2018) examine the effects of urban housing-related factors (e.g., housing ownership, size, and subsidy) on migrants’ urban settlement intentions. Using the migrant survey data from 12 Chinese cities, Cao et al. (2015) find that self-employed migrants are more intent to settle permanently in urban areas.====In this paper, we contribute to the literature by relating children-related factors to migrants’ intention of permanent urban settlement. Previous migration studies usually disregard that the migration decision of married individuals may differ from that of single individuals (Meng et al., 2016). In particular, migration or settlement decision may be complicated when children-related factors are considered. Migrant parents may care about not only the utility from their own consumption, but also the utility from their children’ well-being when deciding to settle down permanently in a destination city. The proportion of family migrants (i.e., migrating with children) in the total migrants has considerably increased over the decade, which provides us an opportunity to examine whether and how migrant children are associated with the permanent settlement intention of their parents in a destination city.====We first develop a simple conceptual framework to explore the potential differences in the intention of permanent urban settlement between family and non-family migrants. We use the survey data of the Rural Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) and a Probit model to examine whether migrant children are positively associated with their parents’ intention of permanent settlement in a destination city. To address potential endogeneity problem, we use a recursive bivariate Probit model with instrumental variables. We use family migration proportion in migrants’ source province, school distance between the hometown village of the migrant and the nearest primary school and whether the child was born after parents’ migration as the instruments. Our instrumental variable estimations show that migrant children affect the intention of their parents to settle permanently in a destination city. Parents with migrant children have higher intention (49% higher) to settle in the destination city permanently than those without. The major effects are derived from the utility gain of an increase in the human capital of children in the destination city and family unification.====Previous studies show that access to urban public school may improve the academic achievement of migrant children (e.g., Chen and Feng, 2013). Thus, the findings presented in the paper imply that equalizing local public educational opportunities for migrant children in cities may help improve migrant parents’ potential utility from children's human capital accumulation in cities. In turn, parents’ intention of permanent urban settlement may increase, thereby ultimately promoting the human capital accumulation of migrant parents and children.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the background of internal migration in China. Section 3 presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the potential mechanisms for the decision making of migrant parents on permanent settlement in a destination city.

Exploiting rule-based variation in the allocation of governors connected to their superior at the time of appointment, we find that modern-day countries exposed to more patronage governors exhibit lower fiscal capacity today. These negative effects are persistent over time and driven by ","Fiscal capacity is a key determinant of economic development (Besley and Persson, 2009). The ability of states to tax and provide public services is seen as a pre-requisite for the emergence of the modern economy. Despite its importance, we know relatively little about the colonial origins of fiscal capacity. While a long tradition of work focuses on explaining historical investments in fiscal capacity for today’s developed (European) countries over time (North, Weingast, 1989, Tilly, 1990), there is less empirical evidence on what explains fiscal capacity in modern day countries that emerged from decolonization.====This paper studies the colonial origins of fiscal capacity by asking whether the exposure to colonial governors under a specific system of appointment - namely patronage - had any long-term impacts on the ability of modern-day countries to raise taxes. The study of fiscal capacity through the lens of colonialism is interesting for several reasons. First, colonialism was a defining episode in history - most developing countries today experienced a period of colonization. Second, by nature of colonialism, policy choices were often externally imposed, thus providing a plausibly exogenous source of variation in historical public investments. Finally, the sheer size of Empires allows a focus on single colonizers. At its peak, the British Empire, for example, spanned 20% of the Earth’s landmass. The focus on a single organization enables us to hold constant cross-colonizer differences in institutions and colonization strategies.====We study the exposure of former British colonies to patronage governors during the colonial period 1854–1966. Patronage governors are senior bureaucrats who held social ties to their superior, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, at time of their appointment. These patronage connections have shown to be an important determinant for the assignment of governors to colonies. Most importantly, favored protégées have been documented to raise less indirect taxes and invest less in the revenue generation capacity of their assigned territories (Xu, 2018). As governors wielded power over their assigned colonies, especially in terms of public finance, these patronage governors may have had lasting impacts beyond the colonial period.====The main difficulty in estimating such long-run relationships is that governors are not randomly allocated across colonies. In the context of the British Empire, patronage governors were historically allocated to higher salaried and larger colonies (Jones, 2013, Xu, 2018). If these differences across colonies persist, it is difficult to empirically disentangle the impact of patronage governors from selection. In order to overcome this empirical challenge, we introduce a novel microfounded instrument, making use of a six-year fixed term rule that was in place during the colonial period to instrument for the cumulative exposure to patronage governors. Specifically, we exploit the interaction between the staggered opening of vacancies and the governors’ social ties to the Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time of appointment to compute the share of patronage governors who face a higher probability of being transferred to another colony. Given the rule-based variation, we argue and provide evidence that (i) longitudinal variation in the share of available patronage governors a year before the vacancy is filled predicts the probability of actually receiving a patronage governor, and (ii) this variation is uncorrelated with colony-level characteristics.====Our central outcome measure is the tax-to-GDP ratio. This is the central measure in the fiscal capacity literature (Besley and Persson, 2009). Exploiting the exogenous source of variation in the assignment of patronage governors to colonies, we find that an increase in the share of patronage governors in the colonial period by 1% point decreases the tax/GDP ratio in 2015 by 1.6% points. The variation in exposure to patronage governors explains around 8% of the overall cross-sectional variation in the modern tax/GDP ratio. This negative relationship is persistent over time between 1980 and 2015. The observed decline in modern tax/GDP is driven by a lower share of indirect taxes, in particular trade taxes. This is consistent with historical evidence that connected governors adversely affected fiscal capacity through trade taxes and exemptions. The results thus uncover a public finance channel through which historical patronage governors impact fiscal capacity beyond decolonization.====The limited number of modern day countries that emerged from the British Empire following decolonization imposes data constraints on the analysis. We use weak instrument robust inference, re-sampling and randomization inference to confirm the statistical significance of the main finding. We also conduct a range of additional checks to confirm that the results are not driven by selection. The point estimates are robust to the inclusion of a wide range of candidate confounders. In addition, a bounding exercise suggests that selection on unobservables needs to be implausibly large to “explain away” the main results.====By providing evidence for persistence, these results suggest that the short-run costs of patronage shown in Xu (2018) also extend to the long-run.==== The findings thus link two strands of the literature on long-run development. First, we add to the literature on the long-run determinants of fiscal capacity (Besley, Persson, 2009, Huillery, 2009). Much empirical work in this area has focused on studying the impacts of fiscal capacity and focused on today’s developed countries (Aidt and Jensen (2009); Dincecco and Prado (2012); Dincecco and Katz, 2016). Our study provides evidence on how differences in fiscal capacity emerge and persist in the long-run, covering former colonies across all continents.==== Second, we contribute to the literature on the persistence of colonial legacies. Most work has focused on the role of colonial institutions (Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001, La Porta, Rafael, Lopez-De-Silanes, Shleifer, Vishny, 1999, Dell, 2010, Dell, Olken, 2017, Anderson, 2018). We complement this literature by highlighting the role of colonial leaders and their means of appointment. Using variation from the rotation rule - a common feature of bureaucracies - we link the literature on colonial legacies to the personnel economics of the Empire, speaking to the administrative determinants of development (Greif, 2007).",The colonial origins of fiscal capacity: Evidence from patronage governors,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718303937,14 January 2019,2019,Research Article,243.0

We argue that this is partially explained by the incentives of sub-central governments upon receiving their new authority. Sub-central governments are more incentivized than national ones to pursue policy improvements that are more visible and quicker to achieve, even when they are costly – like improving access – over improvements that are less visible and take longer to achieve – like increasing quality. Decentralization should therefore result in positive effects on education access and negative on quality, consistent with our findings. We directly test the impact of political incentives on responses to decentralization by exploiting the timing of education decentralization in Spain (1980–99), and variation in the political assertiveness of regional governments, using generalized difference-in-differences and synthetic controls.

I examine the effect of peacetime conscription on early labor market outcomes of potential conscripts ==== they are called up for service. In the first part, I exploit the abolition of conscription in Spain as a natural experiment. In a difference-in-differences framework, I show that the abolition of conscription in Spain increased the labor force participation of teenage men by 6.7% compared to men in their twenties, and employment by 11%, while reducing unemployment in this group by 9%. Interestingly, I find opposite effects on teenage women in Spain who are not subject to conscription suggesting high degree of substitutability between young men and women in the labor market. I also point out that although the labor force participation rates of men in their twenties are quite similar across Turkey, Peru and Argentina, that of teenage men is significantly lower in Turkey, which has compulsory military service.","Throughout the twentieth century, the armed forces in many countries recruited personnel through conscription. Given the compulsory military service (CMS) laws, a significant portion of sixty year-old males around the world served in the military when they were young. However, since the end of the Cold War many countries have moved from conscription to all-volunteer armies, especially in North America and Europe. France, considered the first country to introduce modern conscription, abolished it in 1997, and most recently Germany abolished conscription in 2011. Yet some European countries and many Asian and African countries including Austria, Brazil, Greece, Denmark, Egypt, Israel, Russia, South Korea, and Turkey still use conscription to supply their armed forces with qualified personnel. Among the latter group, the duration of compulsory service and the possibility of eliminating it have frequently been debated.====The recent literature examines the effect of military service on individual outcomes such as labor market performance, educational attainment, cigarette and alcohol consumption, and criminal activity.==== Identifying the effect of conscription on individual outcomes is a difficult task because there is non-random selection to the military service. Even countries with universal conscription allow certain exemptions based on characteristics such as health and occupation. Thus comparing the individual outcomes of interest between veterans and non-veterans is misleading unless the characteristics that determine the veteran status are carefully controlled.==== Therefore, some papers focusing on individual outcomes use instrumental variables to explain military service, while others, like this paper, obtain Intent-to-Treat estimates on the cohorts who are eligible for military conscription.====Angrist (1990) and Angrist and Krueger (1994) investigate the effect of wartime military service during Vietnam War and World War II on future labor market outcomes, and use date of birth as an instrumental variable for the probability of being drafted. These studies found that white Vietnam-era veterans earn 15% lower annual wages than non-veterans 10 years after the war, and World War II veterans earn no more, possibly less, than non-veterans. Imbens and van der Klaauw (1995) use variation in the aggregate military enrollment rates across cohorts in a grouped-data IV framework, and find that 10 years after service, those who served in the peacetime earn 5% lower annual wages than those who did not in the Netherlands. Grenet et al. (2011) exploit the discontinuous change in the probability of conscription into the British army during the post-war period in a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and find no effect on earnings of peacetime compulsory military service. Loughran and Klerman (2012) investigate the effect of reserve activation in the US on post-activation civilian earnings of reservists. They find moderate losses in earnings in the year immediately after the activation that disappear in the subsequent years. Similarly, Bauer et al. (2012) use RDD based on a discontinuity in the probability of being drafted across cohorts in Germany and find no significant effect of conscription on future wage or employment of the former conscripts. Paloyo (2010) revisits conscription in Germany in a difference-in-differences framework and verifies that CMS has no effect on the labor market performance of conscripts. Card and Cardoso (2011) investigate the mandatory service in Portugal for the 1967 cohort, and find zero effect for men with higher education and positive effect for less educated men. As we move to the recent times, the basic education given in the military is less and less useful in the professional life.====In this paper, I examine the effect of peacetime conscription on the early labor market outcomes of potential conscripts ==== they are called up for service. In a framework with costly job search and no job security, an expected interruption in civilian life around the age 20 reduces the incentive of teenagers to search for a job. Individuals optimize between searching and not searching at the onset of their career, and balances the cost of search with the wage benefit of employment considering the probability of losing his job due to compulsory conscription. In such a framework, as the probability of conscription in a country increases less people join the labor force before the conscription age. Equivalently, if a country abolishes conscription, labor force participation among young men increases. A similar reasoning applies to cross-country analysis.====Moreover, when firms bear the cost of on-the-job training, an expected interruption reduces the employers’ likelihood of offering a job to expected future conscripts. Suppose that, there is a one-time on-the-job training cost for all new hires at the expense of employer. If a worker leaves the firm due to conscription, then he needs to be trained again when he is back in the labor market due to depreciation of skills or firm-specific training. In the absence of conscription, an employer would prefer hiring someone early in his life because he is able to employ the worker for a longer period of time and only pays the training cost once. The advantage of younger applicants compared to older ones decreases as the conscription probability in a country increases. Similarly, if a country abolishes conscription completely, the employment likelihood of men younger than the age of conscription rises.====In the first part of my analysis, I exploit a natural experiment in Spain, the abolition of conscription in 2001. Using the Economically Active Population Survey (EPA) data in a difference-in-differences framework, I find that the abolition of conscription increased the labor force participation of teenage men by 5.9 percentage points (6.7%) compared to men in their twenties and increased their employment by 6.7 percentage points (11%). Results also suggest a decrease in the likelihood of unemployment by around 3.1 percentage points (9%). Finally, I find opposite results for teenage women, suggesting substitutability in the labor market. Teenage women experience a 7.5% decrease in the labor force participation after the abolition of conscription. In the second part, I compare labor force participation and employment rates of men across ages in the countries with and without a mandatory conscription. Using micro data from Turkey (which has CMS), Peru and Argentina (which do not have CMS) I show that, although labor force participation rates are very similar in all three countries among men in their twenties with the same level of education, labor force participation is significantly lower among teenage men in the country with compulsory military service.====The first contribution of this study is to highlight the anticipation effects of CMS, as the previous literature focuses on the effect on subsequent labor market outcomes only. By showing the ex-ante effects of CMS, I point out one cause of low labor force participation among youth in the countries with CMS, which is a common concern around the world. Second, I show one channel through which conscription may affect future labor market outcomes of individuals. It is well documented that early labor market experiences have significant effects on later labor market outcomes (Smith, 1985).==== Finally, the natural experiment in Spain, the abolition of conscription, also demonstrates the substitutability in the labor market across genders. My findings should be interpreted as Intent-to-Treat estimates, or the effect of the existence of conscription in a country.==== It is also important to note that although both wartime and peacetime military service cause a loss of job market experience among those who serve, the war-time military service has a higher physical and psychological cost.",Ex-ante labor market effects of compulsory military service,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718306115,March 2019,2019,Research Article,245.0

This study shows how a Chinese city was successful in helping its low-performing schools to catch up by encouraging talented students to sort into these schools. The city identified eleven low-performing middle schools and guaranteed elite high school admission to their top ten-percent graduates. This study documents that the policy improved school performance by 0.19-0.26 ====. Using data on lottery middle school assignment, I further test for potential mechanisms, including strategic sorting and improvement in school value-added.","School choice policies including vouchers and lotteries have been widely adopted in many countries. The underlying idea is that these policies give students and parents more freedom in choosing schools, and schools are under more pressure to improve quality to attract students. However, these school-choice policies have had mixed results and, somewhat problematically, have in some cases increased sorting and stratification.==== When given choices, students with low socioeconomic status (SES) are less likely to apply to a good school (Ajayi, 2011, Walters, 2013, Hoxby, Avery, 2013). Theoretical and empirical evidence shows that students with high SES and high ability sort out of low-performing schools, leaving disadvantaged students behind (Epple, Romano, 1998, Levin, 1998, Hsieh, Urquiola, 2006, Galiani, Gertler, Schargrodsky, 2008, Chakrabarti, 2013, Muralidharan, Sundararaman, 2015). Given the importance of peer composition in the education production function (Epple and Romano, 2011), this sorting pattern may lead to more inequality (Calabrese et al., 2012). How to change sorting given choices so as to close the performance gaps is still an open question.====This study evaluates a policy that provides incentive for high ability students to voluntarily enroll in low-performing schools under a choice-based lottery school assignment system. Changsha, a Chinese provincial capital city with a population of seven million, introduced the top ten-percent quota policy in 2007. The education bureau chose one or two low-performing public middle schools in each district and guaranteed admission to an elite high school for the top ten-percent of 9th grade graduates from each of these schools. This paper answers two questions: Did the top ten-percent quota policy narrow the school performance gap? And if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?====To estimate the policy impact, I employ a generalized difference-in-differences identification strategy with a panel data set of middle school graduation exam performance from 2004 to 2011. Validity of random policy assignment is verified by testing whether various observable pre-policy school characteristics, including school size, school performance, and distance to elite high school, could predict policy treatment status. Results from generalized difference-in-differences regressions show that the policy schools improved their average performances by around 0.2 standard deviations in the middle school graduation exam. Their school ranking also increased by around twelve percentile. Placebo tests were conducted to show that the treatment effects do not generalize on other low-performing schools.====This positive policy impact could be working through various possible mechanisms, including a composition effect, a tournament effect, and a peer effect.==== First, a conceptual framework in Section 5 illustrates the trade-offs on whether to change enrollment choice from an over-subscribed school to a low-performing policy school. It predicts that above average students who are not at the top of the talent distribution are most likely to switch to low-performing policy schools.==== Second, competition to place at the top ten-percent may stimulate a higher effort level exerted by students, especially the top-performing ones. Third, with better peer groups and a more active learning environment, it may bring positive spill-over effects on non-switchers: students who chose an over-subscribed school but lost the lottery and students who would have chosen a low-performing school anyway. The first channel redistributes students across schools; the latter two channels increase the value-added at the policy schools.====To test the mechanisms, I exploit Changsha’s preference-based lottery middle school assignment. Since 1996, the Changsha education bureau has assigned a fixed number of seats in several neighborhood public middle schools to each elementary school every year. A sixth grade student chooses one from the short list of middle schools assigned to his/her elementary school.==== In cases of over-enrollment, a lottery takes place and randomly assigns winners to their chosen school and losers to the under-subscribed low-performing school, some of which were assigned the top ten-percent quotas. This allows me to analyze changes in students’ school choices and compare the outcomes of lottery winners with those of lottery losers to obtain unambiguous results on the value-added gap between policy schools and over-subscribed schools.====Observing the school choices by sixth graders, I compare the baseline performance of students who voluntarily chose the policy schools before and after the policy. I found that sixth graders with high math scores and high SES were more likely to choose a policy school after the policy. In particular, students with high, but not the highest, sixth grade math scores changed their school choice to policy schools after the policy introduction. This result is consistent with predictions from the conceptual framework.====Using lottery assignment as the instrument variable, I estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) of attending a policy school before and after the introduction of the top ten-percent quota policy. Estimates show that policy school attendance caused a 0.3 standard deviation decrease in academic performance of lottery losers before the policy; this value-added gap was closed after the policy. With better peer quality, policy schools may improve their value-added for all students; extra effort to place at the top ten-percent brings a tournament effect only for the high-performing students. To estimate heterogeneous effects, I conduct instrumental variable quantile treatment effect (QTE) analysis (Abadie et al., 2002) to test how the policy changed the distribution of value-added gap. Results shows that before the policy, the value-added gap was negative for most deciles across the distribution, and more so for high-performing students. After the policy, the value-added gaps were closed for most of the deciles, except for the sixtieth and ninetieth percentile. Since students at low quantiles would only be subject to changes in peer effects but not tournament effects, improvements on value-added at low deciles suggest that peer effects are at work. The policy closed not only the performance gap but also the value-added gap between the low-performing policy schools and the over-subscribed schools.====This study contributes to the literature on school choice. Attending private or charter schools sometimes brings academic and/or nonacademic benefits to the lottery winners.==== However, school choice reforms may increase sorting and may widen the performance gap (Epple, Romano, 1998, Levin, 1998, Hsieh, Urquiola, 2006, Calabrese, Epple, Romano, 2012, Galiani, Gertler, Schargrodsky, 2008, Chakrabarti, 2013). Similar to previous studies (Ajayi, 2011, Butler, Carr, Toma, Zimmer, 2013, Hastings, Kane, Staiger, 2008, Hoxby, Avery, 2013, Walters, 2013), I find that students with lower SES are less likely to choose an over-subscribed school. Previous research attempted to improve school choice by providing information for parents and students and found that it helps in some cases, but not in others.====Aside from efforts to help disadvantaged students choose and attend better schools, some studies have also looked more directly on how to improve the quality of low-performing schools. Angrist et al. (2013) and Dobbie and Fryer (2013) found that the “No Excuses” model of urban education is the key to charter school effectiveness. In the case of the top ten-percent quota policy, combining school choice with incentives for high-achieving students to attend lower-performing schools helps change the sorting patterns and narrow the performance gap. More importantly, instrumental QTE results show that the value-added gap is also closed almost everywhere across the distribution, which suggests that positive peer effects brought on by the composition changes are at work.====This study also contributes to an emerging literature on school choice in China’s context. Prior studies investigate whether attending a sought-after result in significant gains in student outcomes and have mixed findings (Dee, Lan, 2015, Park, Shi, Hsieh, An, 2015, Ma, Shi, 2014, Zhang, 2016). In particular, Dee and Lan (2015) and Zhang (2016) find null results in a city in Inner Mongolia and in a provincial capital city. On the other hand, Ma and Shi (2014) and Park et al. (2015) find positive effects in a high school in Hebei Province and in rural counties in Western China. This paper shows that the effect of winning a school lottery may not be static over time since school quality of the comparison groups could evolve due to a policy change. This paper is closely connected to how peer effects play an important role in Chinese middle schools (Ding and Lehrer, 2007). Lai et al. (2009) and He et al. (2012) find that strategic school choice process can be complicated for families without sufficient resources to navigate. This paper finds similar patterns that students with disadvantaged backgrounds tend to make worse school choices and are less likely to take up strategic opportunities. In addition, I show that certain students indeed respond to policy incentives and change their school choices, which could lead to positive spillover effects.====Another strand of related literature studies how relative evaluation changes sorting. A similar policy in the U.S. is the top x-percent rule in Texas, California and Florida, which guarantees flagship state university admission for top x-percent of seniors in all high schools. These policies and Changsha’s policy differ in the school level (middle school vs. high school), in the affected schools (some low-performing schools vs. all schools) and most importantly, in their purposes. Changsha introduced the top ten-percent quota policy to improve low-performing schools by changing composition and improving school quality collectively, while top x% in the U.S. mainly aims at improving the minority students representation in selective colleges after the affirmative action ban (Long, 2004, Long, Saenz, Tienda, 2010). Therefore, while sorting emerges in both cases, the change in sorting was unintended in Texas (Cullen et al., 2013), but it was expected and beneficial in the case of Changsha.====Results here on the top ten-percent quota policy complement previous findings on the Texas Ten-Percent Law. Cullen et al. (2013) and this study provide converging evidence that relative evaluation brings different sorting behaviors and improves student composition in low-performing schools. Although the top x-percent rule fails to promote the opportunity of minority groups as well as the affirmative action (Long, 2004, Long, Saenz, Tienda, 2010), it helps low-performing high schools to improve their performance faster than other schools (Cortes and Zhang, 2011). I also find that in the case of Changsha, policy schools caught up in their performance. Further, this study advances previous studies by estimating the value-added gap before and after the policy, exploiting Changsha’s unique lottery school assignment, and shows that the school quality improved as well.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background on the top ten-percent quota policy and choice-based lottery middle school assignment. Section 3 describes data construction, and thus why and how I use the data to conduct the analysis. Section 4 evaluates the policy impact on school performances using a generalized difference-in-differences framework. Section 5 provides a conceptual framework on school choice and exploits the preference-based lottery middle school assignment to test changes in composition and in value-added.

The establishment of this region institutionalizes indigenous authorities and prohibits land privatization. This study investigates the effect of the recognition of common property land to indigenous groups on economic performance. By using difference-in-differences approach at household-level data, I find that non-migrant indigenous households living in the semi-autonomous territory declined their consumption relative to their counterparts living outside. Further, indigenous households living in the semi-autonomous territory have lower access to public goods and are less likely to participate in agricultural market activities.","In 2007, 144 countries voted in favor of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP) to recognize the importance of indigenous peoples' rights. UNDRIP indicates that indigenous peoples' rights to land and resources will enable them to strengthen their institutions and to promote their development. Land is the main asset that indigenous people possess and, in many countries, they experience high levels of land tenure insecurity. Indigenous land rights tend to be in the form of common property resources. Common property resources may lead to good economic outcomes when principals cope with free riding, solve commitment problems, arrange new institutions, and monitor individuals in order to follow rules (Ostrom, 1990).====The rights of indigenous people to land is a topic that has gotten wide attention in multiple social sciences. A large number of indigenous groups have no history of shared or centralized governance over their territories. Recent research has attributed poor economic performance to the integration of people who had no history of political centralization into jurisdictions (Dippel, 2014, Gennaioli and Rainer, 2007).====This paper intends to examine whether the recognition of common property land to indigenous groups without centralized political culture have any impact on their economic condition. I exploit the creation of an indigenous semi-autonomous territory in western Panama to understand this topic. The Government of Panama with Law 10 of 1997 and the publication of the Organic Charter (Carta Organica) in the Official Gazette in 1999 creates Comarca==== Ngobe-Bugle in western Panama. The vast majority of the inhabitants of the indigenous territory are members of the Ngobe and Bugle groups.==== These ethnic groups do not share history of centralized political organization and decision were made at the family-level.====The Government of Panama only granted half of the land requested by the Ngobe-Bugle authorities. This left a portion of the indigenous people living outside the territory (Wickstrom, 2003). I use a difference-in-differences approach to examine whether the economic conditions of Ngobe-Bugle people living inside and outside the indigenous semi-autonomous area differ across groups after the recognition of Ngobe-Bugle authorities and land tenure systems.====Using a difference-in-differences methodology, I find evidence that Ngobe-Bugle households living inside the indigenous region have lower consumption relative to their indigenous counterparts outside the semi-autonomous area after the recognition of Comarca Ngobe-Bugle. My results are robust to the inclusion of control variables and district fixed effects. Consumption has stagnated in the areas determined as Comarca Ngobe-Bugle while indigenous households’ consumption has grown outside Comarca Ngobe-Bugle. These results can be explained by the following mechanisms. First, political conflicts within the indigenous authorities coupled with lack of coordination between the Government of Panama and the indigenous leaders in the communal territory may decrease incentives to invest in public goods and other productive investments (e.g. roads) in the semi-autonomous territory. Secondly, indigenous households inside Comarca Ngobe-Bugle may engage in traditional activities while non-Comarca households may be more exposed to a market economy. Difference-in-differences results confirm that agricultural market participation is lower within Comarca Ngobe-Bugle than outside after the recognition of indigenous authorities over their land.====One line of research investigates the impact of the creation of artificial boundaries and lack of political centralization on economic outcomes. For example, Dippel (2014) shows that the integration of ethnic groups with no history of centralized or shared governance reduces per capita income in reservations in the US. The author suggests that an increase in political conflict creates an uncertain business environment. As mentioned above, the Ngobe and Bugle political culture is segmentary and without clear leadership (Wickstrom, 2003). Recently, the Ngobe-Bugle people have displayed unity in order to obtain their land rights and to protest against hydroelectric dam projects near their lands, however, high levels of corruption in their organization exists (Jordan-Ramos, 2010, Wickstrom, 2003).====This paper contributes to the literature that explains the causes of under-performance of indigenous people by examining the economic impact of the creation of an indigenous semi-autonomous region. Indigenous people are the poorest and more vulnerable citizens of Latin America since they tend to live in difficult-access areas, have lower education attainment, and lower access to basic sanitation. This area of research emphasizes the significance of institutions, economic and political integration, and property rights mostly using empirical evidence from North American aboriginals (Aragón, 2015, Dippel, 2014, Gitter and Reagan, 2002). This paper presents new empirical evidence from an understudied group and a very specific case of granting some type of rights over land.====This research relates to the effects of institutions and artificial jurisdictional boundaries on current economic performance. A large number of research use institutions to explain the differences in development throughout the world. Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) show that the institutional choice by a country is the main driver of cross-country income disparities today. Similarly, Easterly and Levine (2003) conclude that institutions predominantly affect income. However, the impact of institutions as the main factor for development is not a consensus in the economic literature. Sachs (2003) argues that geography is a stronger explanatory variable to understand cross-country income differences. Further, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013) found that cross-border differences in institutions do not translate into differences in economic performance within partitioned ethnicities in Africa.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Various channels have been investigated to account for the correlation between specific religious denominations and economic performance including, the role of financial and commercial institutions, as argued by Kuran, 1996, Kuran, 1997, Kuran, 2004), the role of the state, as Platteau (2008) suggested, or the impact of religion on values and attitudes towards economic activities, which is Weber's (1904/1905) argument and was recently illustrated by Guiso et al. (2003) and Hillman (2007).====One implication of this impact of religion on attitudes concerns education, which directly promotes development. While the impact of education on development is uncontroversial, as Hannushek and Woessmann's (2008) survey shows, some denominations put more emphasis on education than others. Some denominations even promote literacy as a religious duty. For instance, Botticini and Eckstein, 2005, Botticini and Eckstein, 2007, Botticini and Eckstein, 2012 recall that male Jews must be able to read the Torah in the Synagogue and teach it to their sons. Similarly, the principle of the priesthood of all believers implies that each Protestant should be able to read the Holy Scriptures.====Most arguments relating specific denominations to education share a common feature: they assume that denominations carry universal messages resulting in a universal incentive to acquire more, or less, education. They therefore imply that the impact of each denomination should be the same across countries. We refer to this contention as the “universal message hypothesis.” Yet, religion is also a social activity that could be considered as a club good (Iannaccone, 1992), hence we may assume that the same denomination may prompt its members to adopt different behaviors in different social contexts. A denomination may be dominant in one country and persecuted in others. It may be a majority in some countries and a minority in others. As a result, one may expect the impact of religious denominations to be context-dependent. We refer to this contention as the “context-dependence hypothesis.”====Unfortunately, that contention has received little attention so far. Most existing studies of the impact of religion on education are either country-specific or based on cross-country regressions. This is the case of Chiswick (1988) and Glaeser and Sacerdote (2008) for the United States, Brown and Taylor (2007) for the United Kingdom, or Blunch (2007) for Ghana. By construction, they cannot compare the effect of religious denominations across countries. Some studies take a more macroeconomic standpoint and are based on cross-country comparisons. This is what Guiso et al., 2003, Schaltegger and Torgler, 2010, or Arruñada (2010) do, although they focus on attitudes rather than on education. In such regressions, however, one runs the risk of attributing to religion differences that are related to other country-specific traits, such as geography or institutional quality. Most of all, those regressions force the effect of religious denominations to be the same across countries.====In this paper, we specifically allow the correlation with education of religious denominations to differ across countries and factor in the minority status of each denomination. To do so, we follow Guiso et al. (2003) and use the World Values Survey, which provides individual data on educational attainment, religious denomination, and religiosity in a large sample of countries. Unlike Guiso et al. (2003), we take advantage of the two-level structure of the World Values Survey to separately estimate the role of religious denominations in all countries.====Our first key finding is that no single religious denomination has a universal correlation with education. Each denomination correlates at the same time positively and statistically significantly in some countries, and negatively and statistically significantly in other countries, while the correlation is statistically insignificant elsewhere. In other words, we find the role of religious denominations to be country-specific. The finding is robust to controlling for individuals’ level of religiosity or not, and to focusing on individuals born in their country of residence. It holds equally for individuals below and over forty years old, and for male and female respondents.====Next, we investigate what determines the positive, negative or neutral correlation with education of an individual's religious denomination in a country. We, more specifically, test the role of the denomination's minority status. We expect that being a minority religion is a key determinant of the impact of a denomination on educational outcomes, although the sign of the effect on education of being a minority is ambiguous a priori. One the one hand, if minority denominations are discriminated against by teachers (Coate and Loury, 1993, Hanna and Linden, 2012), internalize negative stereotypes (Hoff and Pandey, 2006), have a limited access to social capital (Coleman, 1988), or oppose the values of the majority to avoid a loss in self-image (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, Akerlof and Kranton, 2002), then they should be more likely to result in lower educational outcomes. On the other hand, if investing in education is a way to cope with discrimination (Brenner and Kiefer, 1981), or if members of minority denominations compensate for their lack of connections with the majority by stronger ties within their community (Coleman, 1988), benefit from positive stereotypes (Shih et al., 2002), or develop an identity that emphasizes academic effort (Akerlof and Kranton, 2002), then minority denominations may be associated with better educational outcomes.====To determine which effect prevails, we regress respondents’ educational level on a dummy variable capturing whether their denomination is a minority in their country. We find that denominations that are a minority in a country correlate positively with the level of education of their followers in that country. The finding is robust to considering alternative thresholds to define religious minorities, to dropping observations that correspond to very small minorities, to coding education as a binary variable, and to allowing the correlation of minority status with education to be denomination-specific.====Those results directly contribute to our understanding of the relation between religious denominations and education, by emphasizing that their role is context-dependent and highlighting that it depends on being a minority. These results more broadly contribute to our knowledge of the impact of culture, surveyed in Alesina and Giuliano (2015), and identity, surveyed by Kranton (2016). We show that the same cultural trait or identity characteristic, religious denomination, can play different roles across countries depending on the context.====Our paper is, to our knowledge, the first to jointly analyze the nexus between religion, education, and minority status by exploiting the within- and cross-country dimensions of the World Values Survey. Admittedly, using cross-country analysis comes at a cost, as clean identification is difficult to achieve. Our results should therefore be interpreted as measuring conditional correlations rather than causal effects.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we survey the literature on the impact of religious denominations on education. In the following section, we perform a country-by-country study of the correlation of individual denominations with education. We observe unexpected differences across countries regarding the effect of religious denominations on education that are hidden by cross-country regressions. In the third section, we investigate the role of belonging to a religious minority.

Many empirical studies have examined whether election-motivated politicians manipulate macroeconomic variables in pursuit of re-election. Politicians have been shown to increase current expenditure at the cost of public investment, increase public health and other social expenditure, and boost short-term GDP growth before elections. Governments sugarcoat the budget balance by means of creative accounting – that is, “below-the-line” operations such as transactions in financial assets that do not show up in deficit figures, but give rise to changes in public debt. Monetary aggregates were increased before elections not just to promote economic performance but to buy votes. Donor countries have been shown to use foreign aid to manipulate elections in recipient countries (see, for example, Potrafke, 2010, Potrafke, 2012a, Faye and Niehaus, 2012, Aidt et al., 2015, Reischmann, 2016; for surveys De Haan and Klomp, 2013, Dubois, 2016).====Election-motivated politicians may also manipulate figures that cannot be measured by macroeconomic variables. In electoral districts or other closely-knit jurisdictions where voters directly punish or reward political candidates, politicians may be expected to behave corruptly before elections. For example, interest groups lobby and bribe politicians to implement or refrain from implementing specific policies. Corruption in the public sector is expected to be especially pronounced before elections because interest groups know that politicians are keen to gratify the needs of their constituencies and may solicit bribes. Electoral motives have been shown to cause politicians to allocate public funds inefficiently (Finan and Mazzocco, 2016). Politicians may want to buy votes before elections. On the other hand, corruption is not likely to increase before elections because voters dislike corrupt politicians. Empirical studies suggest that voters punish corrupt politicians. Using cross-sectional data for 35 countries, Krause and Mendez (2009) show that when the perceived level of government corruption increased, the total number of votes obtained by an incumbent decreased. The perceived level of government corruption was measured by Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI). Goel and Mazhar (2015) measure corruption by alternative indices and do not arrive at the conclusion that voters punish corrupt politicians. Many other studies exploit micro-data on political scandals in individual countries such as Brazil, Germany, Spain, and the United States. The evidence is mixed on whether incumbents suffer electoral consequences when involved in political scandals (see, for example, Costas-Pérez et al., 2012, Ferraz and Finan, 2008, Hirano and Snyder, 2012, Kauder and Potrafke, 2015, Rudolph and Däubler, 2016).==== Journalists enjoy revealing political scandals. In particular, before elections, journalists make an effort to reveal political scandals to jeopardize the election of promising challengers and/or entrenched incumbents. Politicians know that political careers can end if they get caught in political scandals. Thus, the extent to which elections influence corruption remains an empirical question.====Scholars have examined electoral corruption-cycles using regional data. A paper closely related to my study is Vadlamannati (2015). The author looks at whether the political business cycle theories apply to anti-corruption policies. He uses panel data for 30 Indian states over the period 1988–2009 and investigates whether incumbent governments were active in controlling corruption. The results show that the number of corruption cases registered by the individual state anti-corruption agency increased before regular elections, but did not increase before early elections. The effect of regular elections was large in “swing states,” that is, states with a small margin between the winning party and the runner-up. The results did not, however, show that the number of corruption cases being investigated by the anti-corruption agency increased before elections. The author concludes that election-motivated politicians likely manipulate macroeconomic variables as well as variables that track “key governance related issues” (p. 15).====In Russia, perceived corruption was also pronounced before elections.==== Sidorkin and Vorobyev (2018) find that corruption perceived by firms increased at the end of regional governors’ terms. The dataset includes some 5000 firms in 37 Russian regions over the period 2008–2012. The authors find that governors were especially active in corruption when they knew that their terms were about to expire and they would not be re-appointed. By contrast, when their re-appointment was likely, they were hardly inclined to participate in corrupt activities. Mironov and Zhuravskaya (2016) use data on allocation of public procurement (banking transactions among legal entities) in Russian regions over the period 1999–2004. The results show that politicians were more corrupt before elections to increase campaign contributions; firms bribed politicians to win procurement contracts. Bribing politicians to win procurement contracts was especially pronounced in regions that were corrupt as measured by Transparency International's regional CPI for Russia.====My study employs macro data and elaborates on international electoral cycles in perceived corruption. Using balanced panel data for around 100 democracies over the period 2012–2016, I examine whether perceived corruption in the public sector increased before elections. The measure of perceived corruption is the reversed CPI by Transparency International. The results show that the reversed CPI was about 0.4 points higher in election years than in other years. The effect is especially pronounced before early elections (1.0 points) compared to regular elections (0.4 points) and driven by parliamentary, not presidential elections.

We construct and test a model of bilateral FDI between countries that differ in their levels of corruption. FDI is affected negatively both by the level of corruption in the host country and by differences in home- and host-country corruption. Our model emphasizes that MNCs develop skills for dealing with home-country corruption, and these skills become a competitive advantage in similarly corrupt host countries. We test the model using data on bilateral FDI stocks among a large number of home and host countries, using a variety of specifications and estimation strategies to provide robustness. Our results show that the effects of host-country corruption and of differences in corruption levels between home and host countries are statistically and economically significant.","In 1998, El Salvador privatized its telecom sector through the sale of the national telephone company to France Telecom. After a five-year period of erratic profits and some losses, France Telecom sold a controlling interest in its Salvadoran affiliate to a Mexican company, which quickly succeeded in improving the telecom's financial performance. What can explain the success of the Mexican owner in improving the affiliate's performance so markedly? A Salvadoran telecom manager told one of the authors of this paper, “… the Mexicans understood how to get things done in El Salvador, and they were uninhibited and ruthless in comparison to the French.” This vignette reflects a broader phenomenon, the tendency of multinational corporations (MNCs) from relatively corrupt countries to become successful investors in host countries that have similarly high levels of corruption.====While the ability of MNCs to undertake successful foreign direct investment (FDI) can be explained by many factors, in this paper we explore one specific channel that reflects the insight of the Salvadoran manager that the skills for dealing with corruption are a competitive advantage of MNCs investing in corrupt economies. If the MNC's home country has weak market and legal institutions and thus high levels of corruption, the MNC will develop skills and governance structures that enable it to cope with such an environment. Conversely, firms from countries with good market institutions will develop different competitive skills and organizational structures that reflect their home-country environment. Once these skills and organizational features are developed in the home country, its MNCs are also able to exploit them abroad in host countries with similar levels of corruption and institutions. This idea stems from the seminal work of John Dunning (1998), who argued that MNCs invest in host countries that offer the economic and institutional environment that allows the MNCs’ competitive advantages to be efficiently utilized and that these competitive advantages reflect the MNCs’ home-country environment.====Our model of the effects of corruption on MNCs' investment decisions retains the widely accepted view that host-country corruption influences MNCs’ foreign investment decisions by creating economic environments that are either favorable or unfavorable to rational economic activity. Rather than viewing corruption only as an environmental factor that either facilitates or hinders firms’ activities, we construct a model where a home country's institutions have an important impact on the skills and organization of home-based MNCs and where these skills, in turn, influence MNCs’ choices of host countries in which to invest as well as the amount that they invest.====We test the model using data on bilateral FDI stocks between 43 home countries and 151 host countries for the period 2005–2009. Our results confirm that both host-country corruption levels and differences in corruption levels between home and host countries influence the likelihood and size of bilateral FDI stocks. Our most conservative estimates show that average FDI stocks will be 19% lower, ceteris paribus, for every one-unit decline in the host country's corruption perception index (CPI), and bilateral FDI stocks will be 4% smaller for each additional CPI unit difference between the home and host country.====In the next section of this paper, we present a brief literature survey to place our contribution in the context of the research on MNCs’ FDI decisions. We also discuss the economic intuition for our model and then formally develop it and draw out its implications.

This paper exploits large variation in separatist protests across the 183 provinces of the Soviet Union between 1987 and 1992 to measure the demand for autonomy and secession. This enables an investigation into the theoretical prediction that the incentive to separate should be influenced by the trade-off between the size of the potentially separating jurisdiction and preference heterogeneity. I find evidence consistent with the existence of this trade-off: Regions that are more different from the center along some dimension of heterogeneity see a higher incidence of separatist protests per capita. Likewise, proposals to grant autonomy to large jurisdictions attract disproportionately more popular support. These results persist after controlling for various factors influencing general protest turnout, including repression by the authorities.","Economists have developed a rich theoretical literature that helps to explain the unification or break-up of states. In this literature, state size is often depicted as the result of a trade-off between the benefits of size and its costs (Alesina, Spolaore, 1997, Desmet, Le Breton, Ortuño-Ortín, Weber, 2011). Benefits of size stem from fixed costs in the provision of public goods, which makes living in a small state costly to each individual taxpayer. The costs of size are due to individual heterogeneity, which reduces the utility from the consumption of public goods to those individuals located far away from the government in terms of preferences or geography. If individuals are located far enough from the source of public goods, they may gain by providing public goods themselves, either through secession or through achieving greater autonomy after devolution (Alesina and Spolaore, 2003).====Despite these theoretical predictions, there has been little empirical investigation into the factors influencing the breakup of states. A noteworthy exception is Desmet et al. (2011), who calibrate a model of state fragmentation to successfully postdict the sequence of exit of five Yugoslav republics from their former state. Yet the small number of republics in that historical case clearly limits the scope for econometric exploration. In general, any potential study of the empirical determinants of secessions is likely to be constrained by the fact that actual secessions are still relatively rare occurrences.====This paper attempts to overcome this gap in the literature by studying popular demands for autonomy, rather than acts of outright secession. Specifically, I exploit variation in the number and size of separatist demonstrations across the 183 provinces (oblasts) of the Soviet Union from 1987 to 1992 to construct an estimate of the popular demand for separation. I then proceed to investigate the influence of preference heterogeneity, as well as the influence of size and trade potential of the potentially separating territories, on the extent of separatist protests.====Using separatist protests in the USSR to examine theories of state break-up has a number of distinct advantages.====Firstly, protests demanding autonomy provide ample variation along the intensive and extensive margins. My data records 1727 separatist protests, with 66% of provinces witnessing at least 1 such protest. This is crucial to circumvent the lack of observations in studies of secession referred to above.====Secondly, focusing on the popular demand for separation, rather than on actual outcomes, is most appropriate when examining the theoretical literature. While the theory focuses on secession or autonomy by popular demand, such acts in political practice may have more to do with power considerations by local elites. Protests, on the other hand, allow for an assessment of the popular support for separatist proposals.====Thirdly, the Soviet Union was marked by a high degree of geographical, ethno-linguistic, and historical heterogeneity, thus providing interesting variation in the explanatory variables. At the same time, the break-up of the Soviet Union offers a setting where all regions were part of the same state, keeping a number of confounding institutional variables constant.====Fourthly, the liberalizing reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev provided a historic window of opportunity for separatist protests to take place without being subject to the concerted suppression that characterized the earlier Soviet Union, or indeed some of its successor states. Instead of centralized efforts to squash protests, repression was sporadic and localized (Beissinger, 2002). This means that the regional extent of repression can be controlled for. The relative freedom to protest also allows me to use demonstrations ==== autonomy, as well as non-separatist protests, as a useful placebo check.====Finally, understanding the determinants of popular protests that played a leading role in the break-up of the Soviet Union may be deemed a topic of interest in itself. This is especially true in light of an emerging literature on the political economy of protests. For example, Madestam et al. (2013) use attendance at Tea Party rallies to predict a range of local political outcomes in the US. Similarly, Ponticelli and Voth (2012), Aidt and Franck (2015) and Passarelli and Tabellini (2017) seek to understand the interplay of protests and government policy or voting. Finally, there exists an empirical literature focusing on the determinants of protest participation, focusing on the role of communication channels in mobilizing participants (Acemoglu, Hassan, Tahoun, 2018, Enikopolov, Makarin, Petrova, 2016). Most importantly, Enikopolov et al. (2016) also partly rely on Soviet protest data. The focus of their paper, however, is on explaining anti-governmental protest mobilization in contemporary Russian regions, rather than on separatism.====This paper is also related to a large body of literature that has tried to examine theories of separatism and nationalism stemming from the political science literature. Most importantly, Beissinger (2002) collected protest data from the Soviet Union to explain the development of an ethnically based nationalism for large Soviet minorities. His focus was on nationalities, rather than territories. A different strand of the literature has used official declarations of autonomy by Soviet and Russian regions to provide variation in the disposition to secede (Emizet, Hezli, 1995, Treisman, 1997, Hale, 2000). A number of authors have also used variation in vote shares for separatist parties in large cross-sections of countries (Fearon, van Houten, 2002, Sorens, 2005). In addition to not all being able to offer the advantages of studying separatism within the framework of a single state, none of these contributions examine economic theories of state break-up.====Although this paper does not find causal evidence of the factors shaping secession demands, it finds that the data is consistent with the trade-off between size and heterogeneity proposed in the literature. Proposals to separate larger territories with a high degree of historical distance to the Union witness a higher occurrence of separatist protests ====. However, separatist protests do not seem strongly motivated by other factors emphasized in the literature, such as income differences or trade potential.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section gives an overview of economic theories of separatism. Section 3 describes the political environment in the late Soviet Union. Section 4 uses this information to motivate the empirical model. Section 5 constructs a disaggregated measure of popular separatism, as well as the independent covariates.

Bacon's works are the data in an estimation of a structural topic model, a recently developed methodology for analysis of text corpora. The estimates uncover sixteen topics prominent in Bacon's opus. Two are key elements of the ideas usually associated with Bacon—inductive epistemology and fact-seeking. The utilitarian promise of science and the centralized organization of the scientific quest, embraced by Bacon's followers, were not emphasized by him. Using strategic communication, Bacon facilitated reception of his scientific methodology, targeted influential groups, and finessed powerful opponents. We provide the first quantitative evidence that the genesis of Bacon's epistemology lies in his experience in the common-law. Combining our findings with accepted arguments in the existing literature, we suggest that the effects of common-law culture can help explain the coincidence of early political and economic development in England.","Arguably the fundamental question of comparative economics is why some countries develop and why other countries fail to do so. In the economics literature on this question, the early development of England provides a paradigmatic example, perhaps the single most important data point (North and Weingast, 1989; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012; Mokyr, 2016). The most popular causal interpretation of England's unique early success emphasizes the effect of institutions after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. But this interpretation has two weaknesses. First, supporting evidence is scant, especially quantitative evidence (Murrell, 2017). Second, this interpretation offers no explanation of why England was unique at that time.====A different explanation of England's development might invoke an alternative approach to addressing the fundamental question of comparative economics—a distinctive culture. Mokyr (2016) offers such an alternative approach, pointing to the influence of a new ""culture of growth"". This culture stressed the possibilities of scientific advance and invention, encouraging their application to economic activities, thereby stimulating technological progress and economic growth. Yet despite its appeal, the emphasis on the culture of growth does not quite get to the heart of an explanation of England's rise. In particular, given that the culture of growth is really an 18th century Western European phenomenon, this cultural argument does not directly address the unique precocity of England. If the culture of growth is key, why was England comparatively early in development? One possible answer suggests itself immediately within the confines of Mokyr's argument. Mokyr (2016) identifies Francis Bacon (1561–1626), the preeminent English philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist, and author, as providing a unique stimulus to the emergence of the culture of growth. Indeed, the central ingredient of the culture-of-growth was 'Baconianism', an amorphous set of philosophical and methodological principles advocated by those who adopted and built on Bacon's ideas.====Yet a focus on Bacon immediately leads one to ask: What exactly were his core ideas? And where did those ideas come from? For two important reasons, answering these questions is a key first step in any effort to use a culture-of-growth explanation for England's early economic rise. First, Baconianism and the culture of growth were fully solidified only in the 18th century (Mokyr, 2016, Mokyr, 2005). Thus, to the extent that elements of Baconianism were instrumental in England's rise, it is Bacon's ideas, dating from the late 16th and early 17th century, that would have been particularly important at the onset of England's development, not the 18th century interpretations of Bacon. Second, an understanding of the genesis of Bacon's ideas sheds light on whether those ideas were original with him, or whether he was simply an influential mouthpiece for a culture that already existed. Identifying a pre-existing culture as a crucial input to Bacon's thought, and subsequently into Baconianism, would lead to a very different interpretation of English history than concluding that Baconianism began to emerge ==== as a result of the contributions of the unique genius, Bacon, standing alone.====Methodologically, the focus on culture, and in particular the ideas of one person, raises the thorny question of how to bring to bear the favored tools of economics, quantitative empirics, to understand more about the characteristics and development of specific cultures within historical studies. In this paper, we show how new, machine-learning methods can provide the required methodology and thereby aid in understanding both the features and the origins of Bacon's ideas, a key component of 17th-century English culture. This distinguishes our contribution methodologically from that of the prevailing intellectual history on that period. But as we note in many places in the text below, we also differ from that literature in substantive conclusions about the nature and genesis of Bacon's thought.====We examine the features and the cultural origins of Bacon's works using topic modeling, a recently developed unsupervised machine-learning technique for analysis of large text corpora (Blei et al., 2003; Blei, 2012; Roberts et al., 2014, Roberts et al., 2016a). Topic models produce estimates of a small set of themes (the topics) that are present in an author's work. Applied to Bacon's corpus, the estimated topics identify his core ideas and, by omission, allow identification of those elements of Baconianism that were not in fact emphasized by him. This immediately provides an answer to the first of the questions posed above, on the difference between Bacon's own ideas and Baconianism. Our estimated topic model clearly pinpoints two themes that the intellectual history literature invariably places at the center of Bacon's ideas: the emphasis on probing for facts and the epistemology of generalizing from facts. Importantly, we show that ideas about the utilitarian promise of science and the central direction of science—often attributed to Bacon by his followers—are not prominent in Bacon's own work.====The topic model naturally produces estimates of the connections between the use of different topics, information that can help explain the genesis of Bacon's ideas. The estimates provide strong evidence that Bacon's methodological ideas had their origins in his common-law jurisprudence. Our paper provides the only quantitative evidence to date that bears on this issue, providing insight into the broader culture that existed at the beginning of England's early economic development. The finding about the legal origins of Bacon's methodological ideas is also directly relevant to contentious debates in the existing intellectual history literature on Bacon. As we demonstrate in an extensive literature survey in Appendix A, only a very small subset of the multitude of Bacon scholars has attempted to explicitly investigate a connection between Bacon's scientific methodology and his legal background (Kocher, 1957; Wheeler, 1983; Simonds, 1986; Cardwell, 1990; Martin, 1992: 164–171; Shapiro, 2000: 107–112; Serjeantson, 2014: 701–704). Moreover, the conclusions of these scholars have not been widely accepted in the literature. Additionally, even among this small set of scholars, there is disagreement about which aspect of Bacon's legal background was most influential. In contrast, our methodology produces quantitative evidence in favor of the hypothesis that Bacon's ideas about scientific methodology emerged from his immersion in English common law. As we discuss in the conclusion, this finding has important implications for an understanding of 17th century English culture and for the interpretation of England's comparatively early economic rise.====To set the stage, Section 2 provides a primer on Bacon in the context of the time in which he lived. We offer an overview of key aspects of Bacon's personal and professional life, as well as introduce the powerful actors, social groups, and intellectual paradigms that shaped his actions.====Our formal analysis begins with the specification and estimation of a Structural Topic Model (STM; Roberts et al., 2014, Roberts et al., 2016a), providing machine-learning-based, macroscopic, statistical evidence on the salient features of Bacon's work. STM is a recent innovation in topic modeling that integrates document-level data into the analysis. Given STM's general unfamiliarity to economists, Section 3 details the generative model that underpins STM. With their tremendous scope and breadth, Bacon's writings are particularly suitable for topic modeling.==== In contrast to human analysts, topic models use a 'bag-of-words' conceptualization of texts, enabling the researcher to produce results that are devoid of preconceived notions about the content of texts. (The interpretation of the results is, of course, another matter.) By providing a direct path to an author's own words and allowing the central themes in a corpus to be 'discovered' by an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, the conclusions from topic-model estimates are divorced from the history of scholarly interpretation. Nevertheless, we emphasize that we do not argue that these techniques are superior to existing textual-analysis methods. Instead, we view machine-learning as one more, hitherto unexplored, method of obtaining insight into the nature and sources of cultural ideas.====Section 4 documents the process of building the comprehensive, machine-readable corpus of Bacon's major writings, comprising 282 documents and nearly 900,000 words. Additionally, we associated with each document the values of variables characterizing the form of Bacon's work (e.g. an essay, a letter etc.) and its targeted audience (e.g. philosophers, politicians etc.).====As we discuss in Section 5, STM identifies sixteen topics that are central in Bacon's writings, topics that would not necessarily be obvious to a reader of many disparate documents. These topics provide novel interpretations of the ideas that spanned Bacon's works. By closely examining the specific words and the particular documents that STM associates with each topic, we give each topic an evocative name suggestive of its contents. This is the way in which our unsupervised machine-learning algorithm addresses the question of which ideas Bacon emphasized (and implicitly which parts of Baconianism he did not).====In Section 6, we develop insights into the origins of the principal features of Bacon's work by examining the correlations across documents in the use of disparate topics and the commonalities between topics in the use of distinctive vocabulary. Our analysis demonstrates that Bacon's epistemological reasoning is strongly connected with his ideas about law and legal institutions. Because Bacon was first immersed in law and turned his scholarly attention to natural philosophy only later, this result provides the first systematic quantitative evidence that the origins of Bacon's epistemological ideas lie in his common-law jurisprudence.====Consistent with the comparative social science literature that emphasizes the importance of strategic communication by influential actors (see, e.g., Kuran, 1995), Bacon has often been thought of as communicating his ideas strategically, taking into account multiple powerful constituencies and societal taboos. In Section 7, we make direct use of the defining element of STM, the integration into estimation of document-level information, to explore the way in which Bacon's emphases varied with intended audience and medium of communication. We find, for example, that Bacon emphasized his methodological ideas when addressing groups that he viewed as particularly effective messengers of his thought, choosing to disseminate those ideas in the form that made them most widely available, print. However, he de-emphasized his methodological ideas when addressing monarchs and other politicians. When communicating with politicians, Bacon instead emphasized matters of law that pertained to high politics. Moreover, he communicated those ideas primarily in private letters, carefully shielding them from public discourse. Perhaps, we have found one reason why Bacon's methodological ideas have usually been interpreted as applying more immediately to science than social science or governance, even though he emphasized the universal applicability of those ideas.====Our methodology and our findings complement and supplement the existing literature in a number of additional ways. Apart from its specific implications for the interpretation of the rise of England, to which we return in the conclusion, our paper has broad relevance for the literature on comparative economic development. We contribute to the study of culture (e.g., Guiso et al., 2006, Alesina and Giuliano, 2015), and particularly to the strand of research on culture that has focused on identifying culture's deep historical roots.==== Our paper shows how machine-learning can be used to uncover broad cultural ideas and to estimate the connections between them, providing insights into their historical origins. In particular, we provide a new view within economics on why the common-law was important, focusing on its cultural influence rather than on the shaping of institutional arrangements (see, e.g., Djankov et al., 2003, Beck et al., 2003, Rafael et al., 2008, Guerriero, 2016). Additionally, by isolating the source of Bacon's ideas, we provide perspective on the question of how important the ideas and actions of influential individuals are in shaping fundamental social and institutional change, relative to more deeply rooted forces (see, e.g., Hughes, 1986, Jones and Olken, 2005, Besley et al., 2011, Brender and Drazen, 2013).====We also contribute by applying machine-learning in economics and in comparative economics in particular. Our paper is unique in economics in applying such methods to historical-cultural questions. It lies in a class of work that is beginning to appear in other social sciences—quantitative analyses of culture produced by examining the recorded ideas of important social actors (see, e.g., Blaydes et al., 2018, Lucas et al., 2015: Section 4; Roberts et al., 2014). Within economics, topic modeling has been employed only very recently.==== The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al., 2003, Blei, 2012) approach has been applied in understanding monetary policymaking (Fligstein et al., 2014; Hansen and McMahon, 2016; Hansen et al., 2018), financial market performance (Larsen and Thorsrud, 2015; Huang et al., 2016), and corporate behavior (Bandiera et al., 2017; Bellstam et al., 2016). We move beyond LDA, and use Structural Topic Modeling (Roberts et al., 2014, Roberts et al., 2016a), integrating document-level data into our analysis.====Lastly, this paper is relevant to the voluminous intellectual history literature on Bacon and Baconianism. The interest of scholars in the features of Bacon's ideas, and their connectedness, has inspired a voluminous literature in the history of science, political philosophy, and intellectual history more broadly. Within this literature there are many contentious debates on the nature of Bacon's ideas and the source of those ideas. In the details of the paper, we comment on how our results are relevant to those debates, which hypotheses our paper rejects, and which it accepts.",Toward understanding 17th century English culture: A structural topic model of Francis Bacon's ideas,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718304426,March 2019,2019,Research Article,253.0

First, it documents an institutional divergence inside the region with long lasting effects on subsequent political and economic development. Second, it develops a theoretical model focusing on two factors to explain institutional development, the risk of native and slave uprisings and technical change, both of which were observed throughout the region at that time. The risk of rebellions leads to institutions that weakly restrict the powers of chief executives, in order to allow them to react forcefully to them. Technical change leads to stricter restrictions as expropriation becomes more costly, but it also intensifies labor coercion and consequently the risk of rebellions. Hence the main prediction is that the effect of technical change depends on the availability of coerced labor, their interaction being a potential explanation for the institutional divergence. Finally the paper conducts an ==== exercise to test this hypothesis. Results from panel-data regressions suggest that the dynamics of the institutional gap in Latin America can be explained to a large extent by the interaction between the risk of rebellions and technical change in transportation.","After almost 200 years since achieving its independence, the economic performance of Latin America has been disappointing. This resource-rich region has been unable to catch-up with the developed world, and has even fallen behind other initially poorer former colonies. More strikingly, despite a common colonial experience, Latin America has the highest dispersion in GDP per capita among world developing regions as defined by the World Bank.====This weak economic performance has been the focus of a large body of research, mostly narrative, where common features, particularly the colonial heritage manifested in inefficient institutions and geographic features, which have contributed to disparities in wealth and significant racial diversity, have been identified as crucial factors behind Latin America’s relative underdevelopment (Engerman, Sokoloff, 1997, Engerman, Sokoloff, 2002, North, Summerhill, Weingast, 2000, Lange, Mahoney, Vom Hau, 2006). The literature on the colonial determinants of development, which empirically studies the causes and long-run consequences for the introduction of certain legal and political institutions by colonial powers around the world, can also shed some light on the causes of economic backwardness in Latin America (La Porta, de Silanes, Shleifer, Vishny, 1998, Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001, Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2002). However, strong similarities across Latin American countries in terms of fundamental economic growth determinants and post-independence institutional and economic development, hinder comparative studies within the region about the long-run causes of underdevelopment. Additionally, the lack of theoretical models that can guide quantitative analysis make it difficult to apply the findings in the literature to the particular case of Latin America.====This paper pursues a dynamic comparative analysis among Latin American economies of ==== determinants of long-run development, i.e. political institutions, to explain current differences in economic outcomes within the region. In order to do this it develops a theoretical model, which together with a historical analysis, guides an econometric exercise.====Political institutions in Latin America have transited through distinct stages since independence (Drake, 2009, Hartlyn, Valenzuela, 1998). This paper focuses on the first period of institutional development, which started some decades after independence and ended with the consolidation of oligarchic republics, or protected democracy, in the first decades of the twentieth century. These robust civilian and constitutional regimes, featuring open, although very restrictive and not fully fair, electoral competition, were “largely comparable to the restrictive representative regimes in Europe of the same period”, and even though they were replaced by authoritarian regimes, these disruptions did not represent serious breaks with the past in most of the countries (Hartlyn and Valenzuela, 1998, p.3 and 42). Within oligarchic regimes there were important differences; while rule was exercised by reasonably republican regimes in some countries, it was done by fundamentally authoritarian ones in others, and they either led to gradual incorporation of excluded groups, or to intensified oppression (Drake, 2009, p.129). It has been identified as a crucial period of transition, with a profound impact on subsequent patterns of change in Latin America (Collier, Collier, 1991, Paige, 1998, Mahoney, 2001, Coatsworth, 2005).====To understand the early development of political institutions in Latin America the paper proceeds in three stages. First it quantitatively documents a divergence of political institutions in the region starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, primarily in the extent of influence different members of the elite had in the decision making process, i.e. in the constraints imposed on executives. The paper then presents a historical analysis to identify two factors that can be associated with the determinants of political institutions in Latin America. First, the risk of uprisings, which were closely related to the exploitation of natives and slaves, identified by historians as an important risk for the elites throughout the region (Katz, 1988, Coatsworth, 1988, Coatsworth, 2008, Chevalier, 2005, Eakin, 2007, Williamson, 2009, Rouquié, 2010).==== Second, the first era of globalization, led by a worldwide transport revolution (North, 1958, Harley, 1988, Mohammed, Williamson, 2004), that served to integrate the region with the global economy (Williamson, 2006), and to generate new economic opportunities for the economy as a whole. These two processes were interrelated, as economic expansion increased the risk of uprisings in countries with large indigenous and slave populations (Bauer, 1986, Coatsworth, 1988, Coatsworth, 2005, Chevalier, 2005, Eakin, 2007, Sánchez, López-Uribe, Fazio, 2010).====The second stage consists of a theoretical analysis that focuses on the determinants of political institutions to explain the divergence. In the model there is an elite that faces a risk of uprisings by external groups. This uprisings are driven by coerced labor used in production, and they have certain features that make them of particular relevance in the historical context of this paper. First, they affect only certain members of the elite. This feature implies that the benefit of fighting an insurgency is not internalized equally by the elite’s members, and hence there is disagreement in terms of the size of an eventual response if taxes need to be raised to finance it. Second, it is highly uncertain who will be affected by future uprisings, implying that disagreement on the size of the response is low ex-ante since the expected benefits of fighting are shared more evenly among members of the elite. Thus, elite members would like to commit in advance to a larger military response to conflicts than the one they are willing to sustain once a conflict has erupted. One way of solving this is by empowering the executive so he may react forcefully to conflicts, despite the opposition of some fraction of the elite. However doing this raises the likelihood of expropriation, as the executive is able to tax more freely. Elite members then face a trade-off: imposing fewer constraints on the executive reduces the expected costs from uprisings, but on the other hand it distorts investment incentives.==== The first implication of the model follows; more labor available to be coerced, which leads to a higher likelihood of a rebellion in the future, incites the elite to impose fewer constraints on the executive.====There is also a dynamic dimension of the model generated by technical change: the trade-off between military reactions to conflicts and the risk of expropriation is dependent on the returns to investment. Expropriation is particularly costly when returns to investment are high, and hence technological advance may lead to the imposition of more constraints on executive power. But on the other hand higher productivity raises the demand for coerced labor, which, in the model, drives rebellions and consequently the benefits of empowering the executive. This last effect is stronger, and may dominate the first one, in countries where the availability of involuntary labor is larger. Therefore the second prediction of the model is that the response of institutions to technical change depends on the potential to exploit non elites. In countries where it is possible to coerce a larger fraction of the labor force the change in executive constraints due to an increase in productivity is smaller, and it can even be negative. This implies that, in this particular context, institutional variation rises with technology, which could potentially explain the early divergence in political institutions in Latin America.====The last stage is to empirically test the model predictions. Econometric results suggest that countries prone to racial conflict due to a high fraction of the population comprised of natives and slaves, were the ones that showed fewer constraints at the end of the divergence process. But the focus of the empirical section is on the second prediction of the model, which can be tested exploiting time variation. Panel regression results from 1850 to 1910 show that the interaction between our proxy for the availability of involuntary labor and a measure of technological progress in navigation is highly significant explaining the evolution of executive constraints in the region. In line with the prediction of the model, the lower the availability of labor to be coerced, the larger the effect of the worldwide transport revolution on political institutions. Hence this process, that only started long after independence, helped to widen the institutional gap across the region. The results are robust to different specifications and estimation methods, to the inclusion of additional controls associated with alternative theories linking colonial experiences and long-run development, to the exclusion of individual countries from the sample, and to variations in the proxies for involuntary labor and transport technologies.====In their seminal paper on the economic reversal in former colonies, Acemoglu et al. (2002) show that economic divergence took place long after independence, although its deep determinant, the nature of political institutions, was determined during the colonial period. In this paper we show that inside Latin America political institutions started to diverge long after independence, and that their economic effects started to be felt even later. Hence, like Coatsworth (2005), we consider the processes that occurred at the end of the nineteenth century as key for understanding the link between colonial development and modern economic performance in the region. The main contribution of this paper is to document this fact and elaborate a theory able to explain it. In order to do this the paper is organized as follows. After reviewing the related literature the next section studies the early development of political institutions in Latin America. Section 3 presents a historical review of two possible determinants of political institutions, namely the risk of rebellions and technical change. Section 4 presents the theoretical model, and its implications for Latin America are discussed and tested in section 5. The last section concludes.","Rebellions, Technical Change, and the Early Development of Political Institutions in Latin America",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596718304323,March 2019,2019,Research Article,254.0
